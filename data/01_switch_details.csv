CHARACTERS:

JURO KURABE
A mild-mannered young high school student trying to live a normal life in the 80s. Rarely excited, he is fond of campy old Sci-Fi movies, with their giant robots and space invasions. But it seems like everyone in his life is trying to manipulate him for their own ominous ends...

IORI FUYUSAKA
She believes she's an ordinary high school girl, with dreams and crushes and a sweet tooth. However, she finds herself at the center of a massive conspiracy, called on to stop an apocalypse before the world is doomed. What she's not sure about is: can she really answer the call?
EI SEKIGAHARA
A stoic young man with amnesia, Ei finds himself next to a dead body without any memories of his past. Declared a boy ""from another dimension"", he's constantly pursued by armed gunmen in black suits, and often finds himself in intense life-or-death situations. Through investing the clues and people in 1985, he chases the truth beyond his lost memories...
KEITARO MIURA
A dutiful young soldier from 1945, fiercely dedicated to defending his country. He'd lay down his life if it meant saving even a single soul. Chosen as part of a secret military program to pilot a new weapon called a ""Sentinel"", Miura soon discovers that his true enemies lie beyond World War II...
MEGUMI YAKUSHIJI
A shy, composed girl of few words, with a nurturing domestic side. While she's devoted to her beloved, Juro, he himself has lost all memory of their past relationship. Goaded on by a mysterious talking cat, she agrees to a ""contract"" -- willing to go to any length to restore the boy she loves.
NATSUNO MINAMI
A perky, friendly girl on her high school's track team who loves a good Sci-Fi story. When she discovers a small robot hiding in the school, it seems like a story out of one of her favorite movies. However, she finds herself drawn into a massive, apocalyptic conspiracy in which the dangers of her favorite shows becomes disturbingly real.
NENJI OGATA
A high school punk with a heart of gold. He prefers to punch first and ask questions later, so when he gets involved in a convoluted conspiracy, most of the geek-talk goes over his head. Still, he's determined to bust through and save the girl -- even if he's resigned to her thinking he's just another thug.
RENYA GOUTO
A cold, brilliant young man who will use any means necessary to find the truth. Gouto processes information and startling revelations with a calm, ready intelligence that baffles (or outpaces) the adults around him. He's no villain, but he knows what's at stake, and what must be done.
RYOKO SHININOME
An aloof agent desperate to prove her worth to her unrequited love (and mentor) Tetsuya Ida. A mission gone wrong left Ryoko with traumatic brain damage, and dependent on a medicine of unclear origins. Still, she fights through the mental fog and pain to untangle the conspiracies...
SHU AMIGUCHI
An easygoing late-80s high school playboy, quick to make friends and quick to flirt. Tries not to take life too seriously, whether it's on his side or not. But when his TV turns on by itself, and an idol starts talking to him through it, begging for his help unraveling a mystery...he rolls with it as best he can.

Inspired by classic Japanese shooting games, Danmaku Unlimited 3 is a lovingly crafted medley of the best aspects of Japanese bullet hell games, all in a polished, accessible package.

An old school shoot'em up? Why is it worth my time?
Bullet hell style mechanics is having a kind of renaissance with its inclusion in many hit indie games. However if players want to explore more into the world of Bullet Hell a lot of traditional titles can be hard to understand in its mechanics or just plain too difficult to get into as a newcomer.

Danmaku Unlimited 3 is designed to be intuitive and accessible to players unfamiliar with the genre, all the while without losing any of the intensity and flashiness that makes the genre so exciting to play.

Okay, so how does the game do that?
CORE A staple feature in Bullet Hells, only the very center of the player's craft, the core, is vulnerable to enemy fire.

GRAZING Get the core close to bullets to just barely ""graze"" it will power up the player's craft. Once fully charged it can unleash a powerful rampage that makes you feel like a total boss.

SPIRIT/GRAZE SYSTEM Shooting down enemies turns their shots into harmless ghost bullets that the player can safely touch while also powering up the plane.

All of this allows the game to be at a level of challenge that is manageable for a wide range of players without reducing the game into a bullet free turkey shoot.
I'm good at bullet hell shooters, won't I just breeze though the game then?
The game has two unique modes, GRAZE MODE features a differently tuned system (with conditions to trigger the ghost bullets) that offers a higher level of challenge comparable to the toughest traditional bullet hell titles.
Is there a story?
It is about a guardian, entrusted with Earth, rebelling against her overseers. Shakespeare it isn't, but you are here for the bullets and explosions right?
How is the music? A Shmup is nothing without good music!
Music is by BLANKFIELD from Japan, who does awesome remixes of Touhou and many other anime/game musics!
Anything else?

- The campaign features 5 stages each ending with an epic multi-stage boss fight.
- Up to 25 weapon combinations for players to unlock and experiment to find what works best for them.
- Unique rendering technique that procedurally animate sprites on the fly.
- TATE support for players that use vertical screens. Or if you like to play lying down on your sides, I'm not going to tell you how to live your life.

Okay I'm sold! (Or not, if so then thanks for making it down to here!)

TLDR List

- Authentically crafted Japanese style shoot'em up in High Definition
- Intuitively designed to be an accessible gateway to the world of Bullet Hell
- 5 handcrafted stages packed with dynamically rendered sprites
- Epic multi-phase boss battles with spellbinding bullet patterns
- Up to 25 unique weapon combinations
- Turn enemy attacks into your advantage with the SPIRIT/GRAZE system

Every cycle you get up and choose what to do with your time. Toil in the yards, or take a bar shift. Search the markets for rare components or grab some street food. Make or break alliances, uncover truths and escape those that hunt you. Learn to survive and ultimately thrive, one cycle at a time.

TURN UP FOR YOUR FRIENDS
The station plays host to characters from all walks of life, trying to eke out an existence among the stars. Salvagers, engineers, hackers, bartenders, street-food vendors, each has a history which brought them here. You choose which of them you wish to help, and together you will shape your future.

ACCESS THEIR SECRETS
Hack into the station’s cloud to access decades of digital data, uncover new areas and unlock secrets. This is your unique power, and with it you can change your future. Corporate secrets, rogue AIs and troves of lost data await those willing to dive into the depths of the station’s networks.

YOU WERE MADE TO DIE
Essen-Arp: to them you are just property, one more asset in a portfolio that stretches across the stars. You are the product of an abusive system, in a universe where humanity’s expansion is marked by exploitation and extraction. Escape the makers of your decaying body, and chart your own path in a richly imagined, deeply relevant sci-fi world which explores ideas of precarity, personhood and freedom.

pokemon-legends-arceus,https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/pokemon-legends-arceus,"Nintendo , The Pokemon Company",Game Freak,"Jan 28, 2022",,"A Bold New Direction. The Pokémon Legends: Arceus game honors past Pokémon games' core gameplay while infusing new action and RPG elements. You'll need to catch, survey, and research wild Pokémon in a long-gone era of the Sinnoh region to create and complete the region's first Pokédex.
-Catch Pokémon-
To catch Pokémon in the Pokémon Legends: Arceus game, you can observe them to learn their behavior, then carefully sneak up, aim your Poké Ball, and let fly!

You can also have your ally Pokémon battle wild Pokémon that you hope to catch. Just throw the Poké Ball holding your ally Pokémon near a wild Pokémon, and you'll seamlessly enter battle and command your Pokémon by choosing from moves it knows.

-An Adventure in the Sinnoh of Days Gone By-
You'll be brought to the Sinnoh region, the setting for the Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl games. But this story unfolds in a long-gone era, before ideas such as being a Pokémon Trainer or having a Pokémon League even existed.

All around, you'll find Pokémon living wild in harsh environments that make for a Sinnoh unlike the region you may remember from the days of the Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl games.

The Poké Balls of old were apparently built a little differently from the ones we know so well. They were made mostly of wood, and steam puffed from their tops when Pokémon were caught.
-Meet Your First Partner Pokémon-
As you start off on your adventure to create the region's first Pokédex, you'll be able to choose Rowlet, Cyndaquil, or Oshawott as a partner.

These three Pokémon arrived with a Pokémon Professor, who encountered them on research excursions to various regions.
Rowlet
Category: Grass Quill Pokémon
Type: Grass/Flying
Height: 1'
Weight: 3.3 lbs.

Rowlet is a Pokémon from the Alola region. It uses photosynthesis to store up energy during the day, while becoming active at night. Silently it glides, drawing near its targets. Before they even notice it, it begins to pelt them with vicious kicks.

Cyndaquil
Category: Fire Mouse Pokémon
Type: Fire
Height: 1'8""
Weight: 17.4 lbs.

Cyndaquil is a Pokémon from the Johto region. It is timid and always curls itself up in a ball. When it's surprised, the flames on its back flare up stronger. When it is attacked, it uses its flames to protect itself.

Oshawott
Category: Sea Otter Pokémon
Type: Water
Height: 1'8""
Weight: 13 lbs.

Oshawott is a Pokémon from the Unova region. With the scalchop on its stomach, it blocks opponents' attacks, then retaliates immediately by slashing. Its scalchop can be used to break open hard Berries as well.

Arceus
Holding the key to this tale is the Pokémon known as Arceus. Arceus is said to have shaped all there is in this world. Just how is this mighty Pokémon connected to your journey?

Category: Alpha Pokémon
Type: Normal

Koji Igarashi and Inti Creates are back with more retro sword-and-whip action!

Curse of the Moon 2 brings classic 2D action and a dark, 8-Bit aesthetic together with modern playability. The multi-scenario structure of the previous title returns with an epic new story supervised by IGA (Koji Igarashi) himself.
Players take control of Zangetsu, a swordsman from the far east who bears a deep grudge against demonkind and the alchemists who summoned them. Zangetsu must battle his way to the demonic stronghold, but he doesn't have to do it alone! Zangetsu can ally himself with a brand new cast of characters he meets along the way and add them to the playable roster. Each new character adds a variety of gameplay options, abilities, and ways to complete the game's many stages.
Game Flow
Battle through stages filled with fearsome enemies and dangerous traps, each with a massive boss waiting at the end. A chance encounter with a potential ally awaits you after defeating a boss. Will they serve as a trustworthy partner on your perilous journey?

Increase Combat Abilities
You can instantaneously switch between allies you have recruited at any time! Allies have their own life bars, so with each ally you recruit, you're survivability is greatly increased!
Shortcuts that Only Allies Can Access
Allies have special, unique abilities which allow them to use shortcuts to skip parts of stages or access new areas! There are no special items obtainable by taking the long way around, so take every shortcut you can find! If your allies are out of commission, you'll have to take longer routes, where stronger enemies await! When your life gets low, be sure to switch then out so they'll be available when you need them.

Multiple Episodes
The story is told over the course of multiple episodes. Only the first episode is accessible at the beginning, but more episodes will unlock as you progress through the game. The events that unfold in each episode continue into the next one, so be sure to unlock all the episodes to see the true ending.
Curse of the Moon 2 had two play styles, ""Veteran"" and ""Casual"".
Veteran Style
Choose ""Veteran"" style to experiment a difficulty reminiscent of older games. An enemy's sttack knocks the player to their death...something very familiar to retro game fans.
Casual Style
Even if you're a fan of challenging games, sometimes you just want to take it easy! Casual mode is perfect for times like that. On Casual Style, things are more forgiving. Attacks don't knock the player back and lives are unlimited, alongside other changes.
Changing Style
Style can be changed when starting a game, loading a save file, or on the Game Over screen.

Classics that defined the Castlevania series.

This KONAMI Castlevania Collection is designed to be a collection around the origins of the historic franchise.
Included is a unique eBook that has details provided by developers, artists and other inspired by the Castlevania legacy.
Released as part of the KONAMI 50th Anniversary celebration, now the best time to relive these timeless classics that helped define the platformer genre.

Game List:

Castlevania (1987/US, 1988/EU)
Enter At Your Own Risk! If you think it's scary on the outside, wait till you see the basement.
You're in for the longest night of your life. Ghosts, goblins, demons, wolves, bats creatures lurking around every corner. Better pick up a weapon or two, because when you finally meet the Count, you know he'll be going for the jugular.

Castlevania Simon's Quest1988/US, 1990/EU) NES
This title tells the tale of Simon's subsequent adventures following the events in Castlevania.
Unlike the previous installment, this one was developed as an action RPG. It maintains the action elements of its predecessor but mainly focuses on exploration and puzzle solving within a far more expansive game world.

Castlevania Dracula's Curse (1990/US, 1992/EU) NES
Led by the immortal Count Dracula, the greatest army of evil ever assembled is poised to bury mankind in a tomb of terror. Destroying His legions will be the supreme challenge for the mightiest warrior.
100 years before Simon Belmont's birth, Dracula is young at heart and it will take more than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of Trevor - Simon's forefather and the original vampire slayer.

Super Castlevania (1991/US, 1992/EU) SNES
A century of Transylvanian tranquility is about to come to a shocking end. Once again the mortifying screams of helpless villagers shake the ground as they shrink from new horrors unleashed by the Duke of Darkness, Count Dracula. And this time he has a tombstone with your name on it, Simon Belmont.

Castlevania The Adventure (1989/US, 1991/EU) GB
This is the first title in the series to be released on the Game Boy handheld game console.
The variety of power-ups available for the whip added depth to the strategy of the gameplay.

Castlevania Belmont's Revenge (1991/US, 1992/EU) GB
Fifteen years after vanquishing the evil Count Dracula, Christopher Belmont now faces a vampire swearing vengeance. Drac's back. And he's turned your son, Soleil Belmont, into a deadly demon to do his dirty deeds. To rescue him from the Count's clutches, you must first track him down through four creep packed castles.

Castlevania Bloodlines (1994) GEN
Unlike the medieval setting of the other titles, this installment takes place during World War I. It introduces new elements to the series, such as the ability to choose one of two characters when starting the game.
Huge bosses with dynamic, multi-jointed limbs that move erratically are just one of the many examples of the cutting-edge effects the game had for the time.

Kid Dracula (1990/Japan exclusive) NES
With its laugh-inducing content and world full of gags, this spinoff is unlike anything else in the series. Players take control of Dracula's son (or so he says...), Kid Dracula, as he goes on a hilarious adventure filled with laughs that also satisfies as a full-fledged action game.

In 2013 the world was devastated by an apocalyptic event, annihilating almost all mankind and turning the earth’s surface into a poisonous wasteland. A handful of survivors took refuge in the depths of the Moscow underground, and human civilization entered a new Dark Age.

The year is 2033. An entire generation has been born and raised underground, and their besieged Metro Station-Cities struggle for survival, with each other, and the mutant horrors that await outside.

You are Artyom, born in the last days before the fire, but raised underground. Having never ventured beyond the city limits, one fateful event sparks a desperate mission to the heart of the Metro system, to warn the remnants of mankind of a terrible impending threat.

But will they even listen? Rather than stand united, the factions of the Metro are locked in a struggle for the ultimate power, a doomsday device from the military vaults of D6. A civil war is stirring that could wipe humanity from the face of the earth forever.

Including the epic single-player campaigns of both Metro 2033 and Metro: Last Light, Metro Redux takes you on a journey from the forgotten catacombs beneath the subway to the desolate wastelands above, where your actions will determine the fate of mankind.

Metro Redux is the ultimate double game collection, including the definitive versions of both Metro 2033 and Metro: Last Light, now available on Nintendo Switch™

Newcomers to the series will get the chance to experience two of the finest story-driven shooters of all time in one vast package; an epic adventure combining gripping survival horror, exploration and tactical combat and stealth.

The game that defined the survival-horror genre is back! Check out the remastered HD version of Resident Evil.

In 1998 a special forces team is sent to investigate some bizarre murders on the outskirts of Raccoon City. Upon arriving they are attacked by a pack of blood-thirsty dogs and are forced to take cover in a nearby mansion. But the scent of death hangs heavy in the air. Supplies are scarce as they struggle to stay alive.

Graphics:

* More detailed graphics that retain the horror.
* The environments come alive with detail thanks to resolution upgrades and non-static 3D models.
* Post-processing effects like Bloom filters, which were not easy to do at the time of the original release, have been added to make the HD graphics even more realistic.
* High-Resolution Environments - We've increased the resolution of the background environments by recreating them with a mix of high-res static images, plus animated 3D models.
* Widescreen (16:9) is supported, so players can experience a greater sense of immersion.
In widescreen mode, the screen will scroll. The parts of the screen that get cut off on the top and bottom will scroll into view automatically depending on the character's position.
* You can switch the display mode during gameplay in real time.

Sound:
* High-Quality Sound - The audio has been remastered to increase the sampling rate, and of course 5.1ch output is also now supported.
* You can play using the original control scheme or an alternate control scheme that lets you just push the analog stick to move in the direction you want to go.

Story:
In a far future, Earth was devastated by mutants who took control after a worldwide catastrophic event known as ""the big pulse"", a global scale electromagnetic pulse that put an end to all electronic technology on the planet. Humans are now enslaved by mutants led by ""The Boss"" in a world ruled by ""the law of the jungle"".
However, not everything is lost two humans and a mutant rebel are willing to fight in order to stop this madness. Will they be strong enough? Well... that's up to you!

Main Characters:
Gal: A girl who escaped from traders of humans. She's an expert in her own kick-boxing-derived martial art. While her attacks don't have a long reach, her speed and agility have no equal and her technique and endurance are pretty good too. She is capable of avoiding almost every attack, an ability that comes in handy when facing multiple foes.

Ricardo: A minotaur human-rights activist and a powerful wrestler. He's not very fast and his technique isn't as good as his comrades', but he has a pretty long reach, and his power and endurance are amazing. He's capable of destroying any enemy in record time!

F. Norris: A runaway ninja whose past is a mystery. He's the one who mastered the ninjutsu style known as ""the forbidden technique"". While he might be pretty fragile compared to Gal or Ricardo, he has a great combination of reach, power and speed, plus an amazing technique that (when mastered) can take control of any situation.

Business is as usual in the isolated research city of Rokumei–that is until several explosions suddenly go off in the nuclear research facility known as “LABO.” The city sends in “Sirius,” an elite rescue squad, to deal with the situation. But the situation only gets worse when LABO’s nuclear reactor melts down, sending the facility into lockdown–with members of Sirius and survivors still trapped inside. With lethal radiation leaking everywhere and not enough anti-radiation medication to last until lockdown lifts, the survivors make more and more grim discoveries. In their struggle for survival, in a deathtrap full of fire and radiation, they learn that doubt is their greatest enemy, and trust their greatest asset.

The story of Root Double features two different protagonists: Watase Kasasagi, a rescue squad captain who has lost his memories in the hours after the incident, and Natsuhiko Tenkawa, a student piecing together the clues in the six days before. The only key to survival lies in the player’s hands with the Senses Sympathy System (SSS). Unlike traditional visual novels, Root Double does not have clear cut “choices,” but rather, the game uses SSS to allow the player to manipulate the story based purely upon emotion. Your emotions projected upon the characters, particularly your trust in them, shape the progression of the story. Only with effective use of this system and completion of both protagonists’ stories can the player piece together the truth and hope to discover a way out of the facility.

Move objects to the designated platform and balance, arrange, and build to help earthlings complete jobs! Tasks range from farming, fishing, and stacking cheerleaders. Wait…what? Each puzzling job has multiple objectives hinted at through pictures. Solve them to earn in-game medals and unlock even more jobs—just keep an eye on the timer.

Pass a Joy-Con™ controller to a friend for some duo UFO puzzle solving

Recruit a friend and complete any job in cooperative mode. Each job also has a more difficult variation that’s perfect for two players. Jobs may have more objects to move or other challenges to keep the action fresh for your UFO buddy. Two claws are better than one!

Reach for the stars (and a high score) in the Tower of Infinity

The sky’s the limit in the Tower of Infinity mode! Stack objects that are flown in on helicopters to build the tallest tower you can. Be careful not to let anything fall of the platform or the round will end. A second player can join you on your journey to build the tallest tower possible.

Take on jobs like helping a farmer load a truck, arranging circus animals, and rebuilding a temple. In addition to the medals you’ll earn to unlock other stages, you’ll receive some in-game currency for each job you complete. Redeem your hard-earned currency for adorably useful costumes. Dress like a ninja for a sneaky look and a speed boost, or don the safety helmet to stop quickly when zooming around the screen.
Check out the Feats of Glory for extra challenges to complete as you play. For example, try to transport a total of 160 objects across all jobs or get a total of 54 medals. Complete four of these feats to unlock an animated illustration.
Once you master your claw-swinging, object-stacking skills, you can go for a treasure hunt! In this mode you must solve puzzles and collect treasure as you explore treacherous ruins.

Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption is an epic - and humorous - fantasy adventure and role-playing game in which you take on the role of Shawn O'Conner, a young man striving to become a hero as well as a rogue.

Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption is the work of Lori Ann Cole and Corey Cole, creators of Quest for Glory, Shannara, Castle of Dr. Brain, and Mixed-Up Fairy Tales. Although Hero-U is not a direct sequel to the Quest for Glory games, it features the same mix of adventure, role-playing, humor, and immersive storytelling that we introduced in that series.

Shawn can become the Rogue of the Year while exploring a mysterious castle, making friends and enemies, fighting deadly foes, and uncovering the secrets of his own hidden past. Meanwhile players will enjoy the rich and humorous dialogue and descriptions as they guide Shawn through his adventures.

During the day, Shawn attends classes at the University, practices his skills, and tries to make friends with other students. At night, it's time to pull out weapons, armor, and traps to explore the abandoned wine cellars, stunning sea caves, creepy catacombs, and deadly dungeon beneath Hero-U. Most combat is optional for those who prefer a pure adventure game, but there are ample rewards for those who choose to valorously fight the creatures that threaten the school and all of Sardonia.

Sam is a six-foot canine detective with a love of justice. Max is a hyperkinetic rabbity-thing with a taste for mayhem.

Together, they’re the Freelance Police. And they’re about to save the world.

In 2006, the comic book crime-fighting duo Sam & Max starred in the first full-fledged episodic game from Telltale, the studio that went on to make The Walking Dead and Batman: The Enemy Within.

Now everyone’s favorite dog and rabbity-thing are back in Sam & Max Save the World Remastered, a new version of their first season of episodic games that has been lovingly updated by a small group of the original developers with the blessing of Sam & Max creator Steve Purcell.

It’s just another day at the office for the self-proclaimed Freelance Police when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam and Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the “spinny thing” they do with their eyes.)

Who’s the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam’s nose for detective work, Max’s lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam & Max’s street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds.

Return to the adventure game that was once called “gaming’s first sitcom” and is today known as “the remaster you didn’t know you were waiting for.” With enhanced graphics, Joy-Con™ and touch screen support, an original jazz score with five new tracks, and the same brain-tickling puzzles and offbeat humor that won it IGN’s Best Adventure GOTY award back in the day, Sam & Max Save the World Remastered is a modern classic that will be right at home in your Nintendo Switch™ library.

El Hijo: A Wild West Tale is an exciting spaghetti-western stealth game, in which you guide a 6-year-old boy on his quest to find his mother.

As a six-year-old, ""El Hijo"" must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence and cunning and with it more schemes to get past his foes. On his journey, he will find himself in a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy.

The journey begins when a farmer and her son El Hijo are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave ""El Hijo"" at a secluded monastery in order to protect him. However, El Hijo decides that the monastic life is not for him and decides to escape. ""El Hijo - A Wild West Tale"" is a non-violent stealth game. Violence is instead exchanged with the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Shadowplay is in the core of the game and ""El Hijo"" will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined with each other to increase the challenge.

dragon-quest-iii-the-seeds-of-salvation,https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/dragon-quest-iii-the-seeds-of-salvation,Square Enix,Square Enix,"Sep 27, 2019",iPhone/iPad,"An epic RPG with staggering depth, Dragon Warrior III immerses you in a deep adventure that you won't soon forget. Known as Dragon Quest in Japan, the Dragon Warrior series has produced some of the most popular RPGs of all time, and for good reason. Enix caters to their fans with an obsessive attention to detail, creating a universe which is both whimsical and realistic at the same time.

You get to control a young hero (male or female) in the land of Aliahan who is called upon by the king to defeat the Demon Lord Baramos. Your quest will take you through more than 50 caves, dungeons and towns, each filled with monsters to defeat and puzzles to solve. You can stock your traveling party with three companions from nine character classes, each with unique strengths and weaknesses.

U.S. gamers got their first taste of Dragon Warrior III in 1992, when the game was released for the original Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was massive even for a home console system, and Enix has upped the ante even more with the Game Boy Color version. Revamped graphics make the game look better than ever, new twists to the storyline keep things fresh, and plenty of other changes help to give the adventure a rejuvenated feel.

One of the most intriguing changes is the addition of a personality system. You're asked a series of questions when the game begins, and you are assigned a unique personality depending on your responses. There are over two dozen possible personality traits, and the game changes depending on your character's personality and gender. If you don't like the way you've been labeled, you can always read a book or two to alter your personality.

Monster Medals are another new feature in the Game Boy Color version. Monster Medals are sometimes left behind after you defeat an enemy, and come in three varieties: Bronze, Silver and Gold. Using a Game Boy Game Link Cable, you can trade Monster Medals with your friends to try to complete your collection.

There are over 150 different monsters to strike down throughout the game, including some new monsters like SeaSlime. The bad guys look great, because they were all designed by Akira Toriyama, creator of Dragon Ball Z.

Romancing SaGa 2, originally released only in Japan in 1993, has been completely remastered and now receives its first ever official English translation!

No two players will experience the story in the same way

The SaGa series is one of Square Enix's most beloved. The first three titles were originally branded overseas under the ""FINAL FANTASY LEGEND"" moniker , and garnered critical acclaim for their complex yet compelling combat system.

Romancing SaGa 2 takes the varied gameplay of other entries in the series and combines it with an open-ended free-form scenario system whose story is as vast as the world in which it plays out. The player takes the role of a succession of emperors, painting the history of the world with each and every action.

Familiar series hallmarks such as formations and glimmers make a return in this unique title.

Story

It all begins with the song of a lone bard in a bustling pub.

Great nations such as the Varennes Empire, which had once ensured peace throughout the world, stagnated and atrophied over the course of centuries, and sinister forces started emerging in outlying areas.

Ere long, peace spiraled into war and the common folk spoke in hushed words of the Seven Heroeshistorical figures who saved the world once and who, it was hoped, would do so again.

Sol Divide
Vorg heard a rumor that the army of Satan was searching for treasures called Seirei stones which led him to think that the time for revenge has come. In addition, he also knows that one of the Seirei stones was entrusted secretly to King Silverna from Vorg's homeland, the Kingdom of Miltia.

Vorg, who was a holy knight in Miltia, was in the forest town of Neraphai working for a mission when the king of Satan, Ifter, invaded the Kingdom of Miltia with Dhatilos armies.

Upon hearing the news, Vorg immediately returned to Miltia, but the kingdom has been destroyed.

After 7 years, a dark shadow went into the royal room inside the Silverna castle. That dark shadow was Satan, Ifter.

Vorg heads to Silverna castle with his Helos. Satan owns the Sol Divide which is the pair of heilos.

The tale of magic, sword, and vengeance starts now!!

Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Moon, and Sun. These four magic stones and the gods of the moon and sun brought prosperity in Megalith. Because of that, the people lived a peaceful and prosperous life.

However, their peaceful life ended when Nebiros and his armies appeared.

A long time ago, during the war of the gods when the world was created, Nebiros was defeated by the gods of the sun and moon. He was locked up by the 4 magic stones but was freed by summoning a country which aims to achieve victory in the war using him.

Nebirus, as an act of revenge, controlled the mind of the god of the moon using his dark power. The god of the universe transformed people's form and spirit into hideous ones and made them as his armies. And the entire Megalith fell into the abyss of destruction and chaos.

Nebirus' army has started to move towards the god of the sun. The god of the sun, who was threatened by Nebirus' move, entrusted the weapons of the gods to 4 dragon knights and ordered them to overthrow Nebirus.

Uncover the chilling mysteries of this RPG-investigation game, descending deep into a world of cosmic horrors, creeping madness, and shrouded Old Gods within Lovecraft's iconic universe.

The Cthulhu Mythos has been fascinating audiences for generations, growing to become one of the largest shared universes ever envisioned and giving birth to countless stories, novels, movies, tabletop and videogames since the original publication of H.P. Lovecraft's The Call of Cthulhu. Adaptions and references have formed a widespread legacy stretching back to the very beginning of the 20th century, latching on to the key fear of the human psyche: that of the unknown. Now, Call of Cthulhu will bring the mythos to life like never before, on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.

In this world, nothing is as it seems. Sanity is an irregular bedfellow, all too often replaced by the whisperings in the dark. Strange creatures, weird science, and shadowy cults dominate the Cthulhu Mythos, intent on realizing their mad schemes to bring about the end of everything. Your mind will suffer -- balancing a razor-thin line between sanity and madness, your senses will be disrupted until you question the reality of everything around you. Trust no one. Creeping shadows hide lurking figures... and all the while, the Great Dreamer prepares for his awakening.

Lost in transit while on a colonist ship bound for the furthest edge of the galaxy, you awake decades later only to find yourself in the midst of a deep conspiracy threatening to destroy the Halcyon colony. As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable.

Key Features:

* The player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.
* You can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.
* Lead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.
* Explore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony's two planets didn't exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon.

Want to play on console whilst sitting on the sofa? Sure. Fancy a quick game on handheld whilst on the bus? Go ahead.

The King's Bounty turn-based tactics series returns with King’s Bounty II! Immerse yourself in the fantasy world of Antara!

Offering a fresh take on the acclaimed fantasy series, King’s Bounty II expands upon its tactical turn-based battles to offer players a truly immersive RPG experience that adds weight to their every decision, whether leading an army into battle against unliving horrors, or building relations with local townsfolk. Experience a rich world that blends realism and fantasy, filled with compelling stories, memorable characters and moral choices aplenty!

Taking on the mantle of one of three heroes – each with their own unique story – players embark on a non-linear, open-world adventure across a detailed and densely-packed fantasy landscape. Split into two distinct phases, players traverse the realm from a third-person perspective, picking up quests, exploring the wilderness, and getting to know the people they meet. When conflict arises, however, the perspective shifts to tactical, turn-based combat. Players must then make smart use of their units as they fight to win.

Set in the vast realms of Antara, a great danger has arisen. A mysterious blight has descended upon its furthest reaches, corrupting the land and all who live there. Refugees from the affected regions have begun arriving in the kingdom of Nostria, putting food and resources in short supply. Once living souls, blight-distorted creatures now roam the countryside leaving chaos and destruction in their wake. The land itself fights for survival, giving your decisions greater weight than ever before. How will you forge Antara’s future?

The cult classic RPG featuring team versus team battles finally arrives on Nintendo Switch!

Last released in 2008, The Last Remnant captured the hearts and minds of gamers with its enthralling story, countless characters and intricate battle system. Now this cult classic RPG is back with a Remastered version and is coming to Nintendo Switch with even more beautiful graphics, enhanced via an updated game engine.

There exists a world woven together by four races: Mitra, Yama, Qsiti, and Sovani.

In this world, mysterious objects called ""Remnants"" have existed since ancient times. Who created these objects? When? And for what reason? No one knew nor had the means to know, but continued to extract and use their colossal power.

However, the Remnants' immense power gradually caused the world to fall out of balance. As further separation tore apart those who rule and those who follow, a war broke outthe beginning of a long and endless strife.

A thousand years later, this story begins.

Distinct Battle System

A command-style battle with ever-changing scenarios

Coming in contact with enemies on the field will trigger battles. Strategize and make full use of the commands that change constantly depending on the positions and state of friendly and enemy forces.

Morale of friendly forces greatly affects the outcome of battle

In battle, morale expresses the spirit of individuals and groups of both friendly and enemy forces. Higher morale has advantageous effects such as increasing the attack stat to deal more damage, or decreasing damage dealt by the enemy Collapse",62.0,mixed or average reviews,9.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,7.1,mixed or average reviews,50.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,"Role-Playing, Japanese-Style",No Online Multiplayer,M,#89 Most Shared Switch Game of 2019

Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught, tortured and killed.

Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey.

The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play.

Key Features:

* Survive Together Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground?

* Where Am I? - Each level is procedurally generated, so youll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play.

* A Feast for Killers - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killers unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims.

* Deeper and Deeper - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer.

* Real People, Real Fear - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how its going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover whats hiding in the fog.

'Summer in Mara' is a summer adventure with easy-RPG elements and farming, crafting, and exploring mechanics set in a tropical archipelago.

'Summer in Mara' is a single player experience in a calm, relaxing environment, with a handmade look and a interesting narrative. You will be Koa, a little adventurer who wants to explore the world that surrounds her.

In 'Summer in Mara' you'll have to take care of your own island, harvest your crops, create new tools and buildings, and sail with your boat to discover new islands and secrets.
KEY FEATURES
- 'Summer in Mara' is an adventure and farming game, with an archipelago full of islands and secrets to explore.

- Day and night cycle with climate events.

- More than 100 quests to make the world a better place.

- More than 130 inventory items to make, use and trade.

- Unlock and acquire new abilities and skills for Koa, helping her to craft, trade and explore in an easy-RPG system.

You'll have your own island, but taking care of something like that is a lot of hard work. You'll be able to plant trees to get wood and craft new tools and buildings with it. Or create crop fields to grow all kinds of vegetables. You'll also have a farm with chickens and pigs to take care of. But be careful, because this isn't as easy as it looks! You'll also be able to fish in a pond on the island, cut trees with your hatchet, build things with your hammer and use a hoe to help you harvest your island.

Koa will need your help. With an easy-RPG system, she can acquire new abilities and grow stronger. We want you to feel like you're growing up with Koa, bonding with her and with all the other people in the archipelago.

You'll be able to sail to new islands and find treasures and other secrets in the middle of the sea with your trusty boat which you can upgrade with a little effort and time.
With new islands comes new people. You'll talk and trade with over twenty characters, each one with their own story and lifes. They'll give you quests, hints about the world or just anecdotes about their life and travels. Getting to know them is a very important part in the game, so we put much effort in making them unique and interesting.

But not all of the people you find will be friendly. An evil corporation called Elite wants to conquer Mara and exploit the ocean. Napopo is one of their first victims, a strange creature that will seek Koa for help.

Inspired by classic action movies, The Hong Kong Massacre places you at the center of a hard-boiled revenge story, filled with brutal, cinematic shootouts and vivid underworld locations.

Take on the role of a former police detective bent on exacting vengeance for his partner's murder and use of a mixture of raw firepower, slow-motion, and dive/dodge mechanics to tear your way through the criminal ranks.

Hunt down monsters to cook and eat them!

You’ve been revived in a massive underground complex and you must leave this bizarre facility. Aided by the undead Necro-Chef Simmer, you must stay safe, get fed, find a way to get out.

Dungeon Munchies is a side-scrolling action RPG with a focus on hunting down creatures, cooking them, and eating dishes to gain certain abilities. The combination of dishes you choose to eat will impact your entire play style.

Big Menu for a Big Stomach
With a stomach that can only take seven dishes, you must put together a meal that maximises your abilities. Guava juice, grilled shrimp, or crab stirfry may mean the difference between health recovery, damage output or a watery shield.

Tools of the Trade
Craft all kinds of deadly weapons out of the animal and plant parts you can't eat. Pair them with your favorite dishes to create the most overpowered combat combo.

Farm-fresh & Locally-sourced
In this day and age, ingredients are hard to come by. You should be prepared to face off electrical snails, razor-sharp shrimp claws, and laser wasps to get the delicious parts you need.

Something Doesn’t Feel Right...
From the self-professed-AAA-license-holding necro-chef, to the diabolical voodoo “Lord of the Forest”, to the radical revolutionaries of the fruit revolution, everyone wants you to do their thing, but no one's really right in the head. What’s really happening down in this dungeon?
