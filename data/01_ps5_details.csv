Lemnis Gate twists time to subvert one of the world’s most popular game genres and offers a relentlessly inventive multiplayer experience deeply rooted in tactical FPS gameplay. Challenge yourself to think across four dimensions as you embark on the ultimate test of cognition and combat.

Matches in Lemnis Gate take place within time loops. You have 25 seconds to execute your action, be it blasting an enemy, manoeuvring your operative, or setting up your next move. After all players have taken turns, the next 25-second round begins. Now you’ll face what has happened while setting up what will happen. Each of the five rounds is your chance to alter the timeline as past, present, and future converge.

STRATEGIC COMBAT IN THE FOURTH DIMENSION
Victory doesn’t rely on shooting supremacy. You’ll have to use skill and strategy to create unstoppable game plans and get the drop on opponents. It’s all about non-linear logic, abstract thinking, and outlandish manoeuvres. Execute audacious acts and think several moves ahead to get the win.

A TIME-BENDING TACTICAL SHOOTER
With a varied cast of characters to choose from, how you play is up to you. Lay damaging toxic waste in your enemy’s path, slow time to land the perfect shot, or deploy protective orbs to assist your future self. Every operative possesses a distinctive loadout and special ability that proves decisive on the battlefield.

Predict hostiles’ routes, infiltrate enemy lines, and develop multi-layered gameplans by co-operating with yourself. Experiment both in and outside time, and get creative with causality.

Reimagined gameplay creates fundamental advances that you’ll feel across every mode in FIFA 22. A goalkeeper rewrite brings more composure and consistency to the most important position on the pitch, new ball physics reimagine every pass, shot, and goal, and explosive sprint lets you feel the acceleration of the game’s quickest players.
• Goalkeeper Rewrite - A brand new goalkeeper system brings a new level of intelligence to the last line of defence, unlocking more reliable shot-stopping and smarter decision-making between the posts. In FIFA 22, goalkeeper positioning personality replicates the different styles of keepers throughout the game - from the lightning-fast reflexes of world-class shot stoppers like Jan Oblak to the aggression of sweeper keepers such as Ederson.
• True Ball Physics - Real-world data imported into FIFA 22 takes the game’s ball physics to a new level of realism. Tuned parameters including speed, swerve, air drag, air resistance, ground friction, and rolling friction mean every touch, trap, shot, volley, pass, and dribble will look, move, and fly like the real thing.
• Explosive Sprint - A new gameplay mechanic that changes the dynamic of one-on-one situations, Explosive Sprint gives you more control over acceleration when dribbling or defending. Lure opponents in and choose when to unleash your full speed to get away from the defender as you drive your team forward in attack.

It is the year 518. The rebellion of the renegade mages, known as the Mage Wars, has been quashed by the Crown. However, it was a Pyrrhic victory: Whole regions have fallen into anarchy, refugees roam the lands in search of shelter, and a mysterious, deadly plague called the “Bloodburn” has arisen and is spreading rapidly.

Abe has undergone an unwanted transformation from being a clueless Mudokon cog, literally about to be chewed up by the Glukkons' big business machine, into an unlikely hero, a beacon of hope.
Abe was someone who went about his life, blind to what was happening around him, and then woke to a deeper uncomfortable reality and had no choice but to make a change. Abe may not have wanted to be a hero, but there was, and remains, some greatness in Abe. A greater purpose. A greater good. All of which got him into enormous amounts of trouble and continues to do so.
Revolutions start small and build from unexpected places. You and Abe are the beginning. In Oddworld: Soulstorm, you will begin to understand the power of many will be needed to solve problems that the individual alone cannot.
Based on the concept of Scavenger's Economy, you will loot from trash cans, pickpocket, and search through lockers for items to craft into weapons and tools to use to help save your fellow Mudokons while you try to unlock the dark secrets behind Brew.

Whether you prefer the classic Abe playstyle of sneaking and problem solving or using scavenge for what you need to create an arsenal that you can hand off to your followers that you have saved along the way, Oddworld: Soulstorm gives you more choices to replay with different approaches.

Our ambition was to recreate the perfect soccer environment, from the grass on the field, to the players' movement, all the way to the crowds in the stadium. To this end, we decided to create a new soccer engine with a newly built animation system and revamped game commands.
The final result was even more impressive than we had originally conceived.
We went beyond the border of PES, into a new realm of virtual soccer.
To signal this new era, we have decided to part ways with our beloved PES brand and rename it ""eFootball™""!
