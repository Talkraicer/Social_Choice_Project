elden-ring,"Elden Ring is FromSoftware taming the monster they created, not by filing down its teeth and claws, but by giving players the weapons and armor to endure it.","Elden Ring is a stunning achievement from a literal video game architecture perspective, along with creating a difficult but not wildly punishing game that everyone, even non-Soulsborne devotees, should be able to enjoy. I have not been this impressed with an open world since Skyrim, and Elden Ring even surpasses that in many ways. It’s an easy game to recommend to anyone and everyone, and deserves the explosive sales success we’ve seen, dwarfing old FromSoft records. Elden Ring is a gaming achievement the likes of which we rarely seen, and you will be remiss to not pick it up and see what the hype is about for yourself.","More than anything, we must always stress that, yes, the Lands Between — the open world, therefore — is the main highlight. In an era taken by mediocre open-world games, it's refreshing to see that a company new to this concept got it so precisely right. There's no doubt about it: this is, indeed, one of the best games of recent years. If you're a fan of Open Worlds, no matter what level of challenge you're used to, give it a go. The chances of regret are almost zero. We often think of FromSoftware games in extreme ways. I love it. I hate it. It's amazing. It's unbearable. Elden Ring does bump into these dualities, but tends to be much more attractive to the public in general.","Not for the first time, a Miyazaki game has arrived and the landscape appears transformed. As you play, there is a sense of plates shifting beneath you, of the T&Cs of game development being hastily rewritten. We haven’t felt this way since “Breath of the Wild.” Here, as there, an open world means freedom and fresh air. [Issue#370, p.96]",Whether Elden Ring is perfect is beside the point. What matters is that it’s the ultimate expression of a blueprint first laid out in Dark Souls. It’s made my favorite game of all time feel like a practice run.,"Elden Ring is a game with a breathtaking universe, with crazy ambition. The effective gameplay coupled with the immense pleasure of exploration that is always rewarded are matched only by the fierce requirements of the game. More accessible than other FS productions, it offers the opportunity to discover a world of crazy elegance, with an artistic direction that is quite simply masterful. A generous world we no longer want to leave. An absolute masterpiece.","Solid gameplay, over the top world design, terrifying boss fights, eye catching visuals, deep combat mechanisms, endless possibilities, and many, many other things can be said about Elden Ring, but non of them can truly describe it for what it is. Elden Ring is out of this world, and you will have to play it.","Never before has such detail and passion been offered to the open world genre. Elden Ring is a masterclass of game design. From the massive, dense open world to the like-clockwork dance of combat, the amazing character design and seemingly unlimited gameplay choices. Each element of the game has been carefully crafted with love and purpose, making every little or large moment something worth discovering. Elden Ring is truly something special and this is going to be an incredibly tough act to follow for any open world game that comes after.","I just wrote a 2800+ word review about a game that left me speechless. I cannot describe how smart, fun, surprising, engaging, challenging, rewarding and addicting Elden Ring is. This is not just another game - it's FromSoftware's Magnum Opus.","Elden Ring is a masterclass in world design. It improves almost all of the bases of FromSoftware’s previous titles and adds upon them many new ones, with its verticality, astonishing world and great combat and story. It is a penultimate soulslike title, and one that will be surely played and remembered for years to come, putting a high bar for action RPGs and firmly sitting as one of the best video games ever.","Here, exploration is everything. Elden Ring is an RPG but one which elevates role playing to the point of vérité. You are as much the stranger in a strange land as your avatar; basic controls and some mechanics are explained in what passes for the game's tutorial, but that’s about it. There’s no quest log, no icon-studded mini-map, no on-screen overlays or bread crumb trail telling you what to do next, or even where to go. Everything else must be learned, either decoded from oblique item descriptions in-game or gleaned from invaluable internet communities. Death is not so much a setback to be avoided as a necessary staging post on the path to enlightenment. It may sound daunting in theory but in practice it’s exhilarating. Every inch of progress in Elden Ring feels earned, and is thus infinitely more rewarding for it.","It’s all terrifically done, especially when coupled with the story, which is full of mystery and plenty interesting. Elden Ring gets the little things right, too; the music that backs your journey is some of the best (and most well-utilized) in gaming. And every enemy feels distinct; you’ll face plenty of soldier-types, but the dragons and wildlife and the giant ogre-types that pepper certain lands inspire plenty of awe.","Elden Ring took the best parts of previous FromSoftware games and expanded them across a living open-world with endless discovery, excitement, and danger. It's not lost the edge of previous titles, but it is the most approachable FromSoftware game yet, and is an excellent point for players to jump in on if they've not tried previous titles. While its technical issues can be annoying, even they can't dampen the experience of playing Elden Ring. FromSoftware's latest is an artistic, innovative and cultural achievement like nothing before it.","Elden Ring packs its intricately crafted world - a world which should be used as a reference point for open-world design moving forward - with more impressive boss fights and secrets than you can shake a giant greatsword at. Although its punishing combat system may not be to everyone’s taste, it is an essential experience both for FromSoftware newcomers and seasoned veterans alike.",Elden Ring sets a new standard in Open world games and it takes us to new horizons that has us excited for the future of Souls games.,"Elden Ring is a superlative title, one of those works capable of becoming an event and becoming engraved in the collective imagination. It achieves this by remaining faithful to its formula and exporting its identity to the concept of the open world, achieving its own personal approach, resulting in a world that is visually stunning, and that works with overwhelming precision in terms of mechanics. An excellent videogame that also maintains the concreteness of its proposal.","A series so influential it becomes its own genre. That alone is FromSoft’s crowning achievement. For Elden Ring, the most recent iteration of that series, all superlatives fall short. This game is a timeless masterpiece that will go down in history as a milestone, not only for the genre and developer From Software, but for gaming as a whole.",An extraordinary milestone that will likely cast as long of a shadow over other open world games as Dark Souls already did over most action RPGs during the last decade.,"While boasting an overwhelming amount of content, not once did the world of Elden Ring feel tedious. The game’s level design is simply astounding and its map is filled not with chores but with a magnificent sense of adventure. While the fundamentals of the battle mechanics are borrowed from Dark Souls, the speedier flow of action and additional freedom in customization of equipment, items and magic allow you to fight your own way. The story is more dramatic and easier to follow than in previous FromSoftware titles. This and many more features make Elden Ring a marvel of a game that could become a serious threat to the balance of your daily life.","It’s lore always feels epic, but is ultimately hardcore fantasy nonsense and what’s going to keep you in Elden Ring for the long run is the amount to discover and the versatility and challenge at every turn. It has been equal parts a pleasure and hell to play Elden Ring. Because this is an amazing game and the developers have built a mind-boggling but nightmarish world to live and fight in. But it’s also one incredibly tough cookie from the off, and - casual gamers beware - you’ll have a lot of frustrating setbacks as you slowly progress as a warrior. Another wonderful video game for 2022. It’s already becoming a top year for consoles.","Elden Ring is not only the best game FromSoftware has released to date, but it's also one of the best open world games I've enjoyed in recent years. We are facing a title that manages to perfectly mix each of its elements, and the results really could not be better.","I’ve absolutely enjoyed my time with Elden Ring, and while I’d say my expectations were high prior to playing the game, those expectations have certainly been met or even exceeded along my journey. It feels like a culmination of everything FromSoftware has accomplished in the genre so far, offering up a robust world with tons of exploration married to the unique combat we’ve come to expect from their previous titles. I can’t necessarily say that there’s enough changes here that will appeal to people who have bounced off of Souls games previously, but it’s such a great looking (and playing) game that I think if you enjoy action-RPG’s in the slightest that it’s still worth a shot. And of course if you’re already a FromSoftware fan, then I’d imagine you’re already on board, and I can safely say that you won’t be disappointed.","However, when judged on its own merits, Elden Ring is a phenomenal game that will disappoint very few. It has most of the components that fans of the genre seek: a wondrous aesthetic, a feeling of mystery that invites exploration, skillfully designed and intimidating adversaries, and rich gameplay with a lot of replayability thanks to the various classes and builds. In the end, Elden Ring is more than just an open-world Dark Souls. It is strong in its own right, with tweaks to the classic Souls blueprint that create a refreshing new experience that still feels familiar.","Elden Ring is a masterpiece. From its expertly crafted open-world design that rewards the player for taking the chance to explore to its riveting lore, FromSoftware has delivered what can only be described as a deliberate and thoughtful experience. While some of its visual stylings are starting to show its age already, Elden Ring’s gameplay is the result of years of fine-tuning to be as rewarding as it is challenging. Many wondered if FromSoftware could put the level of detail into an open world that they have with their previous games. They’ve achieved that, and so much more.","FromSoftware doesn’t rewrite the medium’s rulebook, but does tear its own tenets asunder while reconstructing them into a cohesive whole that outclasses all that came before it. The Lands Between invites you to explore it with an unparalleled level of freedom, offering up a plate of seemingly impenetrable challenges and intimately constructed stories that are always a delight to indulge in. This is, without doubt, one of the best games in recent memory.","Elden Ring is both a refinement and evolution of the Dark Souls formula, presenting an expansive world that's as hostile as it is inviting. Despite the occasional excess, suffering has never been as much fun as this.","With Elden Ring, we're in masterpiece territory. FromSoftware is consistently great, of course, and I don't mean to denigrate Sekiro or Dark Souls here, as they're all exceptional, but Elden Ring has all the potential to have a similar level of impact as Demon's Souls here. Spinning a richly evocative and carefully paced tale of darkness and misery, Elden Ring isn't the most easygoing game, either in terms of its storytelling or general difficulty. However, not only is it majestic in scope and vision, it is one of the most perfect examples of how an open world structure can be used to the thematic benefit of the game, rather than just be a massive space used to hurl worthless content at players. In this way, Elden Ring joins a very elite group indeed... and is has arguably topped it.","Elden Ring is exactly what fans want it to be, and it very likely will become many people's favorite FromSoftware title yet.","Elden Ring is the embodiment of From Software’s best work yet. Top-notch quality of another huge soulslike adventure persists, especially in the cryptically epic story co-written by George R. R. Martin and in the ingeniously vast and visually stunning world of Lands Between that sets the new standard for open world games. And of course, you can expect a lot of dying, rolling, and rage-quitting. Elden Ring is a must play for every fan, but it also makes so many good steps towards accessibility for a greater audience.",Elden Ring is a fantastic game that can still deliver the unmatched thrill of defeating a tough boss after an hours-long battle. Those who worship at the church of Souls-like will find a game that’s basically everything they ever wanted.,"Elden Ring is the real next step for souls-like standards. It is unlike anything FromSoftware has created before, displaying an uncanny world that will keep on wowing players even as they pile up more and more hours of gameplay. Elden Ring is, thus, a prime candidate to become the 2022 GOTY.","Elden Ring is a crowning achievement of over a decade of Miyazaki’s and FromSoftware’s work, and an amazing example of how to find a whole new level of fun in a well-known and somewhat worn-out formula. The open world turned out to be a perfect fit for the genre and you can still tell this masterpiece was created by the famous Japanese studio. I honestly haven’t been so excited about a game since the first Dark Souls.","An uncompromising vision of wonder and terror, Elden Ring is the ultimate dark fantasy odyssey.","As an experience, it's one of the most wondrous and open-ended games I've played in years.","Elden Ring is a tour de force and is maybe the only example of a studio underselling a title. It's an M-rated Breath of the Wild, full of secrets, intrigue, and an enthralling world to explore. It's a game that makes me excited about gaming, and it's fantastic to see a highly anticipated title like this turn out so well.",Elden Ring is the true triumph that FromSoftware was striving for all those years. Complete and utter triumph.,"Elden Ring is the culmination of everything Dark Souls brought before it, mixed with a fresh take on the open world genre that leaves no hand held with minimal boring sequences or clogged quest logs. Despite a few growing pains and the real fun beginning a few hours in, Elden Ring is what every game in its genre should strive to be; a challenging, mysterious adventure that never ceases to amaze, only getting better the more time you spend in its dark, yet absolutely beautiful world.","I'm joyfully exploring every inch of the land and delighting in my discoveries, and I don't see myself stopping any time soon.","Elden Ring is an exceptional, accomplished work that realises a fantasy world of solemnity, beauty, and menacing uncertainty you can’t help but lose yourself in.","Combining the deep and challenging combat FromSoftware is known for with a vast and varied world that's always a pleasure to explore, Elden Ring is quite simply incredible. From the moment you step foot into The Lands Between you'll be engrossed, and while you'll no doubt experience some setbacks on your adventure – such as a boss that at first seems impossible to defeat – there's always somewhere else to go to cool off, pick yourself up, and perhaps power yourself up before returning to have another go. That is to say, you don't just play Elden Ring; you live in its world for hours at a time. It will consume you, but you'll willingly throw yourself into its maw with fervour.","FromSoftware effortlessly immerses you into the beautiful world of The Lands Between, with challenging enemies, secret treasures, and deep lore tucked away into every corner. This is, without a doubt, FromSoftware's best project yet, showcasing a culmination of all their previous games.","Elden Ring is a constantly surprising adventure that has taken FromSoftware’s tried-and-tested formula to delirious new heights. One of the best video games of the last decade, and an absolutely essential release, Elden Ring really does confirm that 2022 is off to an incredible start.","Deep, wide, and absolutely packed with adventure, Elden Ring's immense, deadly open world is nothing short of game-changing.",An unrivalled feat of design and inventiveness.,"FromSoftware has delivered a masterpiece with Elden Ring. The developer has put every lesson they've learned in the past into the game and perfected every gameplay-element. Add to that an enormous and diverse open world, the ability to travel and fight on horseback and the fact that Elden Ring is still challenging, while being more welcoming to new players. It's an epic adventure that not a single gamer should miss out on.","Instead of a new IP, Elden Ring feels like a swan song; the culmination of 13 years refining a genre. All the ideas and lessons of FromSoftware latest works converge inside the biggest, richest and exquisitely designed open world we've ever set foot on. It honestly feels like a game that won't be surpassed for years.","Elden Ring is an awe-inspiring achievement. Both a summary and bold step forward, it fuses FromSoftware's best and most effective ideas with an endlessly engaging open world. Its combat is the most refined of the series, challenging yet accessible to new players. Elden Ring includes an incredible amount of quality content. More importantly, it offers a captivating, polished experience fraught with danger and filled with beauty.","Elden Ring has, from now on, a place of honor in the pantheon of the best video games in history. From Software needed 13 years to refine to the last detail its vision of a genre that has influenced the industry like few studios before and give us a totally overwhelming title both for its content and for the sense that has every last object and pixel of the Lands Between.",A must play for action-RPG fans looking for deep combat systems and an expansive open-world that truly rewards exploration.,"With Elden Ring, From Software establishes an ideal model in open world game design. Neither too empty nor artificially crowded, with each adventure bringing a significant reward, albeit proportionate to the intensity of the challenge. The game sets a new paradigm for the genre, as it strikes a perfect balance by rewarding the player for each task accomplished, exploration well performed, or each battle won. The journey is massive, full of content and with minimal repetition. Elden Ring delivers extensive customization and an even more enhanced combat system than its spiritual predecessors. This aspect, added to the online component, will surely ensure a healthy community for years to come. It is unfortunate that performance issues exist, but such a factor should not be an impediment for the community to enjoy such a special game.","Elden Ring delivers what it promises: it's a souls-like fantasy action RPG game developed by FromSoftware, with the influence of Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin, that brings a sprawling realm fully immersed in a rich and bloody story and that certainly will have every fan of fantasy and challenge ready to immerse themselves in this universe for hours and hours. Get ready for lots of action, epic battles, adventure, exploration and hardship.","All things considered, Elden Ring is a crowning achievement for FromSoftware but also for gaming. It takes the overused open world formula and flips it with a focus on exploration and freedom. It eliminates those limiting markers and quest objectives which every game since The Witcher 3 has used and that have really dampened the open world formula. For a game all about tradition, with its fantasy aesthetic and kings or rulers, it is amazing that Elden Ring breaks the mold and tradition by making such a compelling and intriguing experience. Once the bugs have been ironed out, there is no doubt in my mind that Elden Ring will be looked upon as one of the best games ever created despite the difficulty. It will be looked upon as a genre defining classic.","Elden Ring is a true soulslike that does some wonderful things with the concept of an open world, and its hands-off exploration. I haven't had so much fun with an open world since Red Dead Redemption 2. A difficult, satisfying, and otherwise excellent game!","Elden Ring is the culmination of all the Souls entries up to this point, creating a near perfect gameplay experience filled to the brim with incredible boss fights, gorgeous graphics, and an insanely large world to explore. A variety of new ideas, including crafting and the addition of the spirit horse Torrent, help bring a new level of immersion to the proceedings while simultaneously helping Elden Ring feel like a unique entry in the Souls genre. With gameplay tailored for players who want to experience the world solo as well as those who wish to play nearly the entire game in co-op, Elden Ring is a masterclass in design. Minor gripes about a couple of boss fights and the sheer density of the world to explore leaving many areas potentially undiscovered aside, Elden Ring is a nearly flawless experience which old and new fans of the Souls series will enjoy.","Elden Ring is exactly the game people were hoping it would be. It's the biggest FromSoft Soulslike to date, with a ton of polish and a bucketload of content. It won't change your mind if you don't enjoy the genre, but Elden Ring accomplishes what it had set out to do. Not every new feature hits, and it sometimes felt a touch too familiar, but when the biggest complaint I can think of is, ""It feels like some of the best games ever made,"" that is a sign of its quality. Elden Ring is the game we've all been waiting for.","Elden Ring borrows a lot from Dark Souls and a bit from Bloodborne and Sekiro. With the blueprints of those games in their hands, FromSoftware started building and building. The result is a hugely good open world game that leaves an unforgettable impression in both scale and detail, but also scares.","Elden Ring feels like the natural evolution of a video game series that continues to reinvent itself after more than 13 years of its birth. FromSoftware is simply the best at what they do. While there are some technical issues and repetitive structures and creatures, Elden Ring is a cruelly wonderful piece of work and one of the best adventure games of recent years.","While it feels like the impact of Breath of the Wild is waning as the open world genre starts to stagnate again, Elden Ring stands out as not only an achievement in FromSoftware’s hall of fame, but also as an open-world RPG. Elden Ring is without a doubt, FromSoft’s most ambitious undertaking yet, and like Dark Souls before it, I believe it will leave a permanent mark on both the open-world genre and the games industry in general.","Elden Ring is the next evolution of the “Souls” genre. It feels both familiar and truly unique. Fans of previous “Souls” games will feel right at home, while appreciating the new features, mechanics and quality of life improvements the game has to offer.",FromSoftware surpass themselves and create a magnificent action masterpiece that is unique in terms of open world design.,"Although I still find the original Dark Souls to be FromSoftware's magnum opus, Elden Ring is an undeniably amazing game. At the end of the day, it's sure to delight most Souls veterans but it probably won't convert many non-fans.","Elden Ring can be seen as the dawn of a new era on FromSoftware. The game is a really deep experience, with amazing visuals, an unique sense of freedom, and of course, the hard-fought battles that we all love to hate. A well-rounded RPG filled with challenges, many different places to explore and great mechanics. It's GOTY material.","Elden Ring is neither a step forward nor backward for the famed developer, but rather a shift to the side. It’s a different kind of FromSoftware game, one that mixes stampeding mounted combat in a vast world with more intimate, terrifying moments in dark caves and cramped castles. I’m having a grand time with it, make no mistake, but it’s not my favourite FromSoftware game to date.","Elden Ring is everything that I dreamed of and more. Although I did expect From Software to refine the Souls recipe, I was quite surprised by the large amount of new mechanics and how well the Souls formula has been implemented in an open-world environment. But it’s not just the exploration aspect that makes Elden Ring the best Souls game out there. The massive open-world that doesn’t feel empty at all, the huge number of bosses and dungeons, as well as the boss fights elevate it to an entirely new level. Elden Ring is From Software at its best.",A must have action-RPG with deep combat systems and an very interesting open-world. Sadly all is not perfect and graphics are totally outdated and AI have some problems.,"Despite all of us playing the same game, what we experience in Elden Ring will be unique to each of us, and that is where the crux of its power lies. It is these differing experiences and its powerful emphasis on discovery that make Elden Ring a game that is worth discovering for yourself. Many will appreciate it, few will master it, but all will acknowledge it as a distinctive adventure that is as rewarding as it is dangerous.","FromSoftware is back with Elden Ring and although we had to wait a long time, it was worth it. The new approach with an open world works particularly well and that is partly due to the strong gameplay and beautiful environments that excel especially in style. In addition, the many bosses are incredibly cool and the soundtrack is fantastic. A must have, but know that the PS5 version has to contend with frame rate issues.","Sure, the new From Software title still operates like a typical Souls game insofar as it thrusts you into a mysterious world filled with beguiling monstrosities to kill. But enough tweaks have been made to create an experience that is, dare I say it, somewhat comforting.","Elden Ring is the definitive FromSoftware game. With a refined combat system packing new ideas and an open world perfect for exploration, it sets a new benchmark for titles of this ilk to strive for. This is the Japanese developer firing on all cylinders — far and away its best creation yet. Elden Ring is an utterly essential PS5 title.","Elden Ring is a very entertaining game that takes a lot from other FromSoftware titles. Its beautiful open world is a double-edged sword: on the one hand, it invites you to explore, but on the other, it makes you face the same enemies over and over again until you are sick of it.","The years of waiting were worth it, Elden Ring is brilliant. It offers a huge amount of content, a beautiful world and addictive gameplay. But the series does start to feel a little bit stale.","The massive open game world isn't the earth-shattering innovation we expected from FromSoftware, but thankfully the Dark Souls foundation it's built over is just as strong and addictive as we've come to expect from the studio. It's the seventh piece of evidence that no one really does boss fights and epics as well as Hidetaka Miyazaki.",A masterful blend of Dark Souls and Zelda: Breath Of The Wild that makes high demands of its players and yet still remains surprisingly accessible and adaptable.,"With its new open-world dimension, Elden Ring brilliantly fleshes out FromSoftware's already highly effective formula and offers Souls a spiritual sequel that is both ambitious and accessible. All the new features converge towards this last objective: the open world allows you to arm yourself more than ever with the epic and obligatory fights that the adventure reserves, without having the impression of walking around just to farm. And the best part is that it doesn't compromise the sense of accomplishment so important to the genre. Elden Ring is a complete, mysterious experience, where curiosity is tirelessly renewed by the feeling of discovering something for the first time. All with a sumptuous artistic direction, which makes you want to get lost, to explore. The title also welcomes new features that offer strategic choices in combat, without betraying their requirement. We only regret a slight lack of ambition for certain Legacy Dungeons, as well as the recycling of some assets and bosses. Overall, an exceptional title.",There are no other dynamics quite like it in games; they acquaint us with an array of miseries and charge us money for the privilege.,"This isn’t just Dark Souls with an open world tacked on. Instead, developer FromSoftware weaves its familiar formula into a massive playground so expertly that we can’t help but wonder how we ever played Dark Souls without it.","Elden Ring feels like the game FromSoftware has been building up to ever since Demon’s Souls released in 2009. A huge open world filled to the brim with challenging enemies, characters sporting obvious influence from George R. R. Martin, and the typical drip-feed of lore FromSoftware is famous for crafting all combine to form an intoxicating adventure you won’t soon forget. Yes, the formulaic nature of these games is absolutely showing after three console generations, but as the saying goes, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!","Make no mistake, Elden Ring is to the Souls subgenre what Breath of the Wild was to the Zelda franchise; it took a classic dungeon-diving formula and opened it up, adding more choice, nuance, and combat flexibility in the process. It feels destined to kickstart a wave of ""did you know you could do this?"" YouTube videos, and a deeper discussion of build-crafting. Elden Ring isn’t Dark Souls 4 or just ‘Big Souls’, but it’s damn close, and represents the evolution the series needed and manages to be everything else we wanted it to be.","An enormous world which is always entertaining, an artistic and narrative coherence so strong that it reminds of Lordran, a sheer amount of content that is seriously overwhelming, and a near perfect concept design, make Elden Ring the best result that is possible to achieve within the “soulsborne” formula, with all its traditional strengths and weaknesses.","Elden Ring is more than a mixture of Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Sekiro. Its huge game world invites you to explore, and there is much more optional than mandatory content. There are some minor balance issues, but they blench out considering all the strengths. In total, Elden Ring does not quite reach its predecessors on the eye level, but the game is still a need to play for any action rpg fan.","Elden Ring is an unrelenting, engrossing, challenging, and marvelous experience. It brings the Dark Souls formula to an open world setting without skipping a beat, with all of its cryptic nature, punishing combat and wondrous level design. It's still not for everyone, but those who dare enter this realm may find themselves in one of the best games of the year.","Translating 13 years of legacy into a gigantic open world was quite a big challenge, and FromSoftware did it brilliantly with Zelda Breath of the Wild as a guide. But, to be honest, we don't share the opinion of most of our colleagues: Elden Ring is an excellent title, but it still lacks something to have the stuff of a GOTY 2022.","Elden Ring's engaging combat, mythology and dynamite orchestral soundtrack goes a long way to overshadow an aggressive open world that punishes exploration from the beaten path. Fans of the Souls genre are in for a treat, while newcomers will need to persist to reap the benefits.","Elden Ring needed to be fresh and bold, and it succeeds, putting you in charge of your own adventure. However the open world has some uneven terrain. [Issue#12, p.80]","Elden Ring is one of those rare games that leads the industry by exemplifying with its open-world design and elaborate dungeon crawling, never-ending content that could fill several games. [Recommended]","After over 20 hours spent in this kind of explore-and-bounce-off-a-boss pattern, I still feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface of Elden Ring’s entrancing world (not to mention the many magical systems that aren’t really available to my character’s warrior class). I’m not sure I’ll ever have the patience or discipline to endure all of the punishing boss battles I still have ahead of me. But I can easily see myself just hopping on a horse, picking a direction, and galloping off into the many unexplored corners of Elden Ring.","Elden Ring remains a glorious game, one that established fans are going to savour for some time to come, and one that may just welcome new fans into the FromSoft fold. Sumptuous visual design, dark and detailed lore and a vast-but-intricate open world are reason enough to venture out into the Lands Between. Add to that FromSoftware's unforgiving and unforgettable gameplay loop and this is something truly special. [Eurogamer Essential]",The Jeffs and Jan convene and hold gnarled fingers together to chat about their harrowing adventures in the world of Elden Ring.,"Like most great works, Elden Ring is magnificently flawed, equal parts beautiful and ostentatious. In this age of cookie-cutter, paint-by-numbers, triple-A development, what more can you ask for than something wholly confident in its bullshit? Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m only about one-third of the way through the game and would love to see at least one of its multiple endings sometime this year.","Probably the easiest, most enticing way to describe the sheer scale of Elden Ring is to say it’s like receiving two to three new Dark Souls games in one.","Elden Ring is the natural next step for FromSoftware, which last delivered a huge fantasy world like this in Dark Souls 3. That game featured a sprawling, interconnected world, a vast armory, and an incredible amount to learn, wield, and discover. Elden Ring is that game amplified — it plucks the best from Bloodborne, with its compact, puzzle-like mini-dungeons, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which offered new levels of mobility and faster action. But, all told, FromSoftware has done more than just remix its earlier games and layer on open-world influence with Elden Ring. The studio’s conversation with the player goes in fascinating new directions, and there are great surprises here for longtime fans of Souls games; From clearly knows what we expect of its castles, its boss encounters, the random out-of-nowhere ambushes, and it plays with those expectations. Sometimes it means I die unexpectedly. And sometimes it makes me smile",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-witcher-3-wild-hunt---complete-edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Not everything is perfect in this current-gen upgrade, but the additions, new choices, and improvements make this version of the game feel complete. Despite the oddities that come with the new camera option, the presentation across the board just feels superb. It even lets those who missed the expansions jump right into that content from the jump. Such a great update to a beloved game comes free with the PS4 version, leaving this as almost a requirement for everyone who even remotely has an interest in playing it again or experiencing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt for the first time.",,,,,,,,,"There’s not much to give an opinion on here, as much of the change implemented is visual and quality of life. It’s a welcome update, and if it’s been a while since you’ve played or if you’ve just never gotten around to it, now is a great time to do so. The Witcher 3 has been in a good place for a while, but these upgrades further cement it in it’s spot as one of the all-time greats.","Few would argue that the original version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was a bad-looking game that was rough to play. In many ways, it's still among the best games in both departments. However, by simply including ray tracing, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Complete Edition is now a step above what it already was, and beyond that, the smaller improvements that CD Projekt Red has created in-house and in collaboration with the community all amount to this update being a significantly enhanced version of an already great game. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Complete Edition is worth revisiting for series veterans who eagerly await the next entry in the franchise or new players who want to see the game in its best light.","Judging The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Complete Edition on its entertainment value is easy – it’s perfect. It has an unbelievable story, compelling characters, solid gameplay, and a properly thought-through backend that shows the developers are all-in on delivering an unforgettable experience. On the next-generation upgrade side of this release, it’s just not complete. While the performance mode takes the experience up a notch with visuals and frame rate, the Ray Tracing mode is unplayable and incomplete. It hurts the experience more than it helps it.",,,,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition is a fantastic upgrade to the already-phenomenal original game. Since it's provided free of charge to people who already own it on PC, PS4, and Xbox One, there's no real excuse for those players not to revisit this all-time classic. And for those who have never played The Witcher 3 before, this is the perfect time to finally enjoy this incredible title.",,"While some cracks are beginning to form around the edges, the people who’ve played the game 10 times already won’t care, and will be thrilled to hear that the next-gen version of the game provides a definitive console experience and a great reason to head back out into the wilds.",,"Changes introduced by the update are not far-reaching or crucial, but such improvements as fast loading or more comfortable controls make the experience more enjoyable. Looking at character faces, animations, and some elements of gameplay design, it’s hard not to notice The Witcher 3 was released in 2015, but it plays great in 60 FPS, the Continent is beautiful like never before and it’s still the immensely fun game many people fell in love with.",,,,,,,,,"The core of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt remains unchanged, thank god. It's the same game we all fell in love with before. Playing on a PlayStation 5 and being able to play around with the new controls, including the haptic and adaptive triggers made playing as Geralt all the better. The new quick casting system works wonders for me, and if it doesn’t for you then you retain the old configuration. The framerate has been given a noticeable overhaul as well. I no longer chugged about when I ran while in a city full of objects. This is the perfect excuse to play The Witcher 3 again. The best part of the update is that it’s completely free; you can’t afford not to play again.",,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt next-gen update makes a great game even better, improving practically every element of the much loved game.",,,"The perfect example of how all next-gen upgrades should be: visual improvements everywhere, various graphical modes, gameplay and QOL changes, some new content... And most important of all: free. The Witcher 3 was already a masterpiece, but now it also looks terrific.","There is no question that the free update makes The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt a better game. It looks better, it controls better and the many, minor improvements add up to a significantly improved experience. The Netflix-based DLC is not a cheap tie-in but a well-made and completely integrated new chapter worth playing. Short of an actual remake, the update brings a seven-year-old game within spitting distance of the best current-gen title. The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt update breathes new, exciting life into a genuine classic.",,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt provides a next-gen facelift for this immersive role-playing game with its all DLC's and some of the best player mods!,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on PS5 is still the fantastic adventure that won over thousands of players in the last generation. It's basically one of the best games of all time improved in many points, such as loading, frame rate and graphics. The free upgrade just make things even better. However, don't expect anything new though - at its heart it's the same game we enjoyed in 2015 and its expansions later on.",,,"I don't know why anyone would wait all these years to check out The Witcher 3, but there won't be a better time to do it. The next-gen patch has some issues, but this is definitely the best way to experience The Wild Hunt on consoles.",,,,,,,,,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is even better now. And that’s all we need to say. What was already a great game now has a Performance Mode with 60fps, ray tracing, Photo Mode… CD Projekt Red did everything it could to make Geralt’s journey even more attractive, weather it’s to old fans or newcomers to the saga.",,,"The Witcher III was one of the biggest video games of 2015, it is now, thanks to this careful update for the latest consoles, one of the biggest of 2022, unabashedly thanks to the care given to these PS5, Xbox Series and PC versions.","CD Projekt Red’s free update overhauls the Witcher 3’s graphics, fine-tunes some familiar features, and offers you a nostalgic experience that feels new at times but just as good as you last left it.",,,"Over seven years after its original release, The Witcher 3 is still a masterpiece. In its character writing and dialogue, it's yet to be surpassed, while its knack for telling so many engrossing stories is still seriously impressive. Although aspects of its gameplay haven't aged quite so well, there's no doubt that Complete Edition is the best version of a truly outstanding open world adventure.",,,,"This is likely to be the definitive version of a great game, and an excellent excuse to dive back into its gloriously rich and varied world, but at the moment it’s a bug-ridden mess that’s more trouble to play than the seven-year-old original. We’re sure by next Christmas it’ll all be running perfectly but all you get this year is a lump of 4K coal. [Review in Progress]","The game has never looked so good on home consoles, whether in 4K Ray-Tracing or in 60 frames per second. If this update also offers nice game comfort options, the adventure remains similar to what we knew until then, for lack of new content. Despite the number of years, The Witcher 3 remains one of the essential titles of recent years, both in terms of role-playing, history or even open world. If you haven't experienced it yet and don't have a powerful PC, then this next-gen update is a great way to experience the world of the witcher Geralt of Rivia.",,,,,,"Due to raytracing and 3D-sound the next-gen-version of ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"" is a major improvement in comparison to the original. Additionally the DLCs and updates secure hours of enjoyment.",,,,,,,,,,,"Improved graphics, mods that make inventory management and map navigation a little easier, and some throw-in DLC are all good. But I’m not sure that they are the explosively exciting thing about returning to The Witcher 3 in 2022. These are elements that might lure you in for a replay or, if you’re lucky, your first foray into the interlocked worlds of commoners, creatures, immortals, and lords that Geralt weaves through. They’re what gets you in the door, maybe, but they’re not the party. The party — by which I mean the massive political and interplanar story that happens within The Witcher 3 — is still incredible, and still manages to make the vast majority of other open-world RPGs (most other games, really) seem lacking by comparison. [Polygon Recommends]","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Complete Edition takes a nearly-perfect game and makes it better. Nothing about this title really needed to be changed, which makes it even nicer that the developers took the extra effort to implement various quality-of-life improvements in addition to giving it a graphical facelift for the current console generation. Given its compelling story, fantastic dialogue writing and incredibly fun gameplay, it was arguably the best game released in 2015. This new update does nothing but improve upon a masterpiece. The improvements to graphics and gameplay are enough solidify Complete Edition as the definitive version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.","This free update delivers on all counts, with not only a substantive graphical upgrade but an entirely new quest that's worth the price of admission alone. If you've played before, we still recommend heading back. If you haven't, you're in for one of the best games of all time.",This is an unforgettable adventure that just got better. One of the best ARPG ever made improves on every front with a free upgrade for the ultimate experience.,"The upgraded edition takes what made the 2015 version so loved and throws it into the new generation with so much care that it feels like a different game while maintaining the backbone of the original. The improvements are executed flawlessly, and I can see myself pouring an additional 100 hours or more into this universe now that it can compare to other next-gen games.","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Complete Edition is as essential now as it was seven years ago. Whether you're looking to play the game for the first time or have been waiting for this free upgrade (and bonus quest) before revisiting, then this is the perfect time to start. It's a masterpiece and still stands at the top of its genre.","The Witcher 3 is commonly cited as one of the best video games ever made. While I would never have called it “perfect,” it was always close. This final release brings it even closer.","The upgrade of image performance, the improvement of settings, the adaptation of different platforms, and the excellent localization work. The next-generation version of ""The Witcher 3"" has made great progress after a series of updates. CDPR successfully turned this ""former masterpiece"" into a ""present masterpiece"", making it rejuvenate.","A welcome update, The Witcher 3 is just as magnificent and engrossing as it was seven years ago. It looks beautiful, but still retains that rusty charm that sometimes creeps into a game so massive. Given that it’s a free upgrade, there’s no better time to get back into the world of Geralt and the Wild Hunt.","I have played through The Witcher 3 multiple times, and clocked in several hundred hours into the game across different platforms- and yet, jumping back into its brutal world, I still find myself transfixed.","As someone who repeatedly had the Witcher series suggested by other reviewers and then digging in the heels and refusing to try it, what was missed was one of the best games created on a modern console. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt deserves all the plaudits it receives and in its new next gen update, there really is no better way to experience it. Although lacking in new content, the quality-of-life features and sheer beauty of the whole thing make this well worth a revisit.","Almost eight years later, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt manages to shine among its most direct competitors. This version takes a huge step towards the next-gen thanks to improved visuals, a ton of quality of life improvements and most importantly some of the best mods out there. There’s also a glimpse of new content, but the traditional game, the one dated back to 2015, is still the brightest diamond in the package.","The impact of the new textures and a revised lighting system in almost every part allows you to appreciate the adventures of the Witcher par excellence like never before, with a cinematic cut made even more effective by the addition of Ray Tracing and with unprecedented fluidity choosing to opt for the performance mode. Wisely selected the mods produced by the community, and equally effective those created from scratch to rejuvenate the most obsolete mechanics of the original game, which now benefits from a fresher and more dynamic interaction system and a close-up view that favors immersion in the exploration and combat.","The graphics sector does not magically become something-other than what it was, but the game performs well both in Ray-Tracing and in Performance, allowing you to experience the adventure to the fullest of the possibilities offered by today's technologies, without rebuilding it from scratch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
god-of-war-ragnarok,"There’s not a single quest, not a single action, that isn’t without a reason, a story to tell, wrongs to address, a sight to see, or a direct emotional through line to follow for at least one of our menagerie of travelers. Every new quest in the game enriches these characters or the world they inhabit, sometimes both.","God of War Ragnarok is a beautiful, moving game, no longer purely centered on a father getting to know his son, but also about vengeance, forgiveness and attempting to change both prophecy, and the people we used to be, both of which prove to be equally difficult. It’s almost impossible for me to imagine those who loved the last God of War will not also appreciate this one just as much, minus a lagging stretch here or there, and the fact that it can’t be as transformative as the initial leap from the Greek games.","God of War Ragnarok builds upon its predecessor achievements with a far more ambitious campaign. It's way more diverse visually and design-wise, while telling a compelling story about — ironically — very human themes. Absolutely, the best in the series and a must-play for all PlayStation fans.","The combat is beefy enough to carry you through the slower stretches, but even when you're lopping heads off dragons it can feel like what you're really killing is time. [Issue#379, p.100]",,"God of War Ragnarök is an absolute masterclass! Visually fantastically beautiful, it offers an adventure with a controlled, extremely generous, strong, human narration, with incredibly well-written characters, reversals of situations and dantesque fights with gameplay that is still just as nervous and even richer than that of the episode preceding it. The quality of Santa Monica's work is once again at the rendezvous with this pure video game masterpiece.","Every once in a while a game comes out that makes you appreciate being a gamer, and God of War Ragnarok is definitely one of those games. You will be surprised how every single moment of the game is thought through and how its world pulls you in. Santa Monica has reached a whole new level of maturity with the latest entry in the God of War series, and to go even beyond this level in the future is something that only a handful of studios might be capable of doing, and Santa Monica is one of them.",,"This is, without any doubt, one of biggest PlayStation games ever made. It's polished beyond belief, with great writing, voice acting, graphics and sound design. The combat and puzzles are, yet again, a subject of taste, but it did the job for me. If you loved God of War 2018, then this is a must buy for you.","It’s God of War 2018, only bigger, prettier, more detailed, more open, more complete and much more intense. It’s more of everything from the sequel that both revived and killed the old franchise at the same time. If you loved the new God of War, this game has nothing but means to blow you away this time around.","God of War: Ragnarok manages to wrangle the best of blockbuster gaming under its muscular control. Spectacle. Excitement. Empowerment. And, well, we all know how that feels, don’t we?",,"God of War: Ragnarok is the perfect sequel. A carefully iterative offering that beautifully maintains the essence of 2018's Game of the Year while making meaningful improvements to augment its already stellar combat and progression systems, God of War: Ragnarok is a meaty and deeply emotional epic that effortlessly secures its place as one of the best games on PS5 and a sure-fire Game of the Year candidate.","God of War Ragnarok is a clear GOTY contender, as the deserved sequel features an action-packed narrative, satisfying combat, a luscious Norse world, and some fantastic character development.","God of War Ragnarök is an impactful story about the complicated relationship between father and son in the face of unforeseen circumstances, and a rich adventure that is full of combat and discovery. Similarity with the first game doesn't stop it from being an excellent sequel.","God of War: Ragnarök, as a sequel, played with an advantage, and therefore had to overcome what was exposed by its predecessor. My impression is that it succeeds, and that is the best news that, I think, I could give you today.","God of War Ragnarök is bigger and grander than its predecessor in every way. More destinations, more enemies, vaster environments, more difficult puzzles and bigger stakes. Predecessor ‘God of War’, however, set the bar so immeasurably high for itself. 'Ragnarök' is a rock-solid game and highly recommended, only we're quietly getting used to sequels like this from Sony.","God of War Ragnarök is a clear example of how a sequel to a successful game should be approached: it is not just more and better, but it is also a title that does not shake its pulse when it comes to making weighty decisions (playable and narratives) and get most of them right. We are facing a work that offers more vertical and dynamic combat, with a much more choral development and a perfectly adjusted rhythm of events, which maintains the base that made it great in the past and adds surprises, epics, and exciting moments.","With gorgeous visuals and well-thought-out level design, God of War Ragnarok’s magnificent tale has the potential to reach out to many people. It utilizes next-gen hardware to the maximum to create an experience that only a videogame can offer.",It continues to plunder that wonderful rich vein they’ve been tapping of a brilliant single-player story combined with first-rate gameplay and graphics.,"God of War: Ragnarök is an unforgettable journey filled with epic and intimate moments that can range from slaying one of Asgard's gods, to how deep and complex the relationship between father and son is. Supporting all this, we have a brilliant action and adventure game that surpasses its predecessor in everything and that also teaches what are standards when we talk about a super production within the medium. Game of the Year Candidate? Of course, probably the only tangible and realistic rival to everything that Elden Ring achieved a few months ago. The closure of this new saga of Kratos is one that has achieved and far exceeded our expectations and that, of course, makes it a jewel of what Sony has achieved in recent years with its first party developments.","I came away from God of War: Ragnarök very impressed with what the team at Santa Monica Studio were able to put together, and I think you will be too. It’s a fantastic sequel to one of the better game releases on Sony hardware in the past decade, and delivers fully in every meaningful way, making this a true showcase game for current-gen hardware. It also doesn’t skimp out in the gameplay department, offering up lots of hours of enjoyment, while pacing itself out in a way that puts a lot of other open-world style games to shame, keeping you hooked throughout. I’d highly recommend checking out God of War: Ragnarök when it drops on November 9th, you will not be disappointed.","God of War Ragnarok is a once-in-a-generation game. It doesn't just live up to its high expectations, but it subverts them and expands beyond them all the same. There is nothing quite like it on PS4 or on the PS5 yet, and it would be hard for anything to live up to the same heights. God of War Ragnarok may not make full use of the PS5's features, as there is nothing necessarily groundbreaking that couldn't be experienced on a PS4, but it's absolute proof that vision, artistry, and creative direction far outweigh hardware.","Though not the same tectonic shift as its predecessor, God of War Ragnarök represents one of the finest pieces of interactive entertainment available. By expanding on all the ideas set forth in 2018, Ragnarök culminates in an emotional, enthralling finale for Kratos and Atreus.","From a gameplay perspective, I got more than I anticipated from Ragnarok. It manages to introduce new systems and gameplay mechanics consistently from beginning to end, keeping combat and exploration fresh and exciting the entire time - you can check out the most in-depth analysis of the combat here, in my preview, and in this non-exhaustive deep dive. Gear has similar progression problems that 2018’s God of War had, but now you can actually craft complex builds with cool synergies that feel impactful. There’s an unbelievable amount of variety in the places you go and the kinds of enemies you fight compared to the previous game, and your options in combat are a lot more involved and meaningful as well. These improvements and refinements make Ragnarok a great sequel, and the increased length will please the ‘time spent = value’ crowd, but the path from Faye’s final resting place to the final battle of Ragnarok is not nearly as composed or worthwhile as it could have been.","I found God of War Ragnarok an oddly split experience overall. There's a light start that feels padded – still good but missing depth – which leads into a weighty finish that's every bit the equal of its predecessor. But despite feeling like a 15 hour story trying to fill a 30 hour game, God of War Ragnarok is still easily one of the best PS5 games of the year. Even when it feels a bit thin, that's largely in comparison to the last game, with this maintaining that same absurd level of polish, and entertainment, even when the story feels like it's filling for time. When the dial does finally crank up to 11 you can feel it kick in, and by the end there are some incredible beats and a hugely satisfying resolution overall.","But I can’t help but wish for something more. Not in terms of visuals or gameplay. Those technical elements are fundamentally flawless. Rather, in this story-driven, narrative-focused experience I want a game that is brave enough to actually say something, and give me something to think about. Challenge me on a level beyond my ability to press buttons. God of War: Ragnarök manipulates emotions expertly and people often mistake that for depth. The relationship dynamic between Kratos and Atreus is appealing enough and I’m sure plenty of other reviews will talk about how it made them feel things. There are also plenty of big moments that we’re not allowed to talk about because of spoilers but, yes, those narrative set pieces really are dramatic. These things aren’t depth, though. Ragnarök is popcorn entertainment, and there’s nothing inherently wrong with that. This game’s going to sell a billion copies for a reason. It’s just worth drawing the distinction, because Sony could also be pushing for much more than what it does with these blockbusters.","God of War: Ragnarök manages to set a new standard, striking the right balance between profound storytelling and invigorating gameplay.","God of War Ragnarök is one of the best games of the year, and it's a game you'll remember for a long time. It will appeal to you with well-written characters, fun action gameplay and audiovisual presentation. Only annoying bugs can spoil this great gaming experience.","God of War Ragnarok is an incredibly special game. It's vital in a way few releases are. With captivating performances that carry an amazing story to a jaw-dropping final act, it’s a game that achieves everything it sets out to do to the absolute highest standard.","God of War Ragnarök straight blows up your mind. It is a way better game than whatever you might imagine and it is definitely the best game in the whole franchise. It actually does it all: its narrative, story-wise, the characters or gameplay, and of course the visuals; it simply is outstanding. The game lasts for about 40 hours and provides one surprise after another, it just does not make any sense at all.","Some say God of War Ragnarok is a below-par effort from Santa Monica Studio, because in reality it’s just a glorified PS4 game. You know what? Just ignore those voices. It’s an excellent sequel whose story perfectly sets the evolving relationship between Kratos and adolescent Atreus against the backdrop of key events from Norse mythology. The scale, the visceral combat, the end of the world looming on the horizon… Play this game, it’s worth it.",,"God of War Ragnarok is a fantastic showcase of what this series has to offer, and a sterling example of how it still has life left in it.","God of War Ragnarök is a triumph. It’s a swansong for the PS4 and one of the best first-party games for the PS5 so far. It’s bigger than its predecessor in every way. The game’s only flaw is the weak climax. Everything up to that part is gold. However, it’s hard to find a conclusion that’ll satisfy everyone when the stakes are basically everything.","If you love northern mythology, while also can enjoy stories about fatherhood and can appreciate deep combat systems, then God of War Ragnarök is something you should not miss.","Despite its shortcomings and eagerness to wrap things up, God of War Ragnarök feels like a better game than its predecessor in almost every aspect.","The story of God of War Ragnarök may not be as straightforward as it was in God of War, but that’s to its credit. It’s messy and complicated, but that makes the emotional payoff all the better. The gameplay remains largely unchanged, which unfortunately does lose it some points with me, but it does feel enjoyable when the player can settle into a rhythm. God of War Ragnarök is an exceptionally good game, and if you loved the last one, you’ll almost certainly love this one too.","Nothing about God of War Ragnarok feels anything less than meaningful. Refined to the highest degree, every hour you spend with Kratos, Atreus, and the memorable characters of Ragnarok feels fulfilling – whether it be journeying across the Nordic realms with your companions, taking in the beautiful sights and enjoying idle chit chat, overcoming the odds in invigorating and varied melee combat encounters, or sharing in the deeply emotional connection between incredibly strong and nuanced characters.","There's so much more we could say about God of War Ragnarok, but to do so would spoil the experience for you. Ultimately, all you need to know is that this is bigger and better than 2018's God of War in every single way. Its boss battles are the definition of epic, its world is more rewarding to explore, and its combat has been refined to perfection. Throw in a story that grips you from the outset and has you wondering where it will go from one moment to the next, and you have a game that sticks you to your seat like glue. Sit down to play and minutes turn into hours – it's so hard to pull yourself away from it. All we have is love for this God of War.",Another masterpiece from Santa Monica Studio. God of War Ragnarök is the highly anticipated sequel to 2018's God of War that delivers on all fronts.,"By the time the credits finally rolled on God of War Ragnarök, I was in bits. There’s so much I still want to tell you about, but I know that if I do I’ll be robbing you of the same joy I experienced. So I’ll leave you simply with this: Ragnarök is a fantastically impressive sequel that delivers in every conceivable way. It expands on and improves the formula established in 2018’s God of War hugely, offering up blistering action, gut-wrenching twists, and truly cinematic boss battles with real emotional heft behind them. This is a high-stakes, high-fantasy rollercoaster from start to finish, and an instant PlayStation classic.","God of War Ragnarok is the definition of a masterpiece, featuring some of the best combat of all time, a gripping, poignant, and ambitious story, with so much to do you'll never want it to end.","There haven’t been many interpretations of ancient mythology as gripping, detailed and imaginative as this, in video games or any other medium. It brings the stories and characters of an ancient era to life in a way that only modern technology could realise.","God of War Ragnarok is an amazing feat in storytelling, combat, characters, and spectacle. This gripping adventure about a father and son trying to do what is right keeps you hooked throughout while putting you through the wringer both in its gameplay and emotional storytelling. Ragnarok builds on 2018 in every aspect cementing it as a masterpiece in gaming.","God of War Ragnarok is a work of art, from narrative elements to the construction of the Nine Realms. A sequel worthy of a god, capable of making us cry and tremble with the fury of combat.","God of War Ragnarök is a masterpiece. Even though the game maintains many elements that were established in its predecessor, it refines them to create an unforgettable experience. The quintessential storytelling is a highlight of the medium and its impeccable combat will keep you enthralled throughout. Although Santa Monica Studios set a high bar with their previous outing, Ragnarök soars above it.","God of War: Ragnarok is an unforgettable title. I will remember every epic moment, and also every emotional sentence. Because the new adventure of Kratos and Atreus is not just another sequel in the videogame world; it is a work that has a clear idea of what it wants to tell, it gets it right in the way it does it and it will also move you as few games have done.","If you are on the fence with this game, trust me, this is a title that you will regret missing out on if you wait for the price to go down. It is so heavily story dependent that there is no way you will be able to go on social media without inadvertently finding out things that should be a pleasant surprise discovered within the game itself! I employ you to make sure you grab your copy at launch so as not to miss a single special moment by yourself and not through the experience of others. God of War: Ragnarok is just that; an experience to be treasured.","God of War: Ragnarok is a natural evolution of the 2018 title, featuring an excellent story, an amazing technical side, new gameplay features, incredible battles and lots of varied content to explore. Easily a game of the year contender, Kratos and Atreus' new adventure is unforgettable and satisfyingly concludes this chapter of the Norse mythology.","God of War Ragnarok is beautiful, rich, exciting, and even bigger and better than the 2018 adventure, which shows that passion and quality work has gone into its creators. I had many doubts about whether a sequel to something that reinvented the wheel of the god of war would be able to surpass its predecessor and admit, with great pleasure, that I was wrong. This is a must-do adventure for action-adventure fans, and probably Kratos' best adventure in a video game. It's a work of art, a retelling of the hero's journey and a game that delivers on everything it promised and more, and serves as an excellent conclusion to the Norse arc of Kratos and Atreus.",,"Grandeur and epicness have caused a little bit of harm to Ragnarok - the 2018 God of War is by all means a better game. Not all new things work in the sequel. Still, I believe that this is a game worth checking out, and if you liked the first one - you simply HAVE to.","It’s rare to see a sequel nail it this hard, but God of War: Ragnarök has once again raised the bar for every action adventure title. It’s the best game I’ve played in a very, very long time, and is, in a word, perfect.","In the end, I can't shake how captivating the chemistry among the characters was in God of War: Ragnarok. I probably laughed and got misty-eyed more times in the first few hours of playing this than I did for the whole first game. Plenty of heavy themes are tackled here other than life and death: alcoholism, abusive relationships, codependency, depression, emotional breakthroughs, true father-and-son bonding, manipulation, etc. You could call this game God of War: Families, Amirite? I've deliberately been vague about many of the key plot points, funny exchanges and gut-punch moments because I think people need to experience them for themselves. I probably already said too much regarding the bears, but they left an impact. The rest of God of War: Ragnarok will make quite an impression as well, and perhaps provide lessons that can outlive us all.","God of War Ragnarök is more God of War, but in the best way possible. If you enjoyed the last game and wonder if the sequel meets expectations, than the short answer is: yes. You won't be disappointed.","All in all, God of War Ragnarok is a complete product and a true continuation of a game that was already almost perfect. Sony Santa Monica kept the aspects that put the original at the top and solved some of its problems, such as the level structure, the little variety of enemies and the lack of balance in the combat system. This is God of War at its highest level.","God of War Ragnarok is a triumph. Santa Monica Studio has successfully taken everything that was great about the last game and amplified it while correcting just about every problem area and then some. There are slight stumbles, but it's a constantly surprising, epic adventure that shows genuine growth in its characters, backed up by best-in-class combat and a menagerie of breathtaking scenes. This makes Ragnarok an easy GOTY contender and one of the best games I've played in years.","If you haven’t played God of War Ragnarok, what are you even doing with your life? Playing Gotham Knights? Get the hell outta here. Buy the game before it gets Game of the Year…AGAIN.","Ragnarok is the brilliant finale that fans of the predecessor dreamed of, with a slight drop in pacing.",Everything in God of War Ragnarok is carefully crafted to create a superb experience both cinematically and when it comes to gameplay. It may not break any new ground in the world of gaming but what's here is still undeniably awesome.,"God of War Ragnarok is one for the ages. An epic journey with astonishing visuals, memorable characters and one of the best gameplays ever. Just like the fans expected, it’s truly a masterpiece.","Ragnarök is well worth playing even if some of its callbacks fly over your head. We only get a handful of single-player games each year that deliver such high-calibre storytelling, finely tuned action, and gorgeous graphics in a single package, and Sony’s Dad of War ranks high among them once more.","Thanks to an amazing cast that’s doing an outstanding job, a compelling story told through the eyes of multiple characters, and top-notch combat, this epic and heartfelt journey strikes all the right chord. It’s impossible not to recommend God of War Ragnarok, but just in case you had any doubts, I strongly advise anyone mildly interested in gaming to play Santa Monica Studio’s latest masterpiece.",God of War Ragnarok is a testament to the franchise that exceeded our expectations and can easily compete for the title of best game of the year. A true love letter to God of War fans and a masterpiece that will be remembered.,God of War Ragnarok is an example of when to not mess with perfection. It features powerful themes we can all somehow relate to and offers a rollercoaster of emotions that keeps you hooked until the end.,"Kratos and Atreus continue their journey in a new adventure that delivers dozens of hours of gameplay. God of War: Ragnarök mainly offers more of the same as you played the previous part, but in every way slightly more refined, better and more extensive. Do not expect major innovations, but that is not a bad thing. The gameplay is wonderfully smooth in combat thanks to the excellent performance. The alternation between exploring, puzzling and the many dialogues means that you will not be bored for a second, thanks in part to the very diversely designed realms that you will visit. Add to that magnificent voice acting, a strong soundtrack and impressive graphic presentation and the message is clear: God of War: Ragnarök is a worthy sequel that you can buy blindly.",,"God of War Ragnarok is phenomenal. Even amongst PlayStation Studios' typically stellar output it's a showpiece — a masterfully crafted game that smashes expectations at almost every turn. The sheer, often ridiculous scope of Ragnarok makes 2018's God of War feel like a prologue — and that's perhaps the highest praise we can bestow upon a sequel.","God of War Ragnarok is an epic action adventure game. The story is solid. It uniquely interprets Norse mythology and takes you by the hand through an entertaining narrative. The combat mechanics fully serve their purpose, and the progression system goes hand in hand with exploring the 9 Kingdoms, which was a great idea. We will talk for a long time about God of War Ragnarok for everything it contributed to gaming in a time when games are developed between two generations with very different capabilities.","Kratos and Atreus are back to bring an epic Ragnarök to your PlayStation - and it’s going to take significantly longer than last time. The action is great, the puzzles inventive and the story gripping. The only thing that’s possibly missing is a bit more innovation here and there.","God of War Ragnarök is perhaps neither technically nor in terms of gameplay the giant leap forward from the previous part that we had hoped for. But it is a fantastic, grand and compelling adventure that is impossible to put down; nothing short of essential for players of the 2018 game.","A more flawed experience than its predecessor, with a sense that the formula is already starting to wear thin, but the character-based storytelling with Kratos and his son is handled masterfully well.","Trust us, you'll love experiencing the prophetic end of the world in God of War Ragnarok. This new episode contains a moving, epic, generous and extremely dense epic. Santa Monica does at least very well in every aspect of its game and promises to make you feel a string of emotions, enough to brush aside its few weaknesses. And then if the sensations in terms of gameplay are not upset by drastic changes, they remain exceptional and are filled with very beautiful additions. If you thought that the Nordic saga would have nothing new to offer, the adventure of Ragnarok quickly shows you the opposite.","God of War Ragnarok is a masterpiece, dense in its strewn spectacle and narrative bulk, nearly overwhelming in its vast scale.",Kratos and Atreus’s latest adventure will tick a lot of boxes for fans of the 2018 game. But some odd narrative choices hold it back from joining the immortal pantheon.,"While God of War Ragnarok manages to “be better” with its presentation, combat, and exploration, its story falls a little flat with too many should-be standout moments failing to land. However, for those who can focus on the near-perfect journey rather than becoming all-consumed by the disappointing destination, Ragnarok delivers an epic sequel that is better in almost every way, further bolstering the catalog of must-play exclusives wielded by PlayStation.","God of War Ragnarok is a complex, thoughtful game that takes everything that made its predecessor an unmissable experience to even greater heights. Its story is full of memorable characters, woven seamlessly into a series of worlds that feel more alive than ever, and its combat continues to add interesting new wrinkles dozens of hours in. Ragnarok is here, and it is glorious.","God of War: Ragnarök is a modern epic poem, a great tale of change, a crucible full of content. It requires the user to understand - and above all choose whether to welcome - the creative ambition of the authors: powerful in the message, bittersweet in the story, undoubtedly distant from the historical soul of the God of War “video game”, but undeniably majestic. To date, there is no video game that can boast action sequences of the same quality as those that emerged in God of War: Ragnarök, just as there is no title that can count on the same staging.","God of War Ragnarök isn't free from weak spots, but the game is better in nearly every aspect than its great predecessor. There is more variety in combat. There are more spectacular boss fights. And you will visit all nine regions of Norse Mythology, all of them looking amazing on PS5. There is no way around this great adventure, if you love the series, action games in general and own a current PlayStation.","God of War Ragnarök is an innocuous sequel that continues on the path laid out by its predecessor. The writing and narrative leave something to be desired, but with solid gameplay and great presentation, there's plenty to see and do in these Nine Realms.","Once the first 5 hours of God of War Ragnarök have passed, which look like a giant tutorial, the adventure finally really begins and becomes an epic odyssey, much more ambitious than the first episode. The gameplay gains in depth with relevant or ingenious additions, the fights slam hard, especially the bosses (finally colossal monsters!) and exploration will take you to sometimes immense and visually very varied kingdoms. But we especially retain from this God of War Ragnarök a breathtaking staging which multiplies the spectacular and emotive sequences. A truly must-have.","God of War Ragnarok presents a fantastic conclusion to the Norse saga, pushing Kratos and Atreus to a level in storytelling matched by few. Every character is impeccably written, having me in stitches one minute and in tears the next. The Nine Realms are stunning to explore with an exceptional level of detail, an abundance of different enemy designs and significant side-missions that are frankly unavoidable. Sony Santa Monica has quite possibly delivered the greatest one-two punch in video game history.","It’s no PS5 revolution, but it is one of the most finely crafted adventures we’ve ever played, mixing thrilling combat with fab storytelling. [Issue#21, p.68]","God of War Ragnarok isn’t just an amazing game and one of the best action adventures games in recent years, this game is also the legitimization of Sony’s way of making AAA games. [Recommended]","If you come to God of War Ragnarök hoping for a story that's as tightly focused and emotional as its predecessor, you're likely to come away disappointed. But if you go in looking for a well-written and well-acted romp with the same kind of high-impact, tactical action combat as the 2018 game, you'll come away with a smile on your face.","Much like its heroes, God of War: Ragnarök learns to love itself for what it truly is: gargantuan, excessive, and wonderfully absurd. [Eurogamer Recommended]",,"Yes, the axe is cool. Sure, the fights are tons of fun. And I definitely enjoyed exploring every nook and cranny of the large worlds you get to visit. But what kept me glued to my PS5 for nearly 40 hours was the story of a son becoming a man and a father trying to figure out how he feels about that. I probably could have enjoyed this story a tad more with about half as many puzzles and skill menus, but even so, I found myself smiling, feeling satisfied, as the credits rolled. As I said at the start, God of War Ragnarök is very good.","Popular entertainment these days is obsessed with lore to a fault. Disney’s Marvel and Star Wars franchises have entire councils of people devoted to keeping lore straight across these stories. Even 2022′s biggest game, “Elden Ring,” was essentially a story all about lore. Despite tapping into well-mined Norse mythology, “Ragnarok” is focused squarely on seeing and hearing its characters. Like Kratos, you will actually like spending time with them. The memories of these people will stay with you long after the credits roll. By the end, you will believe that even a god of war can earn himself some peace.","There is nothing life-changing about the way Ragnarök wraps up, but it delivers the same pleasant satisfaction that I get from finishing a Marvel movie that lets me run on autopilot. Even where the game can be frustrating, rote, and uneven, it’s also safe and comforting, like a rerun of Cheers where everyone knows your name and you know that you’ll never get thrown out of the bar. God of War Ragnarök, as the sum of its many disparate and often conflicting parts and influences, isn’t here to reinvent the wheel. But its single-minded desire to emulate all the hallmarks of an epic Hollywood narrative will remain both its biggest weakness and its enduring source of success. And like many, many Hollywood success stories, it shouldn’t feel this weird to say that something of this scope and scale is just OK.","God of War Ragnarök is to God of War (2018) as God of War II was to God of War. God of War II may not have changed much mechanically, but it made nuanced improvements to gameplay, story and level design, all while injecting much-needed variety into the enemies and environments. These improvements yielded a fantastic sequel that remains one of the best entries in the franchise.","God of War Ragnarok is a masterclass in storytelling and design, and it'll easily stand the test of time as one of PlayStation's finest games.","It may no longer have the impact of its predecessor, but it is the perfect example that it is not always necessary to reinvent the wheel and that, sometimes, it is enough to polish and improve what already seemed unbeatable to make history again and leave a mark. indelible in an industry that, with titles like this, reminds us why we keep playing. Simply essential.","God of War Ragnarok is an outstanding game that will stand as a beacon for what storytelling greatness should be. With an improved combat system, impressive new enemies, immersive environments, and unparalleled storytelling, God of War Ragnarok delivers one of the deepest, richest gaming experiences to date.","Kratos has come a long way since first flinging himself into the Aegean all those years ago. God of War, as a series, has come a long way too, pushing the boundaries of hack and slash action to their goar-soaked limits, then breaking free of a years-long slumber to become one of the biggest names in modern gaming. As our own winter approaches, God of War Ragnarok makes for the perfect adventure to lose yourself in.",,"The quality of God of War: Ragnarok exceeds expectations. If you are looking forward to a sequel that is fully enhanced on the basis of God of War, then Ragnarok is definitely the game you want. Its gaming experience is completely an enjoyment. Most importantly, The plot of Ragnarok is based on respecting both the character and fans. For Kratos, a beloved character, we may not hope he will be the ""God killer""again, but he can get a good home and someone will inherit his legacy and continue the story of ""God of War"".","An incredible adventure from beginning to end, God of War Ragnarök is epic in scale and nuanced in character. Its combat and gameplay haven’t changed much but why fix almost peerless systems? Ragnarök is an absolute must-play on the PS5 and a worthy contender for Game of the Year.",God of War Ragnarok surpasses its predecessor in every way.,,"God of War Ragnarok is as good as the previous title from 2018, but for completely different reasons. Its gameplay is more complete, deep and with a more rewarding combat system. But, as a sequel so similar to the prequel, it doesn't show any real innovation and all the exploration could show some fatigue. It is a ""more of the same"": an awesome, marvelous, fun and long-lasting more of the same.","We certainly appreciated both the expansion of the explorable scenarios, as well as that of the environmental enigmas that mark the progression, among the meshes of a world capable of kidnapping the senses in a continuous succession of breathtaking views. In short, net of some small roughness, the latest work by Santa Monica Studio has given us an extraordinary experience, destined to leave an indelible mark in the collective memory of the videogame audience. we certainly appreciated both the expansion of the explorable scenarios, as well as that of the environmental enigmas that mark the progression, among the meshes of a world capable of kidnapping the senses in a continuous succession of breathtaking views. In short, net of some small roughness, the latest work by Santa Monica Studio has given us an extraordinary experience, destined to leave an indelible mark in the collective memory of the videogame audience.",God of War: Ragnarok is one of the best games of the year and simply one of the biggest evolution for the action-adventure genre to date.,"It’s hard to find much of anything to complain about when it comes to God of War Ragnarok. The complex characters and storyline provide a plethora of feelings. The developers have breathed so much depth and life into this series that previously focused on combat over narrative substance. There’s still plenty of violent combo-focused action, but the option for exploration and puzzle-solving balances out the mechanics and adds a bit of curve to the otherwise linear storyline.","Balancing a heartfelt story with over-the-top excessive video game action, Ragnarök is completely self-aware. It improves upon the previous title in all the ways we could have hoped for and delivers a huge experience with stunning visuals, beautiful storytelling and buckets of fun. This is a must have for any God of War fan and an easy recommendation for anyone new to the series.","If you’re at all invested in these characters, this world, and their adventures through Midgard and beyond, God of War Ragnarok is a supremely worthy sequel.","For a plot that’s rooted in prophecy, “Ragnarök” still manages to surprise at every turn, pulling off a jaw-dropping twist at its eleventh hour. Its storytelling is simply unmatched, with several cutscenes bringing me to tears (both of laughter and sadness). It sticks the landing, too, with an emotional gut-punch bringing its tale to a close...God of War Ragnarök is a 10 out of 10, checking every box with a combination of pulse-pounding action, humor and character development that will stay with players long after they’ve completed the campaign. It’s a masterpiece that proves even an old god can learn new tricks.",God of War Ragnarok is a triumph in designing an epic adventure on an established mythology. Nothing less.,"God of War Ragnarök is a spectacular sequel, retaining the same ultra-satisfying combat as its predecessor, but with a more grandiose story to boot.","Santa Monica did it once again. God of War Ragnarok offers us pretty much everything, relatable characters, the evolution of the combat that won us over in 2018, epic and stunning settings and a huge world to explore, with a guarantee of dozens of hours of gameplay and a set of characters of curious characterization, something that we know will be widely discussed. Until November 9, stay away from spoilers and enjoy, Ragnarok could be just around the corner.","So much information is communicated to you so naturally by subtle things – the clunk of an inert attack on an armoured enemy, or the slight twinkle of a fully-charged swing – that finding your own style within the skillset is instinctive. And that’s without the jarring stops and slowdowns that give knuckle-cracking impact to every hit and have you throwing yourself into each shot, like a football manager kicking every ball for their team on the sidelines. You get the biggest sense of this in the many, passionately fierce boss fights that punctuate the game. They do a great job of incorporating unique mechanics without coming off as cheap or overly simple. And, really, these boss fights are emblematic of what makes God of War Ragnarok great: they’re hugely successful meldings of an involving story and brutal action that not only produce an eye-popping, absorbing spectacle, but an impassioned investment in the outcome as well.","God of War: Ragnarok is, simply put, the complete package. It tells one of the best stories in video games, one that will have you run the gamut of emotions while playing through it. Fighting the enemies of the realms feels a lot like the previous game, but there's enough new and refined elements to help it stand on its own.[...] Ragnarok may be coming, but this is one world-ending event I'm excited to experience over and over again.",God of War Ragnarok is an almighty achievement and creates a new high that makes many of its peers look mortal by comparison.,"God of War Ragnarok represents a culmination of the two decades Santa Monica Studios spent working and learning about this franchise. This game will be remembered for a long time for not only its impressive visuals and script, but also gameplay improvements over its predecessor.","God of War: Ragnarok is simply fantastic. The story is excellently told, the characters outstandingly written, and the many gameplay innovations so well thought out and fun that the entire game is just a joy to play. From the first hour to the last, I found myself emotionally rooting along and worrying about the fate of the characters. The twists and turns in the story and all the sometimes really ingenious ideas captivated me time and time again.","The God Of War experience has never felt better, it’s more satisfying to play through than ever before, and possesses more heartstring-twisting moments than you’ll likely be able to bare. God Of War Ragnarok is proof positive just how exceptional this medium can be, and a game that, especially when paired with its predecessor will rock you to your very core once you’re through with it.","God of War Ragnarok is as slick and beautifully crafted a game as you will play this generation, and my experience with it has been delightfully bug-free.","After the dust has settled and the credits have rolled, God of War Ragnarok is as strong a continuation as anyone could have hoped for, and a fitting end to Kratos’s latest chapter...Few game loops have been as engaging to experiment with and ultimately master than Kratos’s own brutality, but by adding new dimensions to an already intoxicating equation, the game successfully manages to deliver on the high expectations its predecessor laid bare at the altar…On its own merits, it’s difficult to fault but on the foundations of 2018’s God of War, it’s nothing short of a masterpiece.","God of War Ragnarok is the epitome of cinematic gaming experiences. It's an unforgettable, magical adventure teeming with treasures to find, legendary opponents to slay, and relationships to forge along the way. At its core, the experience is built around a near-perfect core gameplay loop that sinks its Chaos Blades into you and refuses to let go.","Sony Santa Monica has created something special. To take one of the best action games of the last decade and improve it to such a degree, in every single way, is mind-blowing. It tells an epic yet intimate story about connection, trust, and ambition while letting you tag along for the ride with combat that is flawlessly varied, fluid, and so much fun. God of War Ragnarok is the perfect sequel.","God of War Ragnarök is more of the epic God of War that we loved in 2018, but it builds on those foundations in every single way to create a compelling and addicting adventure in its own right that improves across the board. Combat is furious and intense, exploring every nook and cranny of each Norse realm is captivating, and clever puzzles are seamlessly intertwined with abilities that change, evolve, and make you feel like a master of all crafts. Narratively, the heartfelt and fascinating story is supported by incredible writing that makes its whole cast of characters shine, and the production values are through the roof, with a gorgeous soundtrack and visuals that push the limits and stun at every turn. Santa Monica Studios have again managed to create something truly memorable and entirely special.","God of War Ragnarök is a worthy continuation of (and conclusion to) 2018’s God of War, building on that already strong foundation to deliver an experience deserving of a spot in gaming’s pantheon. New tools and greater enemy variety elevate combat, and the expanded environments and cast give this sequel the epic scope its story demands. But the beating heart of the game remains its characters, and Ragnarök delivers an immensely satisfying next chapter for just about everyone—Kratos and Atreus, returning friends, and new faces alike.",The New Gold Standard: The Adventures of Krateus and Atreus sets the standard in many respects - an absolute must-read for anyone who loves action games.,"Though it is hard to be certain that this is the greatest game of all time, It definitely has its rightful place around the masterpieces. The relatively simple narrative has become more complex but solid, characters' individuality and Santa Monica's directing skills combined to show the best-ever narrative delivery. The level design and combat sequence, which were close to the best, have also been able to take a step further. The one and only drawback to this game is that this is the last of its great saga.","This is unarguably a beautiful game, perfectly doing its job of continuing and improving its predecessor. The game has one of the best graphics of the current generation and the gameplay is characteristic of its creators. It needs more integration with the Dualsense and the loading screens should have been a little shorter, above all else this has been my best mythic journey.","God Of War Ragnarok is an instant addition to the collection of PlayStation classics, standing as one of the best games of all time. It manages to outdo its predecessor in every way possible and despite some of its issues with its ending and a few plot points feeling rushed, it does not take anything away from the masterpiece this title is. Santa Monica Studio continues to produce excellent and masterful experiences with Kratos, and the door is most certainly open for more.","God of War Ragnarök is a spectacular action game with a monumental scale, filled with moments that will go down in gaming posterity, accented with visceral and brutal combat. A production of the highest budget, worthy of gods.",An epic and exciting journey for a game that embodies the best of the new essence of God of War.,"The surprise effect of the new formula is gone, but its power remains. The first game was already pushing the limits of what we could expect from a blockbuster on consoles, this sequel only widens the gap. More than the colossal work of Santa Monica, it's also the result of a vision of action-adventure with a high narrative content explored for a few years now by Sony PlayStation and its first party studios. A total success on which we can find very few things to say: God of War Ragnarök is definitely a title that commands respect.","God of War Ragnarök feels a lot like God of War (2018), which is a compliment considering how fantastic that game is. Sony Santa Monica was right to not break what wasn’t broken and it has expertly continued the story threads that were left hanging from the previous game. Any complaints about the overall experience (familiar combat, collecting and leveling up equipment isn’t particularly interesting) are quickly forgotten in the face of the compelling narrative, believable character relationships, and incredible visuals and animation. Even from its early PlayStation 2 days, the God of War series has always set a high, quality bar for itself, and with few exceptions, it manages to leap above that bar. God of War Ragnarök is no different.","Ragnarök is here, and it is everything you expect from a God of War game (and some more). It has the personal, emotional storytelling of GoW (2018), epic and brutal battles of Greek-era and a unique, interesting take on Norse mythology. It's a beautiful and satisfying sequel through and through.","There is a venn diagram for God of War 2018 fans where some liked the combat, others liked the story, and many enjoyed both. Ragnarok is everything you loved about the previous title, but amplified. The longer story and expanded worlds gives way for characters to develop in meaningful ways, making the whole game feel very much like a sequel worthy of its predecessor.","With vivid environments and incredible acting, God of War Ragnarök is the sequel that we have been waiting for.","Brutal, deep but above all fun: the combat system of God of War Ragnarök is worthy of the god of war himself! The exploration shows the side of a certain repetitiveness that in the long run tends to tire, but the epic nature of the plot and the sumptuous technical realization make the conclusion of the journey of Kratos and Atreus a show worth living to the full.","Captivating story, rad gameplay. God of War Ragnarök masterfully blends established features with new ideas.","God of War Ragnarök is truly excellent. Quality seeps out of the thing, with so much effort put into even its less consequential elements. Richly detailed, terrifically written, all with a massively entertaining blend of combat and puzzles. The overwhelming amount of content can most certainly grow tiring at points and there are moments of disruptive meandering. Nevertheless, for a game to offer so much and retain such a high caliber is worthy of applause.","Few games released in 2022, or any year for that matter, are as well designed and made as God of War Ragnarök. While it doesn’t completely move beyond its predecessor, it eventually offers enough fresh content to stand apart, and additional variety helps make it the stronger game of the two, even if it’s perhaps a bit less focused. A beautifully told story that carries the themes of the prior game while allowing Atreus to stand on his own kept my interest until the very end. If you didn’t care for 2018’s God of War, then Ragnarök won’t change your mind, but everyone else should absolutely check it out.","Kratos' reboot signs-off after just two games, expertly unifying story with gameplay and proving a safe sequel can be brilliant.","When the God of War saga makes its Playstation 5 debut, we are treated to a grand adventure with strong characters, bombastic scenes, beautiful vistas, and exciting battles. At the same time, it is a very faithful sequel where it is noticeable that the roots are partly stuck in tech from 2013. In the end, Ragnarök is a worthy sequel and an excellent action game, but we cannot deny that we would have hoped for a little more.","God of War Ragnarok follows in the footsteps of the first game and is a quality production that players will love with the innovations and improvements it offers in every sense. If you loved the first game, you can be sure that you will love this one.","Still, these issues, while notable, don't bring down everything that's achieved here, and I'm looking forward to spending more time hunting down monsters, finding treasure, and admiring the Nine Realms in the future, as well as wondering just what will be next for Sony Santa Monica and God of War as a series.","The expectations were huge, but Kratos' shoulders are wide and even though the automatized actions are regrettable and offering more freedom to the player would benefit the game overall. Its story, its combat and its realization are outstanding. Santa Monica Studios manage to deliver a work of art, yet again.","God of War Ragnarok is a worthy follow up to the 2018 masterpiece. It’s easily one of the most epic games of the year, but it’s hard to shake the sense of safe familiarity, diminishing that rare, magical feeling that came with its predecessor. Combat is undeniably superior and more polished, but the story can drag on for long stretches of time, while the limited exploration is saved by excellently balanced puzzles, meaningful side activities, and engrossing conversations. Expectations are enormous, and despite some limitations, God of War Ragnarok delivers another precious entry to the tale of the Ghost of Sparta.",God of War Ragnarok builds upon everything the 2018 reboot established to deliver a greater gameplay experience that's filled with emotion and hard-hitting combat.,"Santa Monica Studio has captured lightning in a bottle for a second time. God of War Ragnarok left me speechless; it’s such a beautiful game both visually and narratively. The team has somehow managed to take what made the original such a wonder and expand upon it, delivering to players a masterpiece, an experience that sits atop the God of War pantheon.","Ragnarök chooses iteration over innovation, but continues to operate in a league of its own in terms of its nuanced gameplay and otherworldly technical execution. This is the new posterchild for what the PS5 is capable of, and the passionate product of a development outfit that can seemingly do no wrong.","For every moment of brutality, there is one of genuine and relatable emotion. How they land will vary from person to person, but there were multiple that left me with tears welling up. If nothing else, God of War Ragnarok further cements Sony Santa Monica's narrative team as one of the best in the business.","Where does this leave God of War Ragnarök when stacked against its Game of the Year foundation piece? That’s a hard question to answer. Diehard fans will eat this up, no doubt, but we can’t help but feel it could have gone to another level. There’s just a lot of familiar content and not enough new, from a gameplay sense, to really elevate it above God of War (2018), despite there being room with this iteration of God of War as a generational franchise to do that… unfortunately God of War Ragnarök’s fate wasn’t to be that game.","Despite having a couple of problems with God of War Ragnarok, it's hard for me to say that the game is anything less than excellent. Even with high expectations, Ragnarok ended up being a game that I thoroughly enjoyed from its bombastic opening to its character-driven conclusion. Some issues that the previous God of War entry had became more apparent to me with Ragnarok, but otherwise, this is a game that I believe fans are without a doubt going to be happy with.",God of War Ragnarök is an outstanding game with some questionable pacing and flow at times. There are moments in this game where I was simply in awe of what was on screen. Then there are times when the game feels like it is doing everything in its power to keep me from progressing or enjoying its playground.,"It’s a satisfying conclusion to the modern God of War saga, but it’s hard to walk away and not feel like this could have been something greater.","God of War: Ragnarok is a fantastic title, building from its predecessor's already phenomenal combat, though the story wasn't everything that I hoped it would be.","God of War Ragnarok is a good game but never particularly surprising. Shifting the focus onto Atreus’ story feels like a smart move and the universe painted here is as beautiful narratively as it is graphically, but some players may feel like they have ridden this ride before.","God of War Ragnarok is much bigger than its predecessor, though not inherently better. It’s more reminiscent of the jump between the original God of War in 2005 and God of War 2, offering a largely similar experience down to its plot beats. That larger scope makes for a messier story that loses some of the previous game’s intimacy, but the trade-off is even sharper combat that further establishes the franchise as the God of action games.","In the end, the growth of Kratos and Atreus as parent and child, protege and apprentice, is mirrored in the game’s making. And the game is all the better for it. When God of War reboot genius and maestro Cory Barlog announced he would not be directing Ragnarök, there was fear and worry from players. Would the sequel surpass the first? Could anyone else fill Barlog’s shoes? The proof is here. There is a moment in Ragnarök where Kratos realises he needs not to show Atreus to survive, but how to live. The result is the PS5’s crowning glory to date. By relinquishing control, trusting in Ragnarök’s director Eric Williams and the rest of the team – by giving them stewardship but not domineering their destination – the growth of Sony Santa Monica is right there on the screen.",That air of familiarity permeates the whole game and never really dissipates. It's a welcome familiarity because Ragnarok builds off such a strong foundation. Revisiting the Nordic realms in God of War: Ragnarok is sensational -- even if it's not as memorable as the first trip.,"The fact is that God Of War Ragnarök is a brilliant, beautiful game, blending compelling play with impressive production values and emotionally intelligent storytelling, all in ways this medium often struggles to do. If you were put off by the first game’s associations with the franchise’s tawdry past, or its past embrace of twitch-gaming difficulty, now might be a good time to re-evaluate that position. God Of War 2018 already had plenty to recommend it—we can now add “prelude to one of the best games of 2022"" to its list of accolades.","When I look at this game and compare it to its predecessor, God of War, Ragnarök feels like what God of War was supposed to be. This narrative of a terrible man trying to ensure his son does not repeat his mistakes while on this epic journey is better reflected in Ragnarök than in the first game. There were so many great moments, large and small, that left me breathless, like I had experienced the very best of what video games can be in both narrative and gameplay. When non-gaming people find out what I do for a living, they usually ask me for recommendations if someone wanted to understand the appeal of video games. I don’t keep a list; that’s too hard a question to answer because video games encompass so much, and what Sonic or Mario or Joel may do for one person will almost certainly not work for another. But despite its design frustrations and perfectly fine, if ho-hum, combat, God of War Ragnarök is now on that list.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It offers an overall experience in storytelling and gameplay that is top-notch regardless of genre. It's this incredibly unique type of game and play loop that turns your every failure and death into a reward of unlocking more story, injecting more humor, and inviting you to take a stab at one more run.

The gameplay is tight, complex and addictively fun to engage with. The visuals are absolutely stunning and the music is phenomenal on the PS5 with none of the “issues” of the Nintendo Switch version. So if you’re seeking a compelling game to invest your time in, this Rogue-Lite game called Hades is absolutely worth it!",,,,,,"For people still scarred by their Dark Souls, Sekiro or even Returnal experiences, consider this: This edition of Hades comes with a ""godhood"" mode, where you start out at 22% resistance, and then another 2% gets added each time you die. This might make the most ultra-hardcore elitists raise an eyebrow, but I think it's a brilliant way to make the game a little more accessible without doing a full bow to add a full-blown ""easy"" mode, which in my opinion mostly goes against the ethos of roguelikes. In this instance, you still have to go through a lot of pain to get stronger. You have to earn your easy, so to speak. To that end, I'm headed back into Hell with a smile.

Easily one of the best rogue-lite titles available, Hades lives up to the legend.","Hades on PS5 works perfectly. The resolution and textures look bright, colorful, and have very good quality.

An honest to Gods masterpiece, the likes of which are rarely seen anymore. As fun on the first run as on the fiftieth. What makes a Roguelike special is one that can keep the player engaged long term and there are so many little elements that will keep its audience coming back again and again. It's hard to find a flaw. To find a way this could be better. Supergiant have set their bar high here, delivering a game that will be used as an example in numerous areas for years to come.

Of course it goes without saying that it's gorgeous and makes fantastic use of the PS5's unique features as well.,"The best thing about this wonderful remake is that it truly feels like a new ""Souls"" game, rather than an old one being brought back to life.

Bluepoint Games did a spectacular job bringing back this huge classic. The best way to begin the PS5's cycle.,"Demon’s Souls is an incredibly faithful and gorgeous remake of one of the greatest games of all time. Bluepoint pulled off something incredible, all while under the pressure of being a launch title for an entirely new generation of hardware. Demon’s Souls feels genuinely Next-Gen and is in no way held back by the bones of the PS3 version. Demon’s Souls is the perfect PS5 launch title and the definite From Software game. For long-time Souls players, Demon’s Souls feels like coming home. For new players, there has never been a better time or a better entry to find your way into the dark fantasy worlds that From Software creates.","The Demon's Souls remake on PlayStation 5 is almost the exact same experience, gameplay-wise, as the 2009 PlayStation 3 original. And considering how great the original Demon's Souls was, the Demon's Souls remake on PS5 is an easy recommendation. Imagine one of the best and most influential games ever made, but with significantly improved graphics, and that sums up the Demon's Souls remake perfectly. It's the PlayStation 5's first must-have exclusive game, and it should leave fans very excited to see what developer Bluepoint Games decides to work on next.","If you need a challenge that is less forgiving than the Dark Souls’ series, then you want Demon’s Souls. Bluepoint Games brings the very essence of the original 2009 title with this remastered version, upgrades the experience with PS5 hardware, and makes the game more terrifying.","Bluepoint Games has proved itself once more, nailing Demon’s Souls with a remake on the same level as Shadow of the Colossus. At this point, I’d hand the developer the keys to everything. Let the studio make a 60fps Bloodborne. Give them Metal Gear Solid. Let’s have a Bluepoint Games Ico. Demon’s Souls is the best PS5 game you can play at launch, and I’m sure it will go down in history as one of the best launch titles of all time. The Old One has awoken and I hope this review feeds it more souls. It deserves a full belly.",,"It's a game that deserves to be elevated beyond the jokes and seen as a genuine piece of video game art. I would be very interested if those who have come to the Souls series later will find the deliberately unpolished elements of this remake to be as appealing, but given that FromSoftware will almost certainly never touch the King's Field series again, for me, personally, this is as good as it's ever going to get. As a PlayStation 5 launch title, it's a fascinating example of something that is both deliberately old and a brilliant use of the console's very new hardware, and brought together, Demon's Souls is reason enough to own the console, all into itself.","Demon’s Souls PS5 returns to the difficult strategic combat of the original and maintains its resolve in forcing players to figure things out on their own. Graphically, the remake offers a stellar reimagining of the 2009 classic while delivering a bittersweet audio experience. As a launch title for the PlayStation 5, Demon’s Souls has something to offer both Soulsborne veterans who want to see an old favorite shine and newcomers looking for a gritty, sometimes disheartening experience that demands perseverance.",,"It’s hard to imagine a better version of this game. Bluepoint established itself as the master of the remake with Shadow Of The Colossus, but in Demon’s Souls, they’ve produced a launch game that’s going to be hard to beat for several years.","Demon's Souls Remake is one of the best launch games that any new generation has ever experienced. However, we would have liked it even more if the DualSense's technology implementation was even deeper, given that at times it is barely noticeable. Nonetheless, Demon's Souls Remake is an impressive videogame due to both its longevity and possibilities. It is a work with almost no flaws whatsoever, born more than 10 years ago and back better than ever thanks to the PS5.","It’s a perfect remake and I think the only people who might be disappointed with it are… the die-hard FromSoftware fans. You see, the new Demon’s Souls shows clearly how much Miyazaki’s games have evolved throughout the years. The Dark Souls series simply does everything better. The remake looks like a prototype in comparison, while still being way ahead of other developers’ achievements in this genre.

This console generation is less than a week old, but something tells me we're still going to be raving about Demon's Souls when it comes to a close.","With a ton of replayability, a haunting and beautiful world, and satisfying gameplay, the PS5’s first exclusive hits it out of the park. Bluepoint did an excellent job updating Demon’s Souls to feature modern graphics and quality of life fixes without stripping anything away from the original. After how well this and Shadow of the Colossus turned out, I can’t wait to see which classic the studio tackles next.","Demon's Souls marks an important step for the video game industry as a whole, whilie Bluepoint Games developers yet again shows their immense care towards some truly cult classics. If you like the Souls series, or just looking forward to dive deep into medieval fantasy filled with dragons, demons, and knights, don't miss out on this masterpiece of a game.","Demon's Souls Remastered kicks off a new generation of console games with a bang. This recreation of FromSoftware's original Souls game is nothing short of stunning, though at times a bit too faithful. Despite some rough edges the experience still holds up well, and reaches all new heights thanks to Bluepoint's amazing attention to detail.","If you’re a seasoned Souls-like fan, then it’s worth picking up a PS5 just for Demon’s Souls. If not, I still recommend having your passport stamped in Boletaria, but know what you’re getting into beforehand and proceed with caution … and plenty of Moon Grass.",,,"Demon's Souls is the must-have PlayStation 5 exclusive as the showstopper of the launch lineup. It's so close to being a perfect 10. But some archaic mechanics left untouched, as well as questionable deluxe edition items giving an unfair head start, just prevent it from reaching that pinnacle. Nevertheless, if you want justification of why the PlayStation 5 is worth upgrading to at launch, look no further than Demon's Souls.","In a game that's about making smart decisions rather than having the best equipment, the Demon's Souls remake, as a product, ultimately has both. Bluepoint's processes of marrying the old and new have resulted in a truly stunning effort, making a decade-old critical darling a bona-fide system seller in 2020. Truly a remarkable feat, this should be picked up by anybody buying a PlayStation 5 whether you've played the original or not, and is a must-have for early adopters.","Fans of the Souls genre will fall in love with Demon's Souls, and anyone who picks it up and manages to push through the fog of challenge will find a stunning world of danger and excitement to get lost in.",,"Demon's Souls is an amazing game to show off that the PS5 is a graphical powerhouse. The mechanics from the original are intact, just like the grim and mysterious atmosphere. This might be the best launch game on the PlayStation 5.","A game that faithfully and fairly accurately recreates all that is good about the original, while at the same time feeling current. It feels next-gen.","New graphics and sound design aside, it’s still Demon’s Souls. And even after a decade and many Souls games now on the shelf, Demon’s Souls core is absolutely rock solid. With all the layers subsequent games added stripped away… wow. It speaks volumes about how well-designed From Software’s first take was. Swings are strategic. Dodge rolling is a survivor’s essence. Knowing when and how to engage each enemy is just as important as your stats. New motion-captured animations only add to the beautiful dance of death on display. You’ll sweat as hard here as you did the first time and you’ll be pissed when you die but ecstatic about your triumphs.","This game is every new-gen console's dream: an essential exclusive. Demon's Souls is a wonderful presentation for PlayStation 5, given that it honors a two generations in the past cult jewel and powers it with the new hardware possibilities.","No longer soul of the lost, and withdrawn from its (PS3) vessel, Bluepoint has transformed a cult classic into a modern next-gen marvel.",,,,,"Demon’s Souls 2020 is a gorgeous game that holds up thanks to a lovingly recreation and some helpful quality of life improvements.

Technically, it's almost perfect, visually jaw-dropping. On the gameplay side, it's almost the same game as twelve years ago. We can regret that some improvements seen in Dark Souls or Bloodborne are not part of the journey, but if you need one game for you PS5 or are tempted by discovering the Souls series, you can't miss it.",,"Lovingly remade and adapted to our day and age, this classic title is a must-buy for every PS5-owner. It still feels a bit dated, at times... but don’t let that spoil your fun.",,"Teensy quibbles aside, it’s difficult to imagine how this Demon’s Souls remake could be any better. It looks great, it sounds even better, and it’s extremely respectful of the PS3 original, which has aged surprisingly well after all these years.

When it comes to remasters of your favourite games, you should only ever wish for Bluepoint Games to make them.","Demon's Souls is a dazzlingly beautiful launch game, a decent Souls-like game and a technically powerful, but content-wise shallow remake.

Bluepoint retains its pedigree of respecting the original while making the new update seem wholly fresh. If you missed Demon’s Souls the first time around, or maybe if you just want to relive some old traumas, the PS5 remake is an excellent archstone to pass through for newcomers and Boletarian veterans alike. Who knew that one of the best PS5 launch titles would come from recapturing the lightning in a bottle that struck back in 2009? You may have died again, but Demon’s Souls lives on thanks to Bluepoint and the PS5.",,"It's ironic that the real killer-application of this new generation of consoles is a remake. On the other hand, Demon's Souls is a masterpiece in pure FromSoftware fashion, and Bluepoint Games are absolute masters at their craft. The result of this equation couldn't have been anything less than a must play.",,,"Demon's Souls may be a remake form a game released in 2009, but it's clearly the only game currently available that offers visuals that truly feel next gen. Moreover it's a very good remake of an already awesome game, a must buy if you have a PS5.",,,This remake is the perfect excuse to revisit or discover for the first time a work that strengthened the video game industry a decade ago.,"Also, gosh, it's nice to only wait about eight seconds after a brutal death for the game to load your next life, instead of two whole minutes. That's just one of many ways Bluepoint makes the die-and-retry reality of a Souls-like so much easier to savor on a new console like PlayStation 5. If you own one, and you've got the patience and stomach for challenge, don't hesitate to purchase this remastered classic.","There's friction between the original and this lavish remake, but this is a scintillating launch title that shows off the PS5's strengths. [Eurogamer Recommended]",,"Demon’s Souls on PlayStation 5 is very much the Demon’s Souls you remember from PlayStation 3. It doesn’t miss a beat, nailing the same melancholy atmosphere and compelling gameplay that would eventually spawn fellow instant-classics like Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. While there were bound to be a few aspects that could have been more faithful to the original, PlayStation 5’s Demon’s Souls remake stands out as an incredibly fun way to revisit the cursed land of Boletaria. It’s creepy. It’s gloomy. You’ll get invaded by laggy assholes near the end of a long level and have to do the whole thing over again.

Demon’s Souls is breathtakingly gorgeous and plays significantly better than it did on the PS3, not only thanks to the graphical power of the PlayStation 5, but because of smart quality-of-life changes and light touches that modernize some frustrating aspects of the original, without ever sacrificing the relentless challenge, puzzle-infused boss battles, and style that made it such a landmark game in the first place.",,,"While the journey through Demon’s Souls is one that has resulted in much frustration and higher blood pressure than I would normally put myself through just to play a video game, it is a wonderful showcase of what the PS5 can do and the perfect game for those that want to challenge themselves.

This is a game that honors its origins without being afraid to also modernize them, and though it might not offer enough modernization for some, this is probably the best balance between keeping what works and upgrading what didn’t that we could have gotten.","This milestone of action roleplaying games didn’t lose any of its fascination, while receving a new audiovisual presence with this excellent epic. An awesome modernized epic.",,,,,,"Demon's Souls was eagerly awaited for this PlayStation 5 launch and we are not disappointed, as the game has clearly already established itself as a major title in the PlayStation catalog. This next-gen version takes up all the basics of its first release and revisits the graphics and the optimization without adding new content. It is a stunning remake. We quickly forgot the somewhat rigid mechanics of the genre and let ourselves be carried away by the adventure. The Bluepoint teams have simply brought back to life a masterpiece that didn't have the success it deserved a decade ago.","For newcomers, Demon’s Souls will be the first exploration into the duality of despair and triumph, and hopefully go on to become a starting point for new Souls fans.

Bluepoint knocked it out of the park so far the ball killed someone in a distant suburb.","For fans of the original, there will be no problem facing the original Demon's Souls, hard and pure in an aesthetically sumptuous context, damn vivid even in the disturbing rottenness that surrounds it, while for others it may be difficult to swallow an extremely mechanical title, which has exactly the same flaws it had in 2009, especially on the artificial intelligence side. However, the experience remains fascinating, thanks above all to a masterful level design, galvanizing as well as terrifying, that dictates the rhythm of a role-playing experience that is certainly solid and violent.",,,,"While you’ll get a lot of enjoyment from your time with this title, FromSoftware has definitely refined and improved on the design and mechanics in the more recent released Souls games. Without a doubt Bluepoint Games has delivered a brilliant remaster of a niche game that not a lot of people had the chance to play originally. Demon’s Souls is worth checking out on the PS5. But if you’re looking to see what makes FromSoftware so amazing at what they do, you’re going to find a better overall experience in one of their newer titles like Dark Souls III, Bloodborne, or Sekrio: Shadows Die Twice.","Demon's Souls is the perfect example of how new hardware can take an existing game to the next level. The aesthetics are top notch and the horsepower of the Playstation 5 makes the world more engaging. But above all, the super-fast loading times help to balance an already ultra-difficult combat system. For those who are up to the challenge, Demon's Souls is the absolute best Sony's new machine has to offer.","Demon's Souls has managed to be a satisfying game in all aspects. With its revamped graphics, it fully embraces players who want to play again and who have not experienced it before.","Bug fixes, clever DualSense support, and truly stunning graphics turn this iconic PS3 title into the PS5's standout must-play. Whether you're a veteran or new to the world of Boletaria, you won't want to miss this special game.",,"The name ""Demon's Souls” comes with a lot of expectations, and Bluepoint has proven once again that they’re more than capable of carefully modernizing these beloved games without losing what made them special in the process. Demon's Souls on the PS5 is one of the finest examples of a remake out there thanks to its stunning visuals, great music, and numerous quality of life improvements. Most importantly, all the aspects that made the original such a classic like it's mysterious world, tight combat, and vicious bosses are painstakingly preserved. Whether you're a newcomer or a veteran, Demon's Souls is a journey worth taking and it’s an outstanding title to have out alongside the PlayStation 5’s launch.",,"As far as an action-RPG goes, Demon’s Souls is as tough, but rewarding as I’d expect a Soulborne game would be. Bluepoint did an incredible job of pulling this 2009 title into 2020 and giving all the gloss and polish the PlayStation 5 can wring out of it while still playing perfectly smooth and mostly free of loading. The combat feels tight and impactful, the area selection is delightful, and the character customization looks better than ever even by current Soulsborne standards. Smoothing out inventory systems and adding some more secrets is also a delightful plus. Even so, I just wish Bluepoint had gone all the way in inviting some improvements into the game’s archaic systems. Grinding items in a Soulsborne is just annoying and not being able to sell anything kills me inside. But if you can get past those things, Demon’s Souls is mostly on point as a high-quality upgrade to one of the foundations of this genre’s legacy.","I went in expecting the world out of the Demon’s Souls remake and it delivered me the galaxy. I don’t normally speak this highly of games, but this is the one exception. Absolutely every facet of the original has been enhanced and it has stood the test of time. Bluepoint has done an incredible job at not only reinvigorating an underappreciated gem, but also leveraging the new technologies afforded to them with Sony’s new system. While there are a couple of minor technical blemishes, they don’t take away from how good of an experience this game is and Bluepoint’s diligence as a developer will surely see these kinks ironed out. This game is a system seller.","Quirks aside, Bluepoint's remake is an unmitigated success. It is a technical tour de force and a true showpiece for the PS5 and the power of Sony's next-generation console. But, more importantly, it's also a creative marvel coming from a studio that is clearly showing the world it has its own voice. Bluepoint has taken From Software's original game and expressed it in a richer and fuller way, and in doing so given me something I thought was impossible: the opportunity to relive the experience of falling in love with Souls games for the first time.","There's no question in my mind that some elements could have been improved upon without negatively impacting the overall experience, and the blind pursuit of flawless recreation comes at what I feel is a heavy cost. You will find no better looking or better running game than Demon's Souls with the launch of the new consoles. But I think you will find no worse (From designed) Souls game.","The Demon’s Souls remake may flip perspectives on the Souls series once you’ve finished it. Instead of being a game that’s tough to go back to, its polish and refinement will make it hard to return to Lordran or Drangleic even if another game still ranks higher than Demon’s Souls. Completing the first playthrough is really just the start of Demon’s Souls, and with more replayability than ever before, it’s going to keep people dancing between the Archstones for a long time.","Coming hot off the heels after Shadow of the Colossus and now with Demon’s Souls, Bluepoint Games have cemented their name as the best in the business when it comes to remaking beloved classics. Not only have they managed to capture and retain all the elements that made the original so great, they have brought it to the modern age as the absolute showcase title for a new generation of consoles.","Demon's Souls is an instant classic, one of those rare retellings that stands triumphantly alongside the original as an essential experience. Indeed, the return of such an indelible classic on the PlayStation 5 is perhaps more than fans could have ever hoped for.","Incredibly, the most impressive game at the start of the new generation is a niche Japanese game I had to import from France in 2010. If you have to try one Souls game, I would suggest making it Demon’s Souls.",,,,,"They’ve preserved the warts with the same loving care that they’ve lavished on the core gameplay, which remains solidly satisfying even as it’s used in service of frequent gotchas or nasty tricks. Yes, the levels are too long. Yes, the game’s consumable healing items lack the elegance of Dark Souls’ self-replenishing estus. Yes, the trick with the boss that just keeps respawning until you go kill the innocuous zombie standing on her balcony a billion miles away is unimaginable horseshit. But also, yes: That sense of running through the labyrinths of a demented, cackling dungeon master, daring you to stay alive ahead of rolling boulders and tricksy ambushes—while unseen friends leave you messages warning you away from the worst of the deathtraps—is still alive and well.",,"Slay demons, grow your strength, and save the land of Boletaria once more in a faithful remake of a Souls classic. An incredible makeover with the original spirit kept intact provides a challenge unfit for the faint of heart, but the more rewarding for it. [Issue#308]","Game visuals might need overhauls every few years to stay relevant, but good game design is timeless. So is Demon's Souls.","The most underappreciated Souls game is ready to take its place atop the pantheon. Demon’s Souls has always been one of From Software’s most intricate, atmospheric, and satisfyingly-challenging games and Bluepoint’s technically-impeccable remake elevates it to a new level with beautiful, fluid visuals and an assortment of smart gameplay tweaks. All From Software fans need this game, and even those who have struggled with their games should consider giving it a try. Once you start playing Demon’s Souls you’ll be hard-pressed to exorcise the game from your PS5.","An excellent remake, which takes full advantage of the technology of PlayStation 5 to release the catalog of the new Sony console and offers its community the possibility of reliving a masterpiece.","Nothing less than a splendid, relentlessly sadomasochistic bout of déjà vu that lasts for more than 40 hours at a time.","Even old Demon’s Souls hats will find plenty new to marvel at in this faithful and stunning recreation that showcases just why PS5 is so impressive. [Issue#183, p.83]","It’s still an amazingly stubborn classic, one that manages to feel individualistic even now. It doesn’t do everything right, but the remake proves the bones of the original game are still strong and relevant today. Like all of FromSoftware’s latest games, Demon’s Souls gets under your skin with a combination of abject aggravation followed by glorious elation. It’s currently the best reason to own a PlayStation 5, and will likely still be an easy recommendation when we start thinking about PlayStation 6.","Revisiting Demon’s Souls in this fancy new package was some of the most fun I’ve had all year. The return to Boletaria was a pleasant reminder of just how good the game is, and the influx of new players makes it the current definitive choice for someone looking to get into the series. There’s a certain boldness to releasing the game relatively functionally the same so that a whole new generation of people can experience just how weird it is. While the facelift can cause some dissonance, most will experience a beautiful action RPG with some of the most tightly-designed levels and a bevy of different ways to approach the game. It may not be a brand new game, but even all these years later there still isn’t anything else quite like it.","Demon’s Souls is an unrelenting blast from the past, reforged with numerous quality of life changes and looking better than ever thanks to the PS5 hardware that gives this old-gen classic a true next-gen update.","Regardless of my qualms with how Bluepoint handled the boss themes, I believe this is a tremendous remake of Demon’s Souls. It plays exceptionally now that its framerake is silky smooth and is one of the most visually sublime games today. This is one of the best launch titles I’ve seen, and I’ll certainly be coming back to it again and again. If this is a small glimpse of what I can expect to see in the future of this generation of games, I’m ecstatic.","My love for the original Demon’s Souls hasn’t changed with the introduction of the remake. Like Scholar of the First Sin, the remake stands alongside the original - both can be enjoyed in their own unique ways and do different things well. Since Bluepoint largely kept the base game intact, the changes in the remake are mainly quality of life improvements and aesthetic design differences. Most gamers will find a lot to love in the new Demon’s Souls. I'm excited that more people will get to experience this wonderful game.","The Demon's Souls is a gorgeous technical powerhouse. Fans may differ on stylistic aesthetic choices, but the core game remains the same challenging and precise experience. It's a perfect way to begin a new console generation for the core gaming set, and an all-time classic you will beg your friends to play.","In 11 years that separate the original Demon’s Souls and its remake, Souls game formula didn’t change much – but it definitely hasn’t gone stale. [Issue#250, page 46]","But damn if this doesn't feel like Demon's Souls, an accomplishment in and of itself that feels like a magic trick. Part of what happens when you revisit an older game is having to confront the reality of the time it was developed in, realizing your imagination had been filling in serious nostalgia gaps. How you felt was informing your too-rosy remembrance of what it looked like. Here, Bluepoint tries to bridge that gap with an updated presentation that makes Demon's Souls truly feel like a 2020 game worthy of being a next-generation launch title.

persona-5-royal,,,,,,,,,,"Persona 5 Royal is the ultimate way to experience the renowned game. It may be worth a lower price upgrade if you already have it on the PlayStation 4, but for newcomers, it is hands down the best edition to get. And you should.",,,"Certainly it's difficult to make a strong argument for exactly whom should be buying Persona 5 Royal on PS5. If you've absolutely never played Persona 5 before than that person would be you, although you there is a compelling argument for just buying the PS4 version at a cheaper price anyway. For everyone else that has already sampled the delights of the game on PS4 and PS4 Pro, Persona 5 Royal not only doesn't offer enough to make the leap worthwhile but the lack of charitable continuity when it comes to save files and cross-gen upgrades makes it that much more challenging to provide a reason for its existence in the first place. This should have been a free PS5 patch upgrade, it's that simple.",,,,,,,,,Persona 5 Royal is definitely an amazing role-playing game experience. The story is engaging and most of the characters are fun with colorful personalities to match. The battle system can be deeply engaging and almost a puzzle to figure out how to navigate. Collecting the Personas can be quite addictive as is playing with merging the Personas. This game is a must buy for any JRPG fan.,,,,,,,,,,"The PS5 version of Persona 5 Royal is the best edition of one of the greatest games of the previous generation. However, is a set of DLCs and an upgrade to 60 frames per second worth paying the price the publisher is asking? I don’t think it is. Someone should break into Atlus’s Palace and change the hearts of the management, because this rip-off is distasteful.",,,,,,,,"If you already own Persona 5 Royal on PS4, then, there might not be enough here to convince you to buy it again. It’s a more pleasant, nicer-looking experience, sure, but beyond that it’s exactly the same game. For newcomers though, it should be a no-brainer. One of the best RPGs of the last decade, perhaps of all-time, now looks and plays better than ever before. And while it hardly transforms the experience, the inclusion of a substantial amount of DLC sweetens the deal.","Atlus has undoubtedly created a definitive experience that takes the crown jewel JRPG of the generation. Persona 5 Royal improves on everything the vanilla version was lacking, with new content, gameplay adjustments, and quality of life improvements, whilst telling a compelling narrative with colorful characters. This PlayStation 5 native port may be off-putting to previous owners on PlayStation 4 with no upgrade paths, but the faster load times, silky smooth 60 frames per second, 4K native resolution, and all included DLC make this title a must-play for any JRPG fan.",,,,,,,,,"Persona 5 Royal on PS5 manages to be better than the previous version just for its graphics, performance and additional content, but in the end, it's the same title from 2020. With that in mind, the game becomes a must-buy only for those who still did not have the opportunity to test the PS4 version. If this is not your case, don't invest your money here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Persona 5 Royal takes the formula established by the previous games and refines it to almost perfection. The intricacies of every system in the game, be it social- or combat-related, might be hard to understand at first, but Persona 5 Royal is pretty generous with objective deadlines, as well as tips and hints. However, if you want to get all that the game has to offer in terms of story, that’s a completely different tune. The outstanding soundtrack and visuals, as well as the top-notch combat system, social interactions, great characters and voice acting make Persona 5 Royal a JRPG masterpiece. This is a game that has little to no flaws, so everyone who loves the genre should make the time to play it.",,,,,"With its melding of excellent gameplay systems, married to a truly unmatched sense of style and an iconic soundtrack, Persona 5 Royal is a true work of art — and that makes its publisher's greed all the more shameful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Persona 5 Royal is without a doubt one of the best JRPGs of the past generation that makes the leap to the current gen without losing anything. Being able to play in the best resolutions and running smoothly is more than enough to give it a try if you haven't already. It is one of those games that will leave us delighted with what it offers without expecting it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-+-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Placing a level of sheen on an already stellar effort, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 on PlayStation 5 is arguably the definitive version of the best two skater titles ever released. If you've somehow resisted buying this twin pack thus far, resist no longer. This is as essential as it gets.",,,,,,,,,The fact that the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater franchise has withstood the test of time is a testament to the care that Neversoft put into the original game over two decades ago. If you’re a veteran skater or just someone looking for a fun skating experience and have access to a next-generation console most certainly consider checking out Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2.,,,"Without a doubt, the best thing about the PS5 version of the game is that it allows for cross-gen progression. The process is fairly straightforward - you essentially save and upload your PS4 version, and then download the file onto your PS5 - but it made me incredibly happy that I was able to bring over my custom character and his stats to the PS5 without hassle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 is quite simply the best skateboarding game available right now, irrespective of the format you play it on. Thanks to numerous improvements, however, including DualSense support, the PS5 is undoubtedly the best format to experience it. The visuals are cleaner and more eye-catching than ever, loading times are noticeably reduced, and, if you have a TV capable of it, 120fps support makes the gameplay smoother than a baby’s backside and more responsive than… well, a really responsive thing. The next-gen version of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 isn’t revelatory, but it makes an outstanding game even better. What more could you ask for?",,,,,,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 on PS5 is the same enjoyable skate game, now a little bit better thanks to next gen innovations... but keep in mid that graphically isn't a big jump ahead (it was very good on PS4/One), and it has HDR problems on PS5 and, worst of all, you probably will have to pay again to enjoy it.","Overall, the visual upgrade to 4K and the power of the PS5 take this already great game and add an extra level of immersion to it. Everything that is great in the PS4 version of the game is here, just better and faster. With the haptic feedback only possible with the DualSense, you’ll feel not only more in touch with it, but also more control in the game. Short of an entire remake to take full advantage of the new consoles this is the premium way to play Tony Hawk 1 + 2. While the overall differences between the PS4 and PS5 may be subtle, once you play the PS5 version you won’t want to go back to the other one.",,,,,,,"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 for the PS5 is a great PlayStation game, but not necessarily a great PS5 game. It’s still a ton of fun to play, with no noticeable bugs or glitches. However, the only utilized PS5 feature is improved loading times. Adaptic triggers and haptic feedback felt largely unused, so much so it felt more like I was playing with a PS4 controller. Nonetheless, that doesn’t stop this remake from being amazing --- it’s still a ton of fun to play, and for new players there’s plenty of content to chew through that you won’t necessarily be missing those missed DualSense features.","Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 remains a masterpiece of a remake. The spirit of the first two games is kept alive here, while the presentation puts it at the higher echelon of remakes that have been released thus far. If you never owned the PS4 iteration, then the PS5 version is the perfect way to jump in. If you have a 4K set or a screen with high refresh rates, then the upgrade might also be worth it — more so than the additions of the controller triggers and vibration. If you're going physical on this one, be on the lookout for the Deluxe Edition, as the PS5-only disc is the same price minus the extra cosmetics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, we'd say this is a decent upgrade that makes effective use of PS5's capabilities. However, if you're yet to grab Sony's new machine, the PS4 version will serve you just fine until you do.",,,,,,,,"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 is still a perfect game, and the small PS5 enhancements only serve to make it even better, but don’t expect a drastically different game or experience when jumping to the new console. The PS5 version simply continues to polish something that already gleamed beautifully.",,,"On Playstation 5, Tony Hawk continues where we left him last autumn. Thanks to improved loading times, we can now also enjoy the fluid frame rate, grippy controls and great music faster than ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Around six months since Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 first graced our screens, Vicarious Visions’ reimagining of the famed skateboard series is still as fun, giddy and accessible as it always was. And with the game arriving on new consoles, though this may not be some astonishingly absolute improvement in all corners, the PS5 release especially still offers up noticeable improvements to the experience. Avoiding the peril of subtracting from such nostalgic appeasement, instead adding to it in a way that makes levels feel both original yet familiar all at once. But it’s through the added perks of its improved load times as well as the DualSense controller’s haptic feedback alike where Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 on PS5 results in an even more joyous revisit to one of gaming’s most cherished series.",,,,,,,"The classics are here, all gleamed up for the current gen of consoles.

Aside from expansion ‘Intermission’, the difference between ‘FFVII Remake’ on PS4 and ‘Intergrade’ on PS5 is small, but the graphical upgrade and utilization of the new console’s fast computing power is still big enough to make it the best possible version of this modern day classic.","The main game receives an important graphic and technical update to adapt it to the new generation, but it is in the INTERmission expansion that we find the main attraction of Intergrade. A DLC with a new story line, surprising changes in gameplay and the addition of the Fort Condor minigame. A must for fans of the title.","Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade doesn't just add on to last year’s Final Fantasy VII Remake, but brings it to new heights. Playing the game one year later made us rediscover the overall quality of the battle system as well. Yuffie’s story is much more than just a new standalone chapter, as it enriches the game’s lore and story by depicting the Avalanche headquarters and their members in more detail than before. On new-gen hardware, the game has become even more immersive, resulting in an experience that’s worth going back to even if you’ve already beaten the original remake version.",,Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is a worthy return to Midgar with a number of visual enhancements.

It's not meaningless filler as some DLC packs tend to be, but rather it provides substantial new story content and is a fun time to boot. As for the base game, those that already own the PS4 version can enjoy the free PS5 upgrade, and while they may not necessarily feel like going through the entire game over again on the new console, they can at least use Chapter Select to pop into a few spots and admire the improved visuals and 60 fps gameplay.",,,,,,,"INTERmission is a classy addition to one of last year’s best games, which itself runs a little better now on PS5.

We’re ready to move on from the great city now, but this is a fine farewell party.",,,,"As far as Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade INTERmission goes as a whole, I'm really glad it exists. To be frank I wouldn't mind seeing another one of these, say for Vincent, at some point.",,,,,,,"Final Fantasy VII Remake, only a year old, gets a next-gen remake, and the results are visually stunning.

Bouncy and full of life, Yuffie brings some much needed levity to the proceedings, shining a new light on the game as a whole.",,,,"Final Fantasy VII Remake just got even better. With the new options in the free PS5 upgrade, you can choose between graphics and performance. The new DLC adds about 5 hours of gameplay starring Yuffie for a reasonable price. It's long enough and it adds enough, but just not enough to buy the entire package anew if needed.","It's not a huge difference over the main game, but all the improvements from Intergrade are a nice addition, and the perfect way to replay FFVII Remake. INTERmission is just the cherry on top... And a BIG tease that will leave you longing for Part II.",,"InterMISSION, the episode starring Yuffie, is worth it if you are fan of Final Fantasy franchise and you want to know the new narrative ties it will have with future installments; but it is true that Square Enix could taking it out for free or for half the price, considering that it can be completed in just 5 hours.",,,,,,"Intergrade is a decent upgrade to a fantastic game. While some of the new features like haptic feedback leave a lot to be desired, the INTERmission DLC is a blast with some truly incredible gameplay, music, and characters that makes this worth getting if you already own a PS5.","Overall, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is a solid package. It's not quite worth buying at full price if you've already played the original, but the upgraded original game and the DLC combine to create an excellent experience. Remake still holds up as a really fun game a year later, and Yuffie's side story shows that the developers still have plenty of ideas on how to keep the combat fresh for a sequel. If this is your first time playing Final Fantasy VII Remake, then Intergrade is absolutely the version to get.","Episode Intermission is a must-have addition for fans of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, with a joyful character, new fighting style and a small but important story. The original has since been polished up extremely well and runs smoothly on the PlayStation 5.",,,,,Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is the best way to experience the monumental ARPG and its Episode Intermission is a top-notch piece of DLC that's much more riveting than I was anticipating.

Not fair, Square Enix.",,,,"Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is the best way to experience the return of Cloud and company. Remake remains a game of ups and downs in terms of quality, but by the time the credits roll, its most memorable moments shine through — of which there are many. Meanwhile, Episode INTERmission won't blow anyone's mind, but it's an enjoyable adventure that slots neatly into the existing story, and fans won't want to miss it.","It is a pleasant surprise to find in Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade a game that takes advantage of the new generation of consoles, in this case, the PS5. The game loads amazingly fast, both the performance and the graphics options look flawless and the Yuffie expansion is an entertaining addition to the product.","Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade shows the correct way to conclude a console generation’s journey. But beware - the Intermission episode won’t really satisfy the hunger for the next instalment - on the contrary, your impatience will probably only increase.","As a big fan, I might have hoped for a little more content, but Intermission is an unmissable experience and the ultimate setup for what's to come in the second part of Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

In 2029, when the second half of the remake finally comes out, Square Enix will have (hopefully) figured out how to incorporate the DualSense 5 controller a little better, but by then, we might be talking about the DualSense 6, and the game will be uploaded to and played solely within our minds, so it may not matter anyway.","Intergrade is the best version of a fantastic remake, and the extra episode, INTERmission, is a welcome addition that expands the story and leaves it ready for the second episode.","Not only improving on the visuals and giving players a much requested Photo Mode, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade also adds the stellar Yuffie focused Intermission DLC that is an absolute must play for fans of the original and new game alike.","You should absolutely get Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. It’s easy to be critical and nitpick, but it’s worth remembering we’re looking at the DLC for one of the best and most-loved games of the PS4. The PS5 upgrade for Intergrade looks and feels incredible, and the chance to play as Yuffie is warmly received, especially when she completely changes the tone to something more light-hearted.

I know that sentence has a lot of ""well DUH"" energy, but it's the truth; at its core this is an enhanced version of one of 2020's best games. From visuals to framerate, Intergrade improves upon the original, with some scenes really popping off of the screen thanks to the PlayStation 5's prowess.

It is packed with people you recognize and, unless you went all in on Compilation of FFVII, don’t. Its fundamental gameplay is tight and does enough that it engages you with what-ifs.

It all coalesces into a thrilling and heartfelt experience that will satisfy longtime fans of the franchise, and while I do wish there was a bigger emphasis on story and character, at times, I still had a blast returning to this world and spending time with this delightful duo, and Remake's second chapter can't get here soon enough.","Final Fantasy VII Remake is a massive endeavor that I fear we may never see the end of, but the ride so far has been fun. I really hope the next chapters don’t span years in development as the original is still one of my favorite RPGs of all-time. I would love to see this end before the end of the PS5-era, but I somehow feel like that is asking a lot.

Anyone who held off until now to get the game will be happy to see just how much more of Midgar’s world is showcased in Remake versus the original release in ’97, and those wanting a faster-paced gameplay experience will love the action-centric take on FF VII’s ATB system.

To be honest, sometimes the game looks way too conservative in its alterations decisions and, being exclusive for the current console generation, also falls short on some technical aspects. That said, the final result is respectful to the legacy of one of the best survival horror games ever made. It doesn’t feel like a rerun, but achieves to offer a refreshingly scary experience, as if it were the first time.",,,"Dead Space is a quality remake. It brings another dimension to the 2008 game by bringing in clever new ideas that produce an even more oppressive experience and controlled, more modern, more fluid gameplay.

The story remains largely true to the original, but in terms of gameplay, minor and major tweaks have been made. The game is more challenging due to new puzzles and there is an extra layer of unpredictability on top that keeps you constantly nervous and alert. If we may offer one tip: don't play this game too late at night if you still want a good night's sleep.","Dead Space remake is one of the best remakes we ever had the pleasure to play.

As a player who never played the original, this remake feels like the definitive introduction to the franchise. I’m clamoring for more of Isaac’s story, and even perhaps beyond.","Dead Space is a triumphant remake that draws strength from familiarity instead of allowing its archaic origins to become a vice. This is now the definitive version of Isaac Clarke’s first chapter, one that doesn’t aim to reinvent his character, but to outfit him with a more relatable and nuanced arc that will likely set the stage for other games to come. Improved performance, a greater incentive to explore, and a crux of combat and scares combine to turn what was once a horror classic into a modern gem. Shame it’s a bit too easy, though.","Again, it feels like we're well-served for horror game remakes at the moment, but Motive Studio's Dead Space is a horror remake done right. It really is a sublime mix of fresh and familiar, and it's freaking terrifying in its loud and quieter moments.

AlL in all, it's a noticeable overall upgrade.","It’s a solid remake that brings back the memorable experience but also enhances and modernizes it through a surprising multitude of subtle changes, giving Isaac’s tale a chance to delight new generations of players. The team at EA Motive clearly understood why Visceral’s survival horror was great and while they rebuilt it from scratch, they managed to retain the most precious ingredient – the tense, overwhelming atmosphere, now even more palpable thanks to stunning lighting and great 3D sound. However, while I did not mind backtracking and repetitiveness 15 years ago, they did bother me now, especially since new optional activities force you to run around the ship even more.",,"It feels great to just dive back into the USG Ishimura, though.

While much of the game will be familiar to those who have played the original, the meaningful updates and additions go a long way to keep the experience feeling fresh, modern and unpredictable. So, whether you’re already a Dead Space fan or new to the series, this is well worth your time and money – as long as you have the nerves for it.

There are plenty of reasons to go on another trip on the USG Ishimura.",,"Dead Space is more than just the fantasy of any fan of the original game – it feels like the developers once again wanted to prove that their game is the gold standard in its genre. The fine folks at Motive Studio tweaked the experience in the right places to make the game feel fresh without weighing it down with unnecessary bling. Of course, there are still elements that could have benefitted from more attention like all the end game content, especially the final boss fight, but once again Dead Space offers an experience that is more than the sum of its parts and reconfirms its status as the king of the genre.","Dead Space Remake is more than just a remake, it's a whole new game. Motive has done a titanic job to give a second life to one of the masterpieces of the survival horror genre. Not only its graphics are a real slap in the face and its sound design is absolutely fantastic, but he few gameplay adjustments and the work on the level design offer a real added value.

The visual enhancements don’t stop there, also translating to clever planning of scares and moments of tension as you wander the Ishimura Station halls. It’s in some of this revisiting of those beloved halls that you’ll notice some dated gameplay design points not quite ironed over. However, it’s hardly a blip in the radar when you consider the other mountain of quality of life improvements to make this Isaac Clarke’s bloodiest and most delightful foray yet, with new tidbits to uncover and stellar survival horror to engage in. Dead Space has some life in it yet.","Dead Space is one of the true legends of the survival horror genre, and EA Motive’s new remake does the original game full justice while also introducing a variety of fantastic new additions and reworkings. Other than some slight disappointment in its visuals on a technical (but certainly not artistic or atmospheric) level, this is a remake that finds a near-perfect balance between retaining the heart and soul of its predecessor and reanimating its body in some unexpected (but positive) ways.","Technically impressive remake of a modern horror classic: This Dead Space feels brutally good, sounds strong and gets on your last nerve.",,"Dead Space feels like a new game with all the added improvements like great graphics, gameplay and last but not least great sound. Whether or not you enjoyed the original game, entering the halls of the USG Ishimura will give you enough terror to make you think it's worth it.",,EA Motive showed that they can do the kind of work we are used to from studios like Bluepoint. We are talking about a phenomenal remake that retouches the necessary parts to make a classic game come back taking advantage of the good things that have been improved over the years.,"Dead Space remains one of the best survival horror games ever, and the 15 years that have passed are hardly felt at all in terms of structure, gameplay, combat-system and setting. If all remakes were like this...",,"Rather than reinvent the wheel, Motive made Dead Space look nicer, play better, and preserved the core of the experience. Its new flourishes add to that enjoyment instead of subtracting. This remake respects and polishes up my memories of Isaac’s first encounter with the necromorphs without making me miss the original version. It also acts as the perfect entry point for newcomers since it feels on par with today’s titles. I hope this exceptional revision signals to EA that Dead Space has plenty of gas in the tank and becomes a harbinger for more horrifying stories in this universe.",,"As a returning fan that played the original countless times, Dead Space in 2023 is just about as perfect of a remake as we could ask for. It runs with the old saying “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” formula, but the developers at Motive Studio add some subtle improvements and quality-of-life updates to justify the existence of this remake. Even when I know what’s coming, I can’t help but be drawn into the atmospheric tension that had me adore the horror classic of 2008. Dead Space is a prime example of how a remake should be done and unfortunately for you, your neighbours will hear you scream.","Dead Space kicks off 2023’s AAA horror lineup with a seamless, masterful execution of action and frights.","The remake of Dead Space follows the track of the original game, obviously (and considerably) improving it from a technical point of view and adding or modifying some gameplay elements. The result is a sci-fi horror adventure that will please series veterans and thrill-seeking newcomers alike.",,"Everything good about Dead Space 2023’s basic gameplay, combat, and narrative is a result of what Dead Space 2008 built. Most of what this remake adds is either less appealing artistic alterations or side content that generally amounts to unnecessary padding, and quite frankly I’d have been more interested in a remaster than a glitchy new take that’s less enjoyable and costs more. When you add the repulsive context of EA benefiting from a series it once destroyed right down to the developer, you get a game that leaves a sour bloody taste, even if it’s an acceptable mimicry of its predecessor...Dead Space 2008 is fifteen quid on digital storefronts.",,,,,,"Motive delivers the best possible version of Dead Space. The USG Ishimura is terrifying, and the way the Forstbite Engine is playing with light and shadows will give you nightmares for weeks. Beyond the technical aspects, improvements to the gameplay are sparse and the experience is about the same as it was 15 years ago. That’s not necessarily a bad thing.","This new version of Dead Space is the gold standard for what a remake can be. Remaining faithful to the original game while also creating meaningful additions to exploration and character interactions. It’s perfect for either new players or those who have trekked through the Ishimura countless times. After being dormant for nearly a decade, Dead Space has finally returned, and it’s better than ever.",,"Dead Space 2023 is a familiar, yet fresh return to the classic, visually and mechanically polishing the things that made the 2008 game amazing while reworking a number of key points to make it one of the most impressive and exciting modern horror experiences I have ever played.",Dead Space is a remarkable achievement in design on all fronts. A loving and intelligent remake that reminds players of what has been lost in AAA games and what can be found again if you just know where to look.,,,"For likely many others and I, the only hopes for this Dead Space remake were to be able to play through the game once more (hopefully with a jump scare or two) in a way that didn't feel ancient and clunky. The Dead Space remake far outstrips those minimal expectations, and though it may be premature a cliché to say it's raised the bar for remakes, it's certainly established a dominant foothold in 2023 and in the upcoming string of horror remakes fans have to look forward to. It's again not perfect, but it strives to be better than the original, and that's something other remakes should look to copy.",,,,,"For anyone who’s yet to play one of gaming’s horror greats, the new take on Dead Space is a fairly definitive version of the experience. Its limb-carving combat and claustrophobic atmosphere still outclass its peers 15 years later, and that fact is only emphasized with some smart adjustments. If you’ve played the 2008 version to death, though, nothing here is likely to deepen your relationship with it. It’s a remake for remake’s sake.",,,"This is a very good—in fact, we’d argue, the best—version of something that was already a very good video game. (One that, in a nice change of pace from the typical remake trend, has not been remastered into the ground already.) If you played Dead Space 15 years ago and loved it, you’ve got a beautiful, improved version of it to come home to. And if you never played it, you’ve got a genuinely great experience ahead of you, a winning blend of horror and action that at no point feels needlessly beholden to its own past.",Dead Space remains a relic from an age of self-contained prestige shooters that almost certainly isn’t coming back; I’m not even sure Motive’s approach would work for remaking the series’ other games. But none of that diminishes the sheer ridiculous pleasure of ripping up a zombie with a sawblade and stomping it for loot.,,,"The new Dead Space is a mostly-successful revival of a survival horror landmark, offering atmospheric new visuals and a series of precision updates to combat, level layouts, and the game’s scary bits that ought to surprise and excite veteran engineers. That said, there was room for Motive Studio to push ever further, as some game elements still feel a bit dated. Dead Space should satisfy long-suffering fans of the franchise, but compared to the latest, greatest AAA horror competition, it’s no longer a cut above.",,,,,,,,,,,"Dead Space kicked ass in 2008, and this version kicks ass in 2023. It’s spooky, and it feels good to tear apart ugly dudes. What else is there to say? I hope the same team gets a chance to apply this same treatment for Dead Space 2, though perhaps with the confidence to put more of their own bloody stamp on it. And if that’s a problem, screw it—just let them make their own Dead Space, pull some elements from the sequels, and chart a new path.",,,,,,The Dead Space remake proves that a timeless game built on a solid foundation can feel as fresh in 2023 as it felt in 2008.,"Dead Space Remake is one of the best remakes we've ever received. The technological, audio, and graphical improvements all do wonders for the level of immersion that this game relies on, and the quality and polish is so welcome when considering some of the other 'finished' games that we've seen as of late.","Despite some shortcomings, the remake of Dead Space is the best thing a fan of the series could've asked for, but it's also a great experience for a wider group of horror and sci-fi enthusiasts. Isaac's adventures are still exceptional, with excellent atmosphere, story, and enjoyable gameplay - and all of this is even more intense than before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its sheer absurdity had me laughing out loud on a few occasions but I also wish there was more to it such as additional gameplay elements other than simply walking through doors.",,,,,,,,"Visually it's definitely an improvement, although it's behind the curve by modern standards. It makes up for that by doubling the size of the game with all-new content, alterations to existing endings, and more that fans will adore. If you've played The Stanley Parable before, Ultra Deluxe gives you lots of reasons to revisit the experience. If this'll be your first time, well, lucky you. Once the element of surprise is gone, there's little reason to return — but while it lasts, this is easily among gaming's most unique and memorable journeys.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A humorous tumble down the videogaming rabbit hole, The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe gives us pointed, witty observations about game design.

[Polygon Recommends]",,,,,,,,The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is an essential gaming experience. It’s simultaneously a hilariously absurd adventure that can be enjoyed on its own merits and an insightful examination of storytelling in gaming. The acutely self-aware new content reframes the original game to give it refreshing new purpose alongside a cluster of new barbs aimed at the flaws in modern gaming. A must play.,,,,"The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe is a conversion, remake, update, sequel and denial of the original work. All together. A title that nine years ago changed the videogame landscape and that today returns not to complete its mission, but more to reflect on itself, on what it represented and on what it left to the industry. Some passages of the ""New Content"" are hallucinating and ingenious, and blend with the original content in a masterly way. In short, The Stanley Parable is one of those experiences that anyone should play at least once in their life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Insanely fun and clever walking simulator with fresh content that brings a new dimension to the original adventure and pushes the video game medium forward.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disco-elysium-the-final-cut,,,,,,,Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is a Role Playing masterpiece and the best choice for those who never forgot the memories of Planescape: Torment.,"Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is a fantastic game, especially now the major bugs seem to have been squished. It's one of the most immersive games I've ever played, has great presentation across the board and once all the issues are patched out it'll be superb and unmissable.",,,,,"There are so many aspects of its design in which Disco Elysium stands unmatched. Boasting unparalleled player agency, the sort of writing that makes me deeply jealous and a cast of characters that are resolutely unforgettable, Disco Elysium is easily one of the most intelligent and fascinating RPGs ever made. However, in its current form, the presence of game breaking bugs that prevent you from finishing missions, levels a near fatal blow at Disco Elysium that not even its towering brilliance is sufficient to overcome. I'm sure there's a timeline where all the bugs have been fixed and I'm playing Disco Elysium for the first time, awarding it the 10/10 score it deserves. Right now, this isn't that timeline.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Bugs aside, it is an astoundingly well put together experience, balancing player choice, opportunities for chaos, deep introspection, and a thorough exploration of politics. That’s on top of the sordid and twisted murder at the narrative’s heart, too. I’m not necessarily a fan of all of the design choices - it’s often both too open ended and too restrictive - but I understand them all, and I wish it was less of an exception to the rule. I can’t fault its narrative, or even its design, despite my disagreements. If someone told me they consider it a perfect game, I wouldn’t have anything besides personal preference to come back at them. But with the fiddly game design likely to block off even more players than the already niche themes, I can’t help but wish a game so focused on socialism could have been more welcoming to the masses.",,,,,,,,,,,"Vast as an oceanic soul of late-stage alcoholic, Disco Elysium remains one of the most sincere, deep and meaningful stories about destructive nostalgia, communism, and a true unending love.",,,,,,"Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is a game that had me on the edge of my seat with my knuckles clenched just as often as it made me laugh out loud or well up unexpectedly. It's a game that asks you to make some hard decisions and face challenging realities, all the while reminding us every step of the way that who we are today is much, much more important than the person we were the day before. It is, and I mean this without a whiff of hyperbole, a masterpiece.","Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is quite simply like nothing else in the medium. If you missed it on PC, it’s absolutely worth picking it up on console and investing some time and effort in its wonderfully complex world.",,,,,"Disco Elysium is pure role. If you did not play it in its day, you should give it the opportunity, since it is one of the most in-depth and immersive RPGs of recent years thanks to its narrative development and its mixture of concepts and ideas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If Disco Elysium The Final Cut would have been launched a bit later, with the subsequent patches already incorporated there would have been little to complain about. It is a masterpiece that needs to be played by every RPG fan out there. Despite the state the game was released in, the developers went through a lot of trouble to bring the experience they promised. Right now Disco Elysium The Final Cut is damn close to that vision. It is not often that I can forgive a messy launch, but the fixes that patched up things quite quickly and the experience itself outweighs any issues that are already in the past. If there was any game from the ones presented in a while that I wholeheartedly recommend, this is the one.",,,,,"Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is an exceptional achievement in role-playing. Expertly written, it's an utterly engrossing detective drama at its best, and a fantastic sense of humour keeps the whole thing grounded. Its deliberately slow and methodical pacing won't be for everyone, but once you're invested, it's incredibly hard to put down. A haunting video game, for all the right reasons.","Disco Elysium: The Final Cut adds good production values and more enjoyable moments to this solid indie game from two years ago. It is a unique experience that any gamer should try. However, the PS5 version had few adjustments and was initially buggy. Play it here only if you don't have a PC that can run it.",,,"A major update to the intricately plotted and highly detailed RPG, that gives players more of what they loved in the original release and the same amount of what they didn’t.","The universe of Disco Elysium is finally opening up to the console public, in a version fully translated into French and fully dubbed into English. If one feels a few shortcomings of porting problems (not very intuitive controls, long loading times and some sound bugs), Disco Elysium is still a unique experience that it is good to find in a more complete version than that of origin. Always so essential.",,,"Even with the handful of bugs this is a unique experience that is very easy to recommend. It’s an amazing RPG with an absolutely stunning amount of depth for a game where you’re mostly just talking to people. Both the story and cast of characters are highly memorable and no two players will have the same experience. It’s really easy to see why PC gamers have been raving about Disco Elysium, this truly is a must-play experience.",,,,,,,"There’s a shocking amount of depth to the branching choices and skill checks that turn success and failure into your own personal tale of investigation. [Issue#1, p.90]",,,,,,,,"The writing, world and systems elevates Disco Elysium into one of the most deep RPGs in existence. This is an evergreen title that will be talked about for years to come. The initial release earned a never-ending stream of accolades for good reason. The fact that more people can now play it, and everyone gets more content, is just awesome. It cannot be described as flawless as there are obvious growing pains. Still, with the sheer breadth of the game and the value to be found here, Disco Elysium: The Final Cut deserves its place in the pantheon of the greatest digital role-playing games ever made.",,"The definite version of one of the best RPGs lands on PS5 improving many aspects of the original, but also suffering from technical issues that, we hope, will be fixed soon.",,"Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is a work of genius. I'm planning to immediately replay it, simply because I don't want it to be over yet. The story is absolutely captivating, the world is filled to the brim with detail, and the characters and their motivations are remarkably well thought out. It made me laugh at absurd moment, made me gasp with the twists in the story, and I've developed an attachment to the main character's partner, Kim Kitsuragi, and his endless patience with me shooting finger guns at him as much as possible. Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is a masterwork and you are doing yourself a disservice if you miss it.",,,,"Disco Elysium was already an excellent game when it first launched, and with The Final Cut, it's been made even better.",,"Disco Elysium is a masterpiece, but this has long been known. The Final Cut is its definitive version, with new content that does nothing but increase the value of the package.","With a unique formula and an absolutely masterful writing, Disco Elysium: The Final Cut manages to compensate for most of its shortcomings with an assortment of additions that enhance the merits of the developer's creative vision, making the title an indispensable purchase for the lovers of the genre.",,,,,,"An innovative, wonderful game that is further improved in its “Final Cut” version, but is somewhat hampered in the console version by its poor gamepad controls and the annoyingly small text.",,,,,"Disco Elysium is a unique blend of noir-detective fiction, traditional pen-and-paper RPGs, and a large helping of existentialist theory. Its twisting plot, cast of memorable characters, and sheer depth of choice combine to create an experience that begs to be savoured. It hits on every single one of the marks it sets out to achieve and left me yearning to spend more time in its world. Removing any of the minor gripes I had with the original by adding new quests and a full cast of well-voiced characters, The Final Cut elevates Disco Elysium from an already phenomenal RPG to a true must-play masterpiece.",,,,,,,,,,"More quests, full voice-overs and lots of finetuning.

Like a huge, epic novel, the game can at times be enigmatic, opaque, and a little too long. But as is often the case for those kinds of stories, it’s well worth slogging through the boring stuff to see the game all the way to its fantastic end. I’m glad I read this one all the way through.",,,,,,,,,,"The fact that Disco Elysium - The Final Cut is now in a good state makes me incredibly happy because it means I can scream from the rooftops how much I want people to play this game. Not only did its gameplay mechanics surprise me with just how much variety they offer, and how much fun they are to mess around with, but its world, story, and characters are second to none in the world of gaming. I haven't stopped thinking about Disco Elysium since I put it down, and I am very excited to go back to Revachol and craft my detective's identity all over again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"While Disco Elysium: The Final Cut won’t appeal to everyone, those that do enjoy it will sing its praises for a long time to come.

Actually, the Special Edition has much more going for it, including a new difficulty level, new rendering modes (up to 4K 30 fps with ray tracing), and the ability to play as Vergil. Sadly, the new character doesn’t come with his own levels. I also need to point out fps drops in the 120 Hz mode, and lackluster use of DualSense’s features.

Including all of the additional content released for the original version and more, it makes a great game even better, it’s as simple as that. It’s a shame that ray tracing comes at such a cost when playing at 4K, but it still looks glorious without it, and if you want to make use of Turbo or Legendary Dark Knight Modes they can’t be used in conjunction with it anyway. The real draw for most, though, will be the chance to once again take control of Vergil, and he doesn’t disappoint.

The gameplay is more accessible than ever, while the story has reached a new plateau on Mount Convoluted. Players who missed it the first time will be thrilled, but even experienced fans will have good reasons to double dip. The features included make this an excellent Special Edition while being a decent PS5 release. I’m not so invested I want to go back and play the games I missed, though I am glad I came back to the series. If smooth gameplay is your yardstick, then this is the definitive version for you. On the other hand, there are better graphical show pieces for the PS5 out there.

The narrative is amazing, the relationship between Joel and Ellie is wholesome and it all culminates into a satisfying story that will bring tears to your eyes. However, I do not recommend the remake. Even though there are extensive graphical enhancements, 60FPS support, DualSense support and a variety of accessibility options, none of this justifies the admission price. And, above all, there was really no need for this remake, the original is perfect as it is and available on PS Plus. Skip it and wait for a fat discount if you are keen to try it.","The Last of Us is irrefutably one of the best games of the PS3 era but it's beginning to feel of its time – and beneath its gorgeous next-gen glow-up, Part 1 is still, essentially, the same game. Which wouldn't be a problem at all were it not for that troublesome next-gen asking price.",,"There's no denying that The Last of Us Part I might be a tough sell to folks who expected a reworked content offering in line with the overhauled audiovisual presentation and other technical advances. For those with accessibility needs, the lucky few who have yet to experience The Last of Us at all or even just the number of players who want to immerse themselves in the ultimate form of Naughty Dog's opus, The Last of Us Part I makes a more than compelling case for its existence and stands shoulder to shoulder with the best games on PS5.","The Last of Us Part 1 is a truly stunning remake that significantly heightens the immersion of one of the best games ever made with denser environments, more realistic gameplay, and beautiful remastered visuals.",,"The Last of Us: Part I updates the original adventure of Joel and Ellie in audiovisual and playable terms, beyond what many of us expected when its development was announced. Enhancing its emotional side and improving the gameplay. In addition, it comes with some other juicy extra for anyone who likes to delve into the development of the work. So this version becomes, in its own right, the best way to enjoy The Last of Us and Left Behind.","Naughty Dog is by no means a one trick pony. With ‘The Last of Us’ and ‘Uncharted’, it is responsible for two of the best game series of recent years. It is also far from being the only developer to spread the same game at full price over three console generations. Consider, for example, Rockstar, which also wants to market ‘Grand Theft Auto V’ to as many gamers as it can in the same way. For a game of this exceptionally high level, that's not even a bad thing, although we'd rather see their focus shift to ‘GTA VI’ or, who knows, ‘The Last of Us: Part III’.","An unnecesary remake, perhaps, but a pleasurable one and a good way to discover a masterpiece.","The main changes to The Last of Us Part 1 are in the character’s facial expressions and accessibility options, while the rest can be summed up as “extra features”. Compared with the original game, some scenes have actually decreased in quality and I came across bugs as well, which makes it a remake that comes with both advantages and disadvantages. While a conservative remake indeed, in the end the appeal of the original shines through.","The work here should be used as a showcase for how to redevelop legacy products for a new generation. I would have liked to have seen it priced slightly lower, as I fear some gamers may be put off paying full-whack for a nine-year-old storyline. That said, if you really want to see what the PS5 is capable of when pushed, this is your game. And if you’re new to this series, this must be your next purchase.","The Last of Us Part I is a great remake. It's not a job like Final Fantasy VII Remake or Resident Evil 2, and that's fine. It is a different experience. For everyone who loved the original game, returning to this adventure, especially with the sequel in mind, is a very worthwhile feeling, while everyone who plans to experience Joel and Ellie's journey for the first time through this version, you will have in your hands the definitive version of the best Naughty Dog game.","In many cases, it’s hard to step back to a older game from a previous generation when you are spoiled with the latest release such as The Last of Us Part II. To be able to go back to the original The Last of Us with a very close visual retelling to the top notch sequel is nothing short of magnificent.","In some instances, a remake can feel like a brand new game, but that isn’t entirely the case here. The Last of Us Part 1 is no doubt a better-looking game and the DualSense functionality adds some nice immersive touches to the gameplay, but it doesn’t feel fundamentally different. There’s an exceptional game on display but it was exceptional back in 2013 and 2014 for the remaster. As a result, interest in the game is going to be all over the place. Some will see it as a cash-grab, others will be happy it exists for the new fans that will come from the HBO series, and specific fans will appreciate yet another opportunity to journey with Joel and Ellie in an experience that is one of PlayStation’s best.","The Last of Us Part 1 is the definitive version of one of our medium’s defining works. Nine years ago Naughty Dog crafted a masterpiece. Now, they have updated it for a slightly more modern sensibilities, putting Part 1 in line with The Last of Us Part 2. The wealth of accessibility options remove numerous barriers of entry for players so that an even wider audience can appreciate this story of loss and triumph. The emotional gut punches sting even harder with overhauled visuals, bringing these tragic characters closer than ever to their astounding real-life performances. The Last of Us Part 1 is the timeless game we have all loved for years, now shining in an even brighter light.",,"The Last of Us Part 1 is, perhaps more than anything, a gorgeous visual love letter to its biggest fans, not to mention a welcoming set of open arms for the inevitable stream of new ones who will arrive to the game via the upcoming Last of Us TV Show from HBO next year. Judged in isolation, that's far from a bad thing. But in the context of an industry where remakes are continuing to push the boundaries of the art of restoration, Part 1 struggles to escape the shadow of feeling like a bit of a missed opportunity.",,"For players who adore the series and want to experience Joel and Ellie’s adventure remade for PS5, or for those who were unable to play the original due to a lack of accessibility options, The Last of Us Part 1 is a must-play game. However, for those who already own the remaster, the price tag may be too much to swallow.","The Last of Us is back with the original game that received some audiovisual overhaul, but nothing really new for the players that already played it earlier. The story is still good, puzzles are still annoying, and there are even some new bugs.","$70 is a steep mountain to climb. But, if you want to play the very best version of one of the greatest games that has ever been made, then The Last Of Us Part 1 is a triumph.","A ten for one of the best games in history. An eight and a half scoring only what this game is supposed to be as a remake of The Last of Us released 10 years ago. If it is your first approach to the saga, getting to this game directly on PS5 should be a unique experience. If you arrive from PS3 without having played the remastering you will notice a good jump. But if you come from PS4 and, especially from PS4 Pro, the change is not going to be so exaggerated.","The Last of Us Part I is the best way to experience the wonderful story initially told in 2013. However, the original game, and especially its remaster, stood the test of time really well, so it’s difficult to justify remaking it so soon without substantial improvements to the gameplay and selling it at this price.",,"While Last of Us still has some of the same issues the original debuted with in 2013, the PS5 version (and likely the upcoming PC port, based on Sony's past efforts) is the best way to play it to date. [Review in Progress]","The Last of Us Part 1 is the definitive way to experience the original story and Left Behind. However, it’s hard to recommend it over the PS4 remaster. I appreciate all the work that went into enhancing the visual and audio fidelity and gameplay. However, it’s just not $50 worth of improvement, and the lack of new content means you’re not missing out too much if you decide to go cheaper.",,"The Last of Us Part I masterfully recaptures what made the original release so special, and thanks to the improved flow of both visuals and gameplay, the journey is better than ever.","Nothing’s wrong with paying a high price to gild the lily — but nothing’s wrong with not wanting to do so, either. I think The Last of Us Part 1 will make a great addition to the casual TLOU fan’s library when it inevitably goes on sale and maybe the PC players when it launches on that platform as well.","The Last of Us Part 1 doesn’t create any lasting memories about the experiences that weren’t already there from the beginning. For that reason, my thoughts about the game’s existence as a product remain dubious. But as a creative work in and of itself, The Last of Us is still exceptional, and I’m happy to have had reason to experience it again, in a new context and an updated format.","With this remake, Naughty Dog has made one of the best games of all time even better. While you may look at screenshots or snippets of video footage and think that it looks and plays just like you remember it, go back to an older version and you'll realise just how much work has been done here. Yes, The Last of Us Remastered still holds up well, and you can stick with it if you like, but for newcomers and ardent fans The Last of Us Part I is a treat that's worth every penny. It would be one thing if this emotional rollercoaster was just as captivating now as it was nine years ago. But in fact, it's even more so. And that's an impressive achievement.","Naughty Dog delivers again with its timeless masterclass narrative experience, this time rebuilt from the ground up following contemporary gaming standards. With modern graphics and unparalleled performance, The Last of Us Part I is the definitive way to enjoy the multilayered and complex story of Joel and Ellie. It remains a genre-bending action survival game that challenges the status-quo by weaving together multiple elements. An expanded array of accessibility options, gameplay modifiers, and extra modes allows this remake to be experienced by anyone from any background and that’s not an easy feat.","When the credits rolled on both The Last of Us Part I and Left Behind , I was left with a burning desire to jump straight into Part II - which tells me that Part I succeeded in exactly what it set out to do. I became completely reinvested in the franchise. Fans will find no better way to experience this story, and first-time players are likely to discover a new all-time favourite.","The Last of Us Part I is a technological marvel, making Naughty Dog's classic story of survival better than it has ever been before. The visuals are sublime as is the audio, and all of the other changes make this well worth playing all over again.",,"The Last of Us Part 1 is a questionable remake of the beloved PS3 game. While the improvements are there, they come in small forms. For new players, this is the way to go, but fans of the original should probably wait for a price cut because the small improvements definitely do not justify the price.","The Last of Us is still a masterpiece, and the PS5 remake looks truly ""next gen"". There are some gameplay improvements and new game modes, but it is not enough to buy the game for the third time if we already played the original and the PS4 remaster.",,,The Last of Us Part 1 is an outstanding remake on the PlayStation 5 that is not only beautiful to play but filled with emotion.,"Although it doesn't bring as many new features as one might expect from a remake, The Last of Us Part I is an absolute and sublime spectacle from start to finish. It retains all the best qualities that made it aN absolute success in its original release and it improves on the technical details that add value to this visceral and impactful journey.",,,"I love Joel and Ellie's story, but it was so intensive that I didn't need to go through it again. However, I envy those who will get to know this game now for the very first time. The Last of Us: Part I is a terrific ""remaster of a remaster"" that guarantees an even better and more immersive experience.","As a game, The Last of Us: Part 1 still deserves a high score after all these years, but I give that score hesitantly, as I am acutely aware that previous releases offer more content and that this release was not created for those who have already played through and enjoyed the game in the past, but rather to welcome in new players or for those who wish to harness the full power of their PS5. While this is the most technically impressive version of The Last of Us that we will likely ever get, it is anchored down by its previous releases, while simultaneously missing important components those versions had, namely the superb multiplayer. Despite some interesting bonus features, new cosmetic items, vastly improved AI, and a few quality-of-life changes, there may not be enough here to justify the purchase for anybody except newcomers. That said, the impressively robust suite of accessibility options is a welcome addition worthy of praise and will hopefully provide an opportunity for a new generation of fans to experience this story.","That leads to The Last of Us Part I being both the best version of the game and also extremely difficult to recommend unless money is not a concern. The Last of Us has aged well enough that you don't lose a ton playing the Remastered version, unlike the similar remake Demon's Souls, which took a cult PS3 game that many people had never played and gave it a modern updated release. If you're willing to wait for a price drop or sale, Part I becomes far more appealing because it is a wonderful improvement to an already impressive game. Aside from cost, there's no reason to go back to the older versions, and The Last of Us remains one of the best games in the Sony library.","The Last of Us Part 1 is an almost exact copy of the original, but according to today's technical standards. Some will see it as a lazy remake with virtually no adjustments, others will be happy that Naughty Dog stays true to the source material. We can argue endlessly about whether the remake is necessary, but at least we don't have to argue about which version of this modern classic is better.","The Last of Us Part I is a great game. We can't deny all the technical work behind it because it is excellent, but at the same time, the gameplay experience is similar to the one of 2013. There are a lot of aspects that I wish were better and there are a lot of others that, having played part two, I can't get out of my head.","The Last of Us Part I is, for all intents and purposes, the same The Last of Us that you know. It doesn’t take liberties to completely reshape the experience and nor should it. It does, however, smartly enhance the original’s combat through A.I. advancements, and drags the original’s production values over the line to create a product that can stand unified with its more polished sequel. The Last Of Us: Part I is without doubt the most definitive version of The Last of Us on the market.",,"The Last of Us Part 1 proves to be a visual and technical treat on the PS5, but still plays just like the original.","Playing The Last of Us Part I made me acquire a newfound appreciation for its sequel because even though it's a great game with incredible characters, it actually feels overwhelmingly dated compared to Part II. You have to love those graphics, though; holy heck!","The Last Of Us Part I looks stunning. It's amazing to see how beautiful the game is on the PS5, how well it uses the console's new features and, of course, the groundbreaking accessibility options. But don't get your hopes up on improved gameplay or level design. It feels like the same game that you played almost ten years ago.","The Last of Us never needed fixing. Everything from combat to crafting has aged remarkably well. Still, it never hurts to polish perfection. And this beautifully enhanced edition works hard to ensure Naughty Dog’s masterpiece will remain my favourite video game for some time to come.",,"No matter where you stand in the debate, The Last of Us Part 1 is a real punch in the gut. With an outstanding technical performance, a remarkable overhaul of an outdated gameplay, a sublimated atmosphere, even more poignant cinematics and more realistic environments, the remake is more striking and visceral than ever. Naughty Dog offers a familiar and yet fresh look at this cult game. A full-fledged next-gen game, unchanged in its content but transcended by its form, which deserves to be rediscovered sooner or later.","If it’s been some time since you played the original or if you never played it at all, The Last of Us Part 1 is totally worth its price considering it’s the best way to experience its wonder. Otherwise it just reads like a bestselling book with an updated cover.",,,"Without reference to the original, it’s not always easy to appreciate The Last of Us: Part I’s impressive improvements. This is a much better game than the original, though, with stronger art direction, smoother gameplay, and much more emotional cinematics. Naughty Dog has done justice to the original by improving on it in almost every regard, but it remains the game you remember from 2013. At a more competitive price point, it’d be essential – as it is, it’s a pricey upgrade on a bona fide classic.","The price is really abusive, at least in Mexico. Nobody should pay 1,799 MXN for a video game. The best thing you can do is look for the best deal in the not too distant future, because there is no point in paying those prices when the console will also soon go up in price.","The remake brings huge changes in terms of graphics, the gameplay has remained the same in many ways. Some imperfections could definitely be improved, but it is still a great game that still has a hard time finding a competitor. You will definitely enjoy this experience. And it doesn't matter if you're a veteran or if it's your first time with The Last of Us.","The Last of Us Part I is not an extremely extensive remake like Resident Evil 2 or 3, but also certainly not a mockery in the vein of XIII or Warcraft III: Reforged. With a lot of love and dedication, the game has been aligned with the graphics and, to a lesser extent, the gameplay of The Last of Us Part II, making the two games a perfect match. Ideal if you haven't played both yet, and otherwise only worth buying for the biggest fans and rich tattoos.","A completely pointless remake of one of the best games of the last decade, except with only half the content and at double the price.","As you might expect, with The Last of Us Part 1, PlayStation and Naughty Dog have worked to faithfully recreate the basic adventure with all that that entails. On the one hand, the graphics are breathtakingly beautiful and realistic, while on the other, the levels and the gameplay are reminiscent of the 2010s. But in the end, all that's retained is the wonderful epic with Ellie and Joël, even though we already know their story. Even after ten years, The Last of Us's script and plot haven't aged a bit. It's still as strong, poignant, catchy. A steamroller such that we forget the anachronistic stylistic effects and the few flaws. More than ever, it's time to (re)discover this post-apo masterpiece.","The Last of Us Part I is a beautiful thing to behold, honouring your recollection by surpassing it.","Unforgettable characters, sky-high stakes, nail-biting action, and impeccable pacing make The Last of Us Part I a superlative gaming experience in every possible sense.","If you can fling yourself over the price hurdle, The Last of Us Part 1 is absolutely the best version of the single-player game. The environments look superb, the characters are rendered perfectly, and the gameplay remains super satisfying. What’s more, the game has been opened up to a wider audience with a comprehensive suite of accessibility settings, and veteran players can sweat it out in the Permadeath and Speedrun modes. The price tag is cheeky, undoubtedly, but if anyone can pull off this wallet heist, it’s Naughty Dog with The Last of Us.","The Last Of Us is as brutal, challenging, and enjoyable as it always has been. With hugely improved visuals, small but meaningful gameplay changes, and a great range of accessibility options, this Part 1 Remake is without a doubt the definitive version for both newcomers and longtime fans.","Did we really need it? Nope. Is it too expensive? Yes, it is. But who cares, it's a game of eternal beauty, and after this graphic overhaul it still wins against the majority of ""new"" triple A games on the market. Hands down.","The Last of Us is still a great survival-action game with a captivating story, intense action and two of the best main characters you've ever seen. The new version looks mostly amazing and quiet deserves being considered as a PS5 native. But because it remains the same game experience at its core, first and foremost The Last of Us: Part 1 is interesting for people who did not play the original before or who are hardcore fans of the series.",,"Remake or remaster? Since its announcement last June, the name for the redesign of The Last of Part 1 has been debated among players and even internally between Sony Interactive Entertainment and Naughty Dog. At Jeuxactu, we defend the fact that it is indeed a remake, certainly not as complete as some titles can be that are reworked 20/30 years later, but there are enough visual changes to use the correct term. Too bad that Sony Interactive Entertainment (finally Jim Ryan especially) makes players pay a high price. Because hey, 80€, it's just abused.","The Last of Us Part 1 is still one of the best games of the last decade and an absolute must-play for newcomers. For anyone making the unforgettable journey with Joel and Ellie for the very first time, this is a five-star experience. Despite that, due to a lack of incentives – aside from the graphical glow-up – as well as a steep price of entry, it's hard to justify a second (or even third) purchase for returning players.","As much as we love the skeleton, the way it’s been built upon here feels like a missed opportunity. The chance to incorporate Part II’s stellar gameplay evolutions into the original heart-wrenching story was there; had Naughty Dog taken it, it could have been a game-changer. Instead, this feels like an obligatory reshoot. Yes, it’s visually stunning (one of PS5’s best), and yes, things have been changed. But the end result? Too familiar. Neat extras are here, like a speedrun mode, behind the scenes videos, and commentary tracks – but we’d hoped for something bolder. [Issue#19, p.74]","The Last of Us Part I may not be the most necessary remake in history, which seeks a new audience for the new generation and also future viewers of the HBO series; but also aims to remain for posterity, giving a greater aesthetic cohesion between Part I and Part II. [Recommended]","If you have the bandwidth to play this emotionally brutal adventure one more time, or if it's new to you, TLOU Pt 1 is the best version yet. If you need more than upgraded combat to put you over the top, wait for a sale.",,Quick Look,,"Revisiting it now really is like watching an old favorite movie again. Its earnestness ensures a timelessness to the story that too many other games miss when they try to seize a moment in time. The written dialogue still shines, and the performances still sing.",,"With The Last of Us Part I, Naughty Dog opted to create the ‘definitive’ experience by staying as faithful as possible while incorporating some elements of The Last of Us Part II. The result is an impressive-looking facelift that exceeds the visuals of Part II, but doesn’t offer much new beyond graphics.","The Last of Us Part I is far from a wholly necessary experience, but it's a well-crafted and polished one from start to finish.","A very faithful remake of a masterpiece that, with virtually no significant changes, makes it more spectacular and enjoyable than ever.","With a hefty price tag and less content than its more than acceptable PS4 counterpart, The Last of Us Part 1 is an entirely unnecessary remake with gorgeous graphics that only make its dated gameplay stick out even more.",An impressively gorgeous remake of a bonafide masterpiece. Just don't expect that hefty price tag to bring much more than cosmetic feeling changes to this emotional narrative.,,"No matter from which point of view, The Last Of Us Part 1 can be called a masterpiece. Naughty Dog has reconstructed a generation of classics with new technology, making this old game great again.",,The Last of Us Part 1 doesn’t take many risks and ends up being an excellent but ultimately conservative remake.,,"The Last of Us Part 1 goes far beyond the sterile debate about the price and the real nature of this remake. The work done by Naughty Dog is majestic and involves every single aspect of the game: from the combat to the artificial intelligence, passing through the enemies and every single menu and interface on the screen. And as if this were not enough, the new technical aspect is stunning, reaching peaks, especially for what concerns the faces and the facial animations, which still today we do not find in other videogame productions.","What matters, in my opinion, is knowing that Part 1 is the best version of a game out of the parameters, yesterday as today. I am willing to swear it.","The Last of Us - Part 1 is a complete overhaul of a masterpiece, simply the best that Naughty Dog could do with the original game",,,"Joel's redemption is bittersweet, and come the end credits, you may wonder what it was all for. I know I did the first time around, but with the benefit of time on my back, I've come to appreciate the nuanced storytelling that much more, and for me, that's where The Last of Us: Part 1 finds its worth; it's the best possible version of Naughty Dog's best ever game.",,"Almost 10 years after its initial release The Last of Us remains a masterpiece, a game so important and unique that has no match. And it got even better with its new ""coat of paint"".","Even though it doesn’t provide the gameplay overhaul that some gamers were no doubt anticipating, The Last of Us Part 1 is still the best way to enjoy one of the most intelligent and well designed games of recent memory. The updated visuals helps to breathe new life into the story, and the world it presents has never felt more immersive. And that’s before considering the plethora of accessibility features on hand, enabling swathes of gamers to play the game for the first time and see what all the fuss is about.","This remake reveals the secret of Naughty Dog's latest success, the way it has perfected its gameplay model, without ever neglecting the cinematic element. The story remains central to the experience in The Last of Us Part 1, but taking everything it learned from the second part, the studio gives us a true masterclass in set pieces of action and emotionality. We go through scene after scene totally immersed in Joel and Ellie and their quest, as if to ""live a movie"" that we no longer remember, even though we know how it will end.","If this wasn’t a remake, I firmly believe it would be right at the top of Game of the Year articles as we assess things over a bit of Christmas Pudding. The PS5 has had some brilliant games already, no doubt, but as a fan of The Last of Us, Part 1 is my new favourite exclusive on the console. If you dislike Naughty Dog games, nothing here is going to change your views, but existing Doggers (yes, I’m using it) will lap this up and appreciate the work that’s gone into it.",,"A gorgeous and well-honed remake of one of the biggest boppers in the PlayStation pantheon, The Last of Us Part I is the best way to play – or replay – Naughty Dog’s esteemed survival classic. The striking improvements it makes to its completely rebuilt world are complemented by the subtle refinements of its characters’ performances, and while it isn’t retrofitted with every one of the sequel’s best changes, the upgrades to movement and AI make a welcome difference in an already outstanding game. It’s harder to argue it was an entirely crucial remake, though, considering 2014’s The Last of Us Remastered still stands head and shoulders above nearly all of its story-driven, action-adventure peers to this day.","The Last of Us Part I represents the logical quality improvement of the original game, bringing it up to the same caliber as its sequel without making too many radical changes and completely removing the multiplayer. But, if you haven't yet experienced the world of The Last of Us, this release is a great time to do so.","The Last of Us Part 1 is the definitive version of Naughty Dog's masterpiece of the PS3 era. Although it does not include the new gameplay mechanics from Part 2, like dodging or crawling, the game still feels modern and the story is still one of the best in video game history. The graphics are absolutely phenomenal and because of the new facial animations Part 1 is even more emotional than the original. Thanks to the Features of the Dualsense controller and 3D Audio is is also more immersive. The Last of Us has always been a special experience and now it is one for the new generation as well.","While it’s certainly disappointing to see The Last Of Us return without its iconic multiplayer, Factions, players are so incredibly fortunate to get to re-experience a game that is widely considered one of the all-time greats, remade from top to bottom, and given the tender love, and care that it deserves. Every pore is as it should be, every texture perfected, and every moment, something to savour. Many will look at The Last Of Us Part I and consider it an unnecessary investment from Sony, the original still looks great – but Naughty Dog have pulled off the impossible in making the definitive video game of the last decade, somehow, even better, and in doing so they’ve also opened it up to millions of new players, of a variety of needs and levels of experience. It turns out that you can improve upon perfection.","Whether or not it truly needs to exist, the fact remains: The Last of Us Part I does exist, and it happens to be the best version of an already pretty good game. The additional accessibility options alone justify it for that section of players. Meanwhile, those who are interested in experiencing its story when it looks its best, whether as a first-timer or a veteran revisiting an old favorite, should strongly consider playing it. For everyone else, the other versions are available for less.","The Last of Us is (and always was) a masterpiece and Part I is unquestionably the best version of it yet, but that may not be enough for anyone hoping for a complete reinvention of the formula from the ground up...Part I adds just enough to warrant its remake for the latest hardware, which elevates it to the same level of The Last of Us Part II in smart design choices, flexibility and technical prowess even if it’s still the third time we’ve made this journey before...If Naughty Dog’s original PS3 version was the critically acclaimed theatrical release, then Part I is the Criterion 4K remaster complete with commentary and behind-the-scenes footage.","Taken as a whole, The Last of Us Part 1 is a very human tale that feels just as vital as ever. And with this faithful remake, here's hoping that a new generation of gamers will get to experience one of the best games ever created. Period.","Sitting somewhere between remake and remaster, the asking price is steep, but The Last of Us Part 1 is a beautiful version of one of PlayStation’s best ever games.","The Last of Us Part I finds a way to make an already incredible game even better. It may not be the most needed remake in the landscape of gaming, and I can't fault anyone for not wanting to pay full price for the experience, but it's undeniable just how much work has gone into this release. Phenomenal graphics, superb sound design, immersive DuelSense controller features, beneficial gameplay tweaks, and the best suite of accessibility features found in gaming. The Last of Us Part I is a must-play title for anyone still yet to experience Joel and Ellie's story.","Sure, this might be the third time that Naughty Dog has released The Last of Us, but it’s also the most fully realized version. The enhanced visuals and animation bring Joel and Ellie’s story to life in a way that was previously unimaginable, and the gameplay still holds up, despite not totally catching up to Part II. Whether or not you want to pay to play the same story for a third time is up to you, but that won’t change the fact that it’s better than it’s ever been.",The Last of Us Part 1 is an excellent remake of a PS3 milestone that doesn't quite go the final mile in a few spots.,"This is the best game for players who want to feel the impression of the original once again with improved graphics. It delivers the nostalgic impression we have all experienced beyond time with outstanding narratives and enhanced facial expressions of the characters. However, the fully priced game despite the same story in 9 years can make you think twice before buying it.","The Last of Us Part I is a game that adapts its excellence to the current generation and goes way further than any simple remastered game. Regardless of its age, it is still a masterful game with the excellent combination of its history, gameplay and, above all, the improvements with the DualSense. It's a good way to start the saga if you haven't played any of the previous games.","While the price point might detract some gamers, The Last of Us Part 1 needs to be checked out. If you already played the original game a bunch of times, there's still a lot of value present. Players that haven't experienced one of the best games of all time should buy the definitive way to play this masterpiece.",,"An interesting formal adaptation of an adventure that, nine years later, still has a lot to say.","More beautiful than ever, the adventure offered by the remake of The Last of Us Part 1 fully exploits the PS5's capabilities. But the lack of fresh content or significant innovations gives the unpleasant impression of paying a high price for a graphic patch. We therefore recommend it above all to the hardcore fans of the original, as well as to players who are new to the license and who absolutely want the best possible experience.",,"I am still not sure how to feel about Remakes, especially about a Remake, which we already had a Remaster of. But I know The Last of Us is a masterpiece; whether it's a Remake or a Remaster. There are only a handful of games that could make me feel this entertained and emotional (and occasionally fill my eyes with tears) at the same time. This is one of them.","The Last of Us Part 1 is a game that doesn’t feel like it needs to exist, but I’m glad it does. Even though that outdated 2013 design still bleeds through, the visual upgrades, combat tweaks and accessibility improvements makes it feel like a brand new title. In time, this will become the de facto definitive edition of the game that will be enjoyed for generations to come.",Naughty Dog have created a masterpiece of a remake in The Last of Us Part 1. All of the emotion and action has been brought to the PS5 in stunning fashion.,"The remake of The Last of Us: Part I on PlayStation 5 brings Naughty Dog's beloved classic to the same level of technical quality as its sequel and other flagship titles of this new generation Sony, making the two experiences much more homogeneous between them, with an eye towards the improvement of AI and many options for accessibility. If you have so far missed the opportunity to immerse yourself in this apocalyptic world with Joel and Ellie, this is certainly the best time to make up for it. As long as you are willing to spend.",,,,"The Last of Us Part 1 is a PS3 game that looks like a PS5 one that’s also been jacked up to Sony’s premium, $125 AUD current-gen console title price point. That’s unacceptable.",,"Last of Us Part I has managed to modernize the game that was released 9 years ago in terms of gameplay and visuals. Although there is a price problem for those who have just played the Remastered version, I can say that it is an adventure that should not be missed by those who have never played it.","The Last of Us may not have needed a remake, but there's no denying the sheer quality of it. Its visuals, from the environment to the character models, look like they're plucked directly from a movie. The new lighting and shadows make for a more realistic experience, without completely changing the atmosphere. Its gameplay, especially the shooting, still needs some fine-tuning, but every improvement just serves to make a near-perfect game even better.","If we were to judge Part I only as a remake which isn't bringing anything gameplay or story-wise, the score would be 70. But at the end of the day, the Naughty Dog masterpiece is getting its best version yet so it couldn't be anything else than a perfect 10.","The Last of Us Part I is faithful to the original masterpiece, preserving the emotions of Naughty Dog’s groundbreaking tale while removing some limitations of aging technology that held it back. The story is still as powerful now as it ever was, and the stealth action combat remains tense and meaningful. The visuals are undeniably breathtaking, but contribute to a different vibe that isn’t always better. The world will surely debate which version of The Last of Us is superior in the years to come, but really, there’s no right or wrong answer.","The Last of Us Part 1 remakes the beloved 2013 PS3 game in stunning detail, but it's difficult to recommend at full price with so few changes.","If you’ve never played the original Last of Us, I would argue this is the version worth playing. The upgrades over the original are quite numerous. From the upgraded visuals and impeccable work done on lighting and shadows, to the expansion of accessibility options and even new ones over The Last of Us Part 2, and finally a multitude of subtle gameplay improvements that make the whole experience all the more enjoyable, this is a fully upgraded package. I won’t say every “improvement” is actually an improvement or even necessary, but the sheer amount of polish added to this version of the game likely ensures I will never go back to The Last of Us Remastered over Part 1, given the choice. [Impressions]","While the original will always have its place in the hearts of many players, The Last of Us Part I is the definitive way to experience the beginning of Joel and Ellie’s journey, even if the price is a little steep.","All of The Last of Us Part I's improvements taken by themselves may seem minor, but together they make one of the most memorable games of the PS3 era even better. In some ways, the two parts of The Last of Us are now better aligned, making transitioning between them much smoother. However, in other ways, the years of progress in game design and development are all too apparent. But while some of the level design may not have aged all that well, the vivid cast of characters and remarkable story are more poignant than ever.",,"The best thing I can say about The Last of Us Part 1 is that it meets Naughty Dog's previous claim: this is absolutely the definitive edition of the game. Not only do the improved graphics, lighting, and animations make for a better throughline experience, but they also add more emotional resonance to Joel and Ellie's story than ever before. In the brief history of the PS5, The Last of Us Part 1 is one of the most visually impressive games that I've played so far and it makes me that much more excited to see what Naughty Dog does with its next wholly new project for the platform.","The Last of Us Part 1 is a hard game to review. On one hand it is still an amazing achievement all these years later. The story is fantastic, and the characters are some of the best. I love the original game and this remake doesn’t change that. Still for $70 it is a lot to ask for a game that hasn’t exactly been out of the conversation since it released. The removal of multiplayer is also questionable, but I guess it makes sense as players could still play that in the PS4 remaster. There is a lot to appreciate here, and truly this is one of the best-looking games ever created.","The 2013 release of The Last of Us was highly influential. The brilliantly-written-and- performed story is as good as ever in The Last of Us Part 1, and the introduction of dozens of new accessibility features should be celebrated and emulated. The visual quality is staggering, bringing the emotional highs and lows of The Last of Us to the fore more than ever. Unfortunately, the gameplay that was passable in 2013 isn't good by today's standards. Calling a game that hasn't improved on a fundamental level a ""remake"" is a stretch. TLoU Part 1 is for super fans of the series or those who missed the first two versions, especially for accessibility reasons. For everyone else, it's hard to recommend spending the 15 or so hours it takes to play through The Last of Us yet again.",,"The Last of Us Part 1 is a remarkable remake that proves its worth very quickly. It is carefully faithful to the original script but passionately keen to improve the experience where it can, by honing in on the emotional resonance of its most effective scenes while elevating the thrilling brutality of its combat. This is one of gaming’s most incredible stories made definitive. Even the greatest sceptic of its legacy may not be able to resist its charming characters, airtight mechanics and thematic nuance. The Last of Us Part 1 is a beautiful, accessible entry point for newcomers and a victory lap for fans. Don’t miss it.","The Last of Us Part I shows that Naughty Dog’s gritty action game is still an enduring classic that hasn’t aged a day. Though that’s largely because Sony won’t allow it to, as evidenced by a mostly superfluous remake that doesn’t meaningfully improve on the game’s perfectly modern (and much cheaper) 2014 remaster. However, the project does once again push the industry forward in an important way: by raising the bar for accessibility in gaming’s past, present, and future.","Is all of this worth £70? That’s entirely up to you to decide. With the original game approaching a decade old, and that HBO adaptation arriving some time in 2023, it’s no surprise that Part I has been revived for modern audiences. Much to our own surprise, what playing this remake taught us was that we’re totally fine with the idea of it. This is the sort of treatment the best games demand, and the closest to timeless that they’ll ever come. The Last of Us deserves nothing less.",,"There's nothing to complain about in this gorgeous, accessible remake of a gaming classic—except the mercenary nature of its very existence.","If you didn’t like TLOU in the first place, this remake won’t change your mind. It’s still gruesome and dark, a mix of a heart-rending post-apocalyptic story and a sometimes awkward video game. The core is the same as always. What this remake does, though, is smooth the transition between the two games in the franchise. Think of it like sanding away (most of) the game’s rough edges. That will likely be important to those who played Part II before the original or the hypothetical brand-new audience that will be introduced to The Last of Us through HBO’s live-action adaptation next year or the standalone multiplayer experience that’s also coming. The Last of Us is now a franchise — and within that framework, a remake so soon actually makes a lot of sense.",,,"Worthy of being hailed as a potential Game of the Generation when it was first released, The Last of Us Part I is fully remade for a new generation of PlayStation consoles. With some of Naughty Dog's best graphical tech to date, this is one you'll have to see to believe.","The Last of Us Part I is the perfect excuse to return to the story of Joel and Ellie, with a renewed graphic section that allows us to relive the adventure in the most spectacular way possible.",,,,,,,,,,"Regardless of how one feels about charging $70 for an update to a game from 2013, The Last of Us remains an utterly compelling ride.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ratchet-clank-rift-apart,"Despite its title’s declaration of intent, Rift Apart isn’t willing to stand on its own.",,,"The result is one of the sprightliest blockbusters since Insomniac's own Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and a lesson in pacing from which Sony's forthcoming PS5 big guns would do well to learn. Sure, you might find it starting to slip from memory even as the credits are rolling, but in the moment? For the most part, it's rather riveting. [Issue#360, p.104]",,"Ratchet And Clank Rift Apart is an excellent game, very fun and sets the bar very high. With a nervous and devilishly effective gameplay and its sublime and bluffing universe of life, it is undoubtedly the one we were waiting for. The breathtaking rhythm between each stunning cinematic. A video game that offers the perfect blend between a Pixar and pure Ratchet. Too bad that Rivet does not come out more in its gameplay because it is a superb character.","Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart uses the same familiar formula and pushes them even beyond the max level, and the result is a beautiful, charming experience with hundreds of shocking moments.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a beautiful, occasionally stunning effort from Sony first party studio Insomniac. It's a series of summer blockbusters strung together with all the bombast and spectacle of a Michael Bay film. Yes, the price is probably too high, but we'd still recommend it.","Even without the PS5 features shining through, the wonderful graphics, and the non-existent load times, what we're left with is a superb game, one that I encourage everyone to play on their PS5. Calling this ""a must-have"" would sell short how fun, replayable and addictive this game is. A well deserved perfect score.","If there is one title that feels like it beckons the start of the next-gen era, it is undoubtedly this game. Its flawless presentation and beautiful graphics may be polluted by a glitch or two along the way, but nonetheless, it is an amazing experience that just can't be recommended enough.","Veteran developers Insomniac have taken advantage of the PS5’s capabilities to create a sumptuous spread, combining rich, Hollywood-grade CG environments and character models with liberal screenfuls of retina-scorching special effects. Playing the opening tutorial level feels like stepping into an animated movie – a sensation rarely dissipates over the dozen-or-so hours of Rift Apart’s amiable campaign.",,"Technically Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a PS5 showstopper, offering stunning graphics and set pieces that make use of the PS5's SSD, while also looking like the best animated movie we have ever seen. But, although combat is fun, the narrative of Rift Apart really drags down the experience, not treating its characters with respect and not meaningfully progressing the story for long time fans and leaving newcomers confused. Rift Apart is a fun ride, but ultimately not one you will be talking about for years to come.",,"Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart makes the most of the Playstation 5's power and it shows in the small details that make its worlds and characters not to mention the great effects and explosions, it is one of the best entries in the series and one of the best Playstation 5 exclusive so far.","A continuist sequel but one that knows how to add what is necessary and incorporate new ideas. It's true that the greater breadth of its maps is not fully exploited and that wanting to make a longer game by repeating situations and enemies turn virtue into routine, but Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a great PS5 game, very fun and recommended.","What really makes this game innovative is undoubtedly the graphical aspect. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart had to show what the PS5 is capable of and it succeeds wonderfully. The planets, the characters, the use of color, it all looks breathtaking. As if you've landed in an interactive animated film. If we have to mention one drawback, it's that the creators perhaps want to show a little too much of what's possible, which makes the game a bit chaotic at times.","The virtues of the title, to which they add a great final stretch or certain extra challenges that complement the game as a whole (here some ideas could have been exploited further), end up being much greater than these setbacks.","The classic action that has been a hallmark of the Ratchet and Clank series is alive and well. In addition, the central dimensional warp mechanic is a real joy, packing even more surprises than I’d expected. The various weapons are fun to use, while the excellent level design, exhilarating gameplay and thrilling festival spirit combine to result in an action game that has been honed to the limits. Newcomers to the series may wish for a little more explanation of the story and the controls in places, but Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is a game I would recommend to anyone.",Overall a fantastic new title for the PS5. That console’s now-best available exclusive action-platform game. A perfect hit for those hot summer days of gaming.,"It goes without saying that if you already have a PS5 in your house, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is something that you simply cannot pass up, because it is precisely one of the things that justifies having spent so much on a new generation console. It is one of those games in which it hurts to progress because each time you do it, you are closer to the inevitable end.","For as long as the adventure lasts, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart does pretty much everything that a Ratchet and Clank fan and PS5 player would hope for. It tells a great story, has trademark humor and quality voice acting, and the pacing and gameplay is always satisfying and enjoyable. If you’re looking for a new PS5 exclusive for the summer, this is it.","It’s visually striking, mechanically sound and diverse, and it takes advantage of the bells and whistles tied to the new platform. Some might be disappointed by the story, but overall the dimension-hopping adventure is exactly the type of fun-loving experience that Insomniac Games has been delivering since the very beginning. At a time when there aren’t a lot of games highlighting the power of next-gen, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart shows the next big leap for gaming.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a breathtaking thrill ride of action, utilizing the PlayStation 5 architecture in truly impressive ways. A heartfelt story and gorgeously crafted worlds are complimented by stunning combat bursting with visual flair.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a wonderful platformer with hectic and hilarious combat. New character Rivet is the game's brightest spark, and while the story is a trifle overambitious, the characters and loveable enough and funny enough to constantly keep your interest.","It feels as though Insomniac's writers have taken their cues from more recent Marvel movies, managing the tricky balancing act of cartoon mayhem and emotional payoffs. It made me, a casual lombax fancier, more invested in the series than ever before, and hoping we get to see a lot more of the fabulous foursome soon.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a superb blockbuster game that hits its brief perfectly. It shows a meticulous eye for detail, throws one brilliant action set piece after another at the player, and is the best showcase yet for the PlayStation 5 hardware. Sure, it's as shallow as a pool of water on Venus, but I've no doubt people coming to this game are simply looking for a vividly entertaining product, and that's exactly what they'll get.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is simply brilliant. Between its thrilling gameplay, fantastic graphics, and charming story, it's a must-have for PS5 players everywhere. There haven't been many games to justify a step into the new console generation as of yet, but this is definitely one of them.",,"The capabilities of the PlayStation 5 enhance and improve a pre-existing game series, rather than give us something altogether new. This isn’t a bold reinvention for Ratchet & Clank, but the same relentless, varied, sometimes funny, always charming, fun action game, only with some fancy new tricks and a higher price tag.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is, on one hand, a sublime experience regarding the technical aspects, one which fully utilizes PS5's hardware in order to become the most 'next-gen' thing up until now. On the other hand, it is also much more than a simple showing of Sony's new console power: it is a game with both a heart and a soul, a love letter to the whole Ratchet & Clank franchise.","Insomniac made us wait long for new Ratchet & Clank adventures but it was worth it. Looking like a Pixar movie, Rift Apart is the first truly next-gen title and the first proper reason to buy a PS5. It is absolutely stunning in almost every aspect – from guns and story to optimization and use of adaptive triggers. It’s a pity though that inter-dimensional portals were not used to their full potential, and both playable characters (the second one being the female lombax Rivet) differ only in appearance. [08/2021, p.28]",,"Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart isn't afraid to revel in its mascot-platformer roots, but it manages to knock so many of its competitors completely out of the water.","Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is the first PS5 exclusive that I can recommend everyone go out and buy. It's a cutting-edge visual masterclass of what the PS5 is capable of, but with the soul of the original R&C games, packaged with a comprehensive set of accessibility options.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is an exciting action title, that simply never gets boring. You can expect colorful characters, epic battles, and fun to explore worlds. On the tech side Rift Apart shows everything that PlayStation 5 has to offer, be it great visuals, surround sound, or DualSense features. It's the perfect benchmark for Sony's new gaming system.","Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart is a beautiful and action packed adventure, but which sadly leaves its characters' personalities and fun, snarky comments behind in favour of more shooting, strafing, and a more sanitized, Disney-like story.",I love Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart because it is a fun and beautiful adventure. It's not about setting you loose to stumble across objectives and side activities across an open-world map. And I love those kinds of games.,,"Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is easily the best game in the series by far. Though surprisingly, it isn’t the fact that it looks jaw-droppingly gorgeous that impresses the most. Instead, it’s the sheer variety of gameplay that Insomniac Games has managed to cram into its running time, with each and every aspect of it flawlessly complementing the others. With effectively zero loading times, from the moment you boot up Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart you’re engrossed in its engaging story and eclectic mix of third-person shooting, platforming, dimensional shifting and a whole lot more. And it’s all so polished that you could see yourself in it. If you have a PS5, consider this essential.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a true showpiece of new-gen technology. Whilst the internet argues over the matter of cross-generation games, Rift Apart avoids any such controversy since what it's doing simply isn't possible on the older hardware.","I can thoroughly recommend Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart to, well, anyone. This is the sort of game that everyone can play and enjoy, and although it's a shooter through and through, it's not violently graphic and the storyline is lighthearted and easy to get along with. The world, characters, and gameplay are all gorgeous. It's maybe the most impressive game I have ever played. I look forward to the future of Ratchet and Clank and Rivet, and Insomniac's plans for the trio.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is the game you've been waiting for, filled with stunning visuals, magnificent gameplay, and so much more.","Humour has always been a defining feature of Ratchet & Clank, right back to its origins on the PlayStation 2, but it doesn’t try too hard. It’s funny in a laid-back, undemanding way, and the story is similarly easy to digest. Rift Apart did not exactly challenge me, but it entertained me immensely. It’s just such a lot of fun, and so gorgeous I still can’t quite believe it. If this is an indication of how the new generation of consoles can infuse familiar-feeling games with new wonder, we’re in for a great few years.","Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart is very important for the PS5 as it's a true showcase of what the hardware is capable of. The dynamic duo looks amazing in 4K, although it's the ray-tracing that really shines the most. Rivet is also an amazing addition to the cast, while the gameplay truly feels next-gen thanks to the DualSense and SSD. The game is rather short however which makes the 75 euro price tag stand out.","In many ways Rift Apart is the first ""next gen"" game. It truly feels like playing a Pixar movie, with great details, animations and an impressive weapon catalogue. Traveling through dimensions mechanics never cease to amaze.","Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart has something for almost everyone. Fast and satisfying combat and gameplay, absolutely jaw-dropping good looks, a fantastic score, and narrative design, writing, and acting that could be plugged right in as the next Pixar film. I felt some feels, grinned constantly, and yes, I’m going to go back and play it again. Right now.",Ratchet and Clank Rift Appart is the first great demonstration of what the next generation consoles can do. Their changes in dimensions and how they are integrated into the game are jaw-dropping and uniquely integrated into the gameplay. Pure lombax muscle for PS5.,Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart is a wow experience on the PlayStation 5 that boasts next-gen graphics and gameplay to match with multiverse mayhem thrown into the mix!,,,,"Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a terrific, extremely beautiful game with solid gameplay and tons of fun. It doesn't add anything new, though - we got a safe sequel to one of the most important PlayStation series, a game perfect for a new wave of gamers.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is one of the best games I’ve played this year. It’s fun, it’s endearing, and I just want to play it again. The gameplay isn’t much different, but it’s refined and has aged like a fine wine, with the technical prowess on display we’ve come to expect from Insomniac Games. If you’re looking for a great narrative, the story is arguably the best in the series, with the grandeur of a Marvel movie in tow. One could imply the game isn’t long enough, but that’s only because they put down the controller, and that’s just not what you’re going to do if you have a copy of Rift Apart.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart could be one of the first true all-encompassing showcases for the PS5. Every time I sat down to play it, I felt like I was about to start a really long episode of a good show. If there's one small nitpick, it's that I felt that some of the larger confrontations got slightly repetitive — I mean, how many versions of ""juggernauts"" am I supposed to fight? Also, one might get the sense that not enough risks were taken and that the game's design, as cool as it is, feels comfortable and safe. That feels like a discussion for the artists among us, and this doesn't feel like the time for a literary salon. I am on my third playthrough of Rift Apart, and I'm enjoying it as much as the first time I went through it. Sometimes, all a game has to be is fun.","The many technical feats that steal the show in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart will be talked about for a long time to come. The graphic violence will make you want to buy a PlayStation 5. But this crazy journey through dimensions will also delight young and old with a very diverse arsenal of weapons, fun gadgets and many endearing characters.","Insomniac has long since proven to be among the best developers in the industry with high-caliber titles such as Spider-Man and Miles Morales, but now it also manages to graduate Ratchet, Clank, Rivet and Kit to the pantheon of great characters and exclusive Sony sagas with a game that is synonymous with fun and a visual wonder.","Some minor missed opportunities aside this Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart is an unforgettable, unbelievably gorgeous and downright addictive game and easily the best entry in the fan-favourite franchise. For all of its jaw-dropping visuals, industry-leading design and writing packed with heart and humour it succeeds on first and foremost being a really good time. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is the most fun I've had with a DualSense in my hand and it stands as the best current reason to own a PS5.",,Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a PS5 Highlight that shines in terms of gameplay and story and also sets technical standards.,"Once Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart's credits rolled, I was impressed by the adventure that I just went on. With that being said, I couldn't help but want to dive into the original games again to have a more visceral and challenging experience.",,"All in all, though, Rift Apart makes for an exceptionally easy recommendation. It’s fun for gamers of all ages and genders, absolutely crammed with action, laugh-out-loud funny in parts, and — I can’t stress this enough — looks the way we all imagined the next generation of console games should. I think I speak for PlayStation 5 gamers everywhere when I say we’ll happily take a few more like this.",,"Thanks to its gorgeous visuals and deeper narrative, Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart arises the series to a new level. With many locations to enjoy, a lot of weapons to try out and many, many collectibles to find, everyone should find a good reason to embark on this bidimensional journey, even though the obvious collision bugs are still way too present.","What’s so good about this installment of Ratchet and Clank is that it is a true labor of love. There is no other way a game can feel so good, play so well, and take you on an impressive adventure all without that special ingredient to keep it going. The definition of a next-gen title, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is a must-play that will leave you super satisfied and hungry for another big game like this one.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a delightful platformer that pays homage to the series with fantastic gameplay and, at times, eye-poppingly beautiful graphics. It is an excellent and worthwhile game, but it still suffers from bugs and crashes. In addition, the visual quality is a bit inconsistent per planet, which makes the game a bit lacking. This is a pity, but it does not change the fact that this is a title worth playing. Put it in the “very good, but not perfect” category.",Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is like a 20-plus hour fireworks display. It is pure spectacle — cascades of riotous colors wrapped around polished gameplay tropes.,"Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is the best game in the series since Ratchet & Clank: A Crack in Time, which franchise fans will recognise as high praise. The familiar combat is elevated by outstanding DualSense implementation, while Insomniac Games’ imaginative gameplay design keeps each planet interesting and engaging. It’s not a particularly challenging platformer, nor is it necessarily all that original – but it doesn’t need to be. This is one of those games that’s just really, really good.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is not a revolutionary step for the series and avoids risks. However, it does come at a time when the duo needed to return to our lives and the PlayStation 5 required good games. They are both in luck.","Charming, infinitely fun and full of content and ideas, such is the new game from Insomniac Games. Another notch in the collection of titles that PlayStation owners simply should not miss.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart may not be the best, most impactful or emotionally charged game, but it is one of the most beautiful and most of all the most fun ever made. Every PS5 owner should play this. You don't want anything, it's mandatory.","The graphics are absolutely stunning but the gameplay is predictable and surprisingly uneventful, as the game fails to leverage its technical achievements for anything more than straightforward spectacle.","Funny, wonderfully lively, sublime and impossible to leave once embarked on the adventure, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart offers exactly what we expected: A delightful space journey through dimensions, suitable for the whole family.","Even if you have your doubts, it’s difficult not to smile at the graphical and cinematic fireworks on display; Sony ordered a parade for the PS5, and Insomniac has served it to us. The arsenal has been upped, and size, it turns out, does matter.",,"Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is proof that some series are timeless. It celebrates and retains the classic gameplay first created nearly 20 years ago, while simultaneously feeling completely at home as a showcase PS5 title. It tells a heartfelt story that explores beyond Ratchet and Clank, bringing in new characters that stand tall in their own right. And those tools of destruction? They’re here in spades, more destructive than ever before. Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart continues the PlayStation legacy, and I can’t help but hope that in time it heralds the return of the PlayStation buddy platformers of old.",,"Rift Apart in is the update that the Ratchet and Clank franchise needed. Insomniac has created an incredibly entertaining product, which never ceases to amuse. Unfortunately, a certain instability of the code (even after day one patch) prevents the game from reaching a higher score, but we feel confident that future updates will fix the code.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is nothing less than the best part of the series so far. And that means a great deal after several great predecessors on PlayStation consoles. It is not just concerning the next-gen dignified technical implementation on PS5 or Rift Apart's humorous story with its likeable heroes. Just every aspect of the game, including gunplay and riddles, works well and neat together.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart delivers some fun action and great looking visuals with a charming art style, but it doesn't really push the gameplay boundaries of the familiar franchise formula.","As we expected, Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart is a true next-gen experience, harnessing the many capabilities of the PlayStation 5 with flying colors. Supported by a wonderful artistic direction, we have here a really impressive technical showcase, proving once again that the DualSense has potential that can change a lot of things.",,"Just like the super-satisfying weaponry, Rift Apart shoots on all cylinders to set a new bar for PS5. We’ve never had a game like this before. [Issue#3, p.120]","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart has become ""that"" first game that presents the values of the new generation better than any other. [Recommended]",Rift Apart is a welcome and well-polished return to the Ratchet & Clank formula that has served Insomniac well for nearly two decades now. As long as you go in expecting that—and not yearning for some thrilling gameplay revolution driven by new hardware and technology—you’ll come out feeling satisfied.,"This is it though, the character and the absurdity and the charm that Insomniac is all about, that the team kick-started with Ratchet and Clank in 2002 and continue to master with such faultless confidence in Rift Apart. It's just pure craft, pure fun, pure video games - all the brilliant, bizarre ideas this studio has just thrown at the wall and all of them sticking. The only thing it lacks - apart from maybe a tiny bit of restraint - is pretence. There's no self-seriousness, no po-faced melodrama, no insecurity about the form. A game that's happy to be a game, in a familiar, cuddly shape. [Eurogamer Recommended]",,"Rift Apart is, beyond doubt, a fabulous game. It took me 18 hours to reach the credits, because I hunted down every scrap of Raritarium, looked for every secret I could find, and just bathed in its visually astonishing art. I had the best time doing it. Yet, the further I got, the more it nagged at me just how little this series has advanced in 19 years. If having the dimensional conceit and the extraordinary tech wasn’t enough to inspire something new, then what will? If there’s another Ratchet & Clank to come, it’s going to have to make some significant changes, because this might be the last time it can be repeated through its charisma alone.","In a time when sneering, ironic detachment remains in fashion, Insomniac Games has created the rare modern masterpiece with no convoluted agenda, no subtext — just so many reasons to smile and laugh.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart works on multiple levels. It’s an extremely impressive piece of software, designed to show off what Sony’s latest console can do. But more importantly, it’s a great entry in a nearly two-decade-old franchise, offering fans more wacky weapons, clever writing, and fresh biomes to explore. Rift Apart is an easy recommendation for any player lucky enough to get their hands on a PS5, for fans who can’t get enough of Insomniac’s heroic Lombax and his charming robot friend, and for players who want to meet a brave, new Lombax and go on an adventure with her, too.","Those holding out for a showpiece title for their PS5 now have it. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart utilizes the power and functionalities of the PS5 to deliver a must-own experience while also standing as an excellent game on its own. Rift Apart follows Insomniac Games’ tried and true Ratchet & Clank formula, providing excellent gameplay, plenty of content and the signature humor that’s made the characters so endearing.","Rift Apart is a technical showcase, but it's also one of the finest 3D action platformers since Jak and Daxter. Insomniac consistently proves that the Ratchet and Clank series is a wellspring of potential, and they've delivered a complete experience that's as full of heart as it is surprises.","Ratchet & Clank are back with one of the best games in the series. This is a fantastic experience that looks and plays incredibly well, and gives us an audiovisual showcase unmatched to this date. Do not miss it.",Rift Apart cements Ratchet and Clank as one of PlayStation’s premier franchises.,"Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is the PlayStation 5 showcase you have been waiting for. Instantaneous travel to worlds thanks to the SSD, thumping 3D audio, ray tracing through the gorgeous levels, and clever use of the DualSense bring the many locations to life. Paired with classic Ratchet & Clank gameplay, this game is a riotous feast of explosions, platforming, and fast paced action.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart ushers in a new generation of adventure games headed by this charming heroic duo. Sadly, Rivet is a strong setpiece in the narrative but doesn’t differentiate enough in combat. Still, this doesn’t affect the sheer amount of fun you’ll be having during every moment of gameplay. There is so much packed in this adventure complemented by competent level design, amazing weapons, and strong platforming. This is Ratchet & Clank for the new generation, and I hope it’s not too long before we see them again.",,,"With an incredible arsenal of weapons, thrilling combat, a charming story full of loveable characters, and visuals to make your eyes pop, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart might just be the best game in the series to date.",,"Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart throws the saga into the Next Gen dimension. Fun and frenetic, Rift Apart will surprise everyone, even the most skeptical player.","Rift Apart remains a hilarious Ratchet & Clank and sometimes adorable adventure, but also an exclusive, frankly a little less disruptive than expected.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart shows where the series is going in the near future. There are some minor hiccups and wasted opportunities, but the new chapter is undoubtedly a solid one.","The game is stunningly beautiful, incredibly smooth to play, and brilliantly written. A truly vibrant and dynamic universe you will never want to leave.","It's a breezy, short and fun run through a series of bonkers planets, tense boss-fights, and heartfelt cutscenes. With Sony's exclusives like the upcoming God of War sequel being delayed further beyond 2022, we only have a few games to enjoy, but we think you'll cope if you've got Rift Apart to play.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart seamlessly integrates the new with the old, keeping the classic elements that fans know and love, whilst introducing new gameplay features to keep the series fresh. There's no doubt in my mind this will be one of the biggest hits of the year.",,"Probably the best Ratchet & Clank game and surely the best PS5 game to date, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is the distilled essence of all the best elements this franchise has given us through the years. A true gaming masterpiece.","Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is one of the best entries in the series yet, with gripping chaotic shootouts, exhilarating platforming and a charming story. Thanks to the extra firepower of the PS5, there are also lots of next-gen upgrades to enjoy from the jaw-dropping 4K visuals to the immersive DualSense feedback. This is a must buy for PS5 owners.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is the result of a studio's love for a character, a story, proving that the best of the past can be transported to the present, hand in hand with what today's technology can offer. Ratchet, Clank and Rivet deliver the best PlayStation 5 experience, a memorable story that takes its inspiration from the greatest animation. From weapons to enemies, from characters to the environment, this is a title that grabs us, being one of the most fantastic gateways for the youngest to this universe of incredible and impactful experiences that we call videogames.","This is a full-fat, planet-hopping, mystery-filled adventure that PS5 owners will lap up and non-owners will resent not being able to play, perhaps through no lack of trying. Miles Morales and Demon’s Souls were superb launch titles for the PS5, but we’re now through the looking glass. The bar has been set. The PS5 has arrived.",,"Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is a stunner. It not only gives the latest generation of consoles a game that looks as beautiful as the improved tech promised, but it’s also a fantastic experience to play. Insomniac has been around the Ratchet and Clank block plenty of times before, but Rivet and other new characters add so much charm, wit, and heart to a franchise I’ve loved for most of my life. That’s coupled with series-best action-platforming gameplay and incredible art and sound design across the board. Rift Apart may not be the biggest adventure around, but its big heart, wild weapons, and incredible detail easily make it one of the most memorable of the year so far.",,,"Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is every bit the shining gem in the PS5 launch crown. There are a couple of extremely minor drawbacks in the form of a sometimes-cluttered screen, the sense of humour taking more of a backseat, and some very rare crashes, but Rift Apart delivers one of the strongest entries in the franchise to date.",,,,"A certain level of scrappiness can be charming, but it’s harder to excuse in a big-budget project like this one, and three crashes in an hour is far too scrappy to be overlooked. Still, I do have a fondness for Rift Apart, perhaps because I do get the sense that this was a project built with love, yet not so much love that it wasn’t willing to experiment and try some new things. Once all the many, many bugs are fixed, this’ll be a pretty good game for families to enjoy, and a superb showcase for what the PS5 is capable of.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is another action adventure triumph for PlayStation and Insomniac Games. It’s got a world that’s so full of colour and life, lovable new characters who bring clever diversity to a well-established cast, and an ever-changing gameplay loop that’s downright fun and engaging. Even if the game panders a little too heavily to a younger audience for my taste, it still excels in enough areas to make this an easy recommendation for nostalgic fans and newcomers alike.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is the first game I’ve played since the ninth-generation consoles launched that feels like a true next-gen title. Insomniac Games has done everything that it needed to do in making both a sequel to its longest-running franchise and a true next-gen exclusive. While it might not technically be a PlayStation 5 launch title, it feels like one—a real preview of the console’s capabilities. But beyond that, Rift Apart is just an absolute blast to play.","Insomniac Games delivered a plethora of good or very good entertainment over the years, but this Ratchet & Clank is an animated masterpiece - some kind of Super Lombax Galaxy at the highest level.",,,"Insomniac hits another homerun with Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart. Another epic adventure with the Lombax and his trusty robot as they go to save the universe. Full of beautiful colors, incredible designs, and tremendously fun gameplay, it is something that cannot be ignored for both newcomers and longtime fans.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a fun and charming adventure with good level design and better movement options. Just like other Insomniac’s projects it can feel derivative and safe, but that doesn’t take away from its quality.","Ratchet & Clank: Drift Apart is a visual masterpiece and a joyful game, that unfortunately fails to reinvent itself and is a bit too predictable.","It is undeniable that Insomniac Games is a studio with talented developers and this Ratchet & Clank: A Rift Apart proves it to us all along. We can regret a slightly light lifespan and a rift system that is more timid than what was announced. Nevertheless, it's hard to deny that the final rendering is breathtaking and that the game wouldn't have the same flavor on PS4, which explains its exclusivity on PS5. This impression of playing a game with a quality worthy of a Pixar Studios animated film (or even better), with so much generosity in its gameplay and content, coupled with the addition of new rich and worked characters, propels the title to the level of must-have games on PlayStation 5 and as one of the pillars of the shooter-platformer genre.","I had a smile on my face most of the way through Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart. It’s a great continuation of the series that is just a joy to play. It steals your eye with its stunning vistas, makes you care about the characters, and is loaded to the hilt with fan service (especially in the alternate dimension and a weapon you have to assemble). Insomniac clearly had a blast working on this game and leaves us with a tease for an even bigger adventure right before the credits roll.",,"It doesn’t reinvent the wheel but it makes sure that the wheel provides the smoothest experience you can get. This is the Ratchet and Clank you’ve grown to love over the years brought into a new generation of gaming. Fans of the original series will love it and fans of platformers will definitely find something they enjoy. It has its flaws but with collectables to find, side quests to complete, a story full of great moments and more it’s a game that will keep you entertained until the very end.","With over a dozen games in the long-running series, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart still manages to feel fresh and exciting, taking full advantage of the PlayStation 5 by delivering what, for many, may be their first taste at a definitive next-gen feeling game for the still-budding platform.","I would like to fill this box with ""buy it, it's awesome!"", like Jack Torrance and his ""all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"". There would be nothing more to say but it wouldn't sound professional. So I’m going to talk about frantic and fun action, tons of enemies to obliterate in the most creative ways, intriguing story, no loading times, intuitive and reactive controls, PS5 hardware that finally proves its mettle, puzzles to solve, battles down to the last hitpoint, planets to explore, mounts to ride, secrets to discover, weapons to upgrade, armors to collect, oh dear I ran out of characters, so buy it, it's awesome.",,,Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart doesn’t try to teach an old Lombax too many new tricks. The core of the series still works and is a ton of fun to play. The PS5 provides just enough to make it feel fresh while new friends provide new possibilities. I’m glad to say that the team at Insomniac has this iconic duo back on track. There’s no better game to show off the power of the PS5.,"Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart is a powerhouse demonstration of what the PS5 can do. A rich, vibrantly-lit world stuffed with things to find as you enjoy an engaging story, all of which sets the stage for future games.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is everything we wanted from this long-awaited sequel: fast and entertaining action with a great deal of nostalgia. This truly is action-packed, somewhat brain-dead, platform entertainment at its best.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart offers an amazing adventure with its action structure, entertaining story, dialogues and graphics.","Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is this year's summer blockbuster on PS5. Taking players through diverse and gorgeous worlds with excellent combat and platforming, Rift Apart is a ton of fun to play.","Not THE astounding next-gen hit you might expect - and the gameplay ain't exempt of minor faults here and there -, Ratchet 1 Clank Rift Apart is nonetheless an excellent game and a must have for every PS5 player.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is an exceptional entry in the storied franchise. It doesn’t reinvent the series, but instead uses Insomniac's decades of experience to create a familiar and refined take on the universe. Newcomer Rivet is immediately relatable and a great addition to the wonderful cast. Modern technology like the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller and SSD enrich the experience of exploration and combat. Whether you’ve been following the series since 2002, or you’re just hopping in for the first time, Rift Apart is a must-play summer blockbuster.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart delivers a true next-gen experience thanks to its stunning visuals, haptic controls, and blazing-fast load times. Thrilling combat, expansive levels, and memorable characters make this PlayStation 5 exclusive an essential purchase.","Whether you've had adventures with Ratchet & Clank in the past or not, Rift Apart is not a game to be missed. It's one of the best games you can get for your PS5 and one of the best games of 2021 so far, period.","Easily the best Ratchet & Clank game in the series, Rift Apart also manages to be the most technically and graphically impressive game of the current generation so far.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is flashy and technically impressive without feeling self-important. It's just as silly, sweet, and earnest as the Ratchet & Clank series tends to be, while the new generation of hardware makes this entry look and play better than ever. Like the heroes and villains and their dimensional counterparts, this one may appear different or carry itself with a new accent, but there's an underlying truth to the person underneath. At its core, it's still your trusty old pals on another grand space adventure. That's what's important.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is ultimately a visual showcase for the PlayStation 5, a thrilling dimension-hopping adventure, and a next-gen experience that feels like it could only exist - in this form - right now. In an age where realistic visuals, that is real-world settings and characters with proportional features to our own, are often the barometer for fidelity, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart reminds us that a heightened animated or cartoon-like look can offer a greater sense of immersion and believability than just about anything else.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is easily the best game that the PlayStation 5 now has to offer. From top to bottom, it offers an experience that is practically faultless and keeps you from ever wanting to put the controller down. Not only is Rift Apart itself superb, but as a showcase for what the PS5 is capable of, it’s likely the best example we have seen so far and continues to verify that Insomniac Games is one of the best studios in the world.","Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is one of the best entries in the series to date. It really showcases the power of Sony’s new console, especially with the SSD loading times and switching between dimensions.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is an exemplary PS5 game, showing full well what the system is capable of — all while masterfully reviving a beloved series for the new generation.","A brilliant return to the old-age of PlayStation. Unapologetically fun, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, is relentless with the charm and the action. A must-play for anyone who’s managed to beat a scalper to get a PlayStation 5.","A Rift Apart is entirely what you expect from a new Ratchet and Clank adventure. It’s a joyous, stunning, playable Saturday morning cartoon, providing a generous helping of family-friendly blasting. And that’s both its biggest strength and its greatest weakness. Despite its incredibly slick exterior, there’s little new gameplay wise to really push the envelope or surprise players. Where the constant reinvention of a Mario title keeps the gameplay feeling fresh by bombarding the player with new mechanics, a Rift Apart instead relies on visual splendour for its variation, wowing you with a string of setpieces between repeated sections of familiar-feeling gameplay. Those that came away from its initial reveal wowed at its Rift-based premise will leave bitterly disappointed. Still, that’s not to say that there isn’t fun to be had here – and when everything looks this good, it’s easy to forgive a bit of repetition.","Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is another great PS5 exclusive that really shows what the hardware is capable of. It’s a visually detailed platformer filled with three Iron Man movies worth of thrills. The shooting suffers a bit due to some overeager DualSense integration that’s a literal pain, but Insomniac has created a colorful blockbuster that’s loaded with good, old-fashioned comic mischief.","Rift Apart’s greatest weakness is that it never truly utilises the brilliance of its dimension-shifting rift mechanics. You see a glimpse of the full potential at the start of the game, but then it sort of… disappears a little. You hop from planet to planet having a lot of fun, but there isn’t the shifting world design that you might expect to continue from its fabulously inventive introduction. This is still a big, beautiful, bombastic adventure with action, humour and heart aplenty, not to mention impeccable looks and craft that take full advantage of PS5. It is a game you should definitively play, but for all its flash and colour Rift Apart does – just occasionally – settle for the one dimension. Thankfully, it’s one you want to visit.",,"Despite its ostensibly far-flung setting, Ratchet And Clank: Rift Apart is going to feel very familiar to anyone who’s spent much time with this franchise over the last two decades of its existence. That’s a bit of a bummer, in so far as there are a lot of Ratchet And Clank games out there that you can draw parallels to here, and very little that’s going to feel genuinely fresh or new. But that familiarity also extends to being familiar with the core, unshakeable competence of these solid platforming adventures that are designed for pretty much anyone to have a good time with. As a dimension-hopping adventure, Rift Apart might leave something to be desired. But as a reunion with one of gaming’s most energetically silly franchises, after so many years away, there are worse things you could wish for than the same old Ratchet And Clank.","For the most part, Rift Apart doesn’t stray far from what has made Ratchet & Clank so enduring. The formula remains the same: silly characters, great graphics, and lots of interesting guns to play with. But virtually every element is better than it’s ever been, from the touching-if-goofy story to the frantic action set pieces. And through this Rift Apart becomes a showcase for why someone might go through all the trouble to secure a PS5. It shows how more detailed worlds and faster load times can elevate a tried-and-true formula — and it might even make you care about Lombax lore in the process.","One of the first real reasons to buy PS5. This intergalactic adventure of famous series is full of great gameplay, inventive game design, gripping story, and great characters. It's a game for everyone who owns PS5. Actually, it’s a game for everyone.","Delivering a pitch-perfect blend of cinematic spectacle and cartoony fast-paced action, while also providing the most impressive showpiece yet for the PlayStation 5 hardware, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart looks, sounds and feels like a truly next-generation game. That it does this while also offering the exact same high level of heart, imagination and endearing characterisation we’ve come to expect from Insomniac Games is just as impressive.","Through outstanding storytelling, exquisite visuals, and gripping gameplay, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart proves to be an engaging, fun, funny, and thoroughly enjoyable return to the series. It also offers the introduction to two brand new characters that could arguably be the protagonists of their own spin-off or at least return to future entries in the series. For fans and new players alike, this is a game I would recommend for everybody and a true showing of the sort of titles we should expect for the new generation.",Ratchet and Clank: Rift is the perfect sequel to the series' reboot. Its two protagonists return in top form with a fun adventure that makes the most of the technology of PlayStation 5. An essential part of the catalog of the new Sony console.,"This is one of the busiest platformers ever made, a game so over-eager to keep you on your toes and revitalize tired play mechanics for a next-gen world that it sometimes distances players from the same classic fun it’s fighting so hard to preserve. While “Rift Apart” is ecstatic proof that Ratchet still has what it takes to be a hero, it works so hard to argue that gaming’s past can exist alongside its future that the present can sometimes get lost in the shuffle along the way.",,,,"I think it's impossible to put down your controller once you finish Rift Apart for the first time, and not have a smile on your face. It's a game that's chicken soup for the soul, nourishing and positive content that's just incredibly wholesome to consume. Loud with its setpiece moments and surprisingly introspective with its emotional haymakers, all of its style and substance comes together to create not only a colourful, and wonderfully mad showcase for the PS5, but also the definitive Ratchet and Clank adventure for the next generation of gaming.",,,,"The experience is so captivating, you’ll probably want to blast through the entire 10-15 hour story in one go. But the final is really disappointing: basically, the entire game is just a warm-up, while the important events will happen in the next one. [Issue#254, p.36]","I finished Rift Apart a few days ago, but my saved game says I've played 98% of Rift Apart, with a few collectibles left to be swept up. You can bet your ass I'm gonna get that last 2%.","As the first entirely new Ratchet & Clank in almost eight years, and the latest entry in one of the defining franchises of the PS2, Rift Apart had a big legacy to live up to. But boy, does it manage to step into those magneboots, delivering a decidedly modern game that creatively pushes technical boundaries, while also being grounded firmly in the joyful, playful design philosophy of that golden age of 3D platformers. Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart feels like something from an alternate dimension where that early 2000s style of platformer design never went out of vogue.","After an iffy PS4 entry, Rift Apart delivers the full-on next generation experience for series fans and newcomers alike. It’s the best showcase game the PS5 has had yet and makes the on-board SSD shine in ways that truly impress when you take a step back to soak in just what’s happening in real-time.",,,,,,,,"There was a kind of magic in the early Ratchet & Clank games, and then a competence in the later lesser games. The frenetic onscreen chaos of wacky cartoon monsters, smashed crates, imaginative gunplay, and a swarm of bouncing coins was a true joy as we all discovered it twenty years ago. These days, it’s all on offer in a hundred different games. But without the magic or at least the competence, it’s just a flurry of sloppy colors and shapes, a whirlwind of ineffectual nostalgia, absent any innovation, creativity, confidence, or finesse. It took many years, but now that it’s being used to prop up a piece of hardware, Ratchet & Clank finally feels like the soulless corporate property it’s become.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it-takes-two,"Time and again, It Takes Two finds new ways to demonstrate how vital communication and effort are in getting two individuals on the same page. It even riffs on classic toys like the Etch A Sketch and See ‘n Say, as well as seminal video games (like Mario Kart’s Rainbow Road, Crash Bandicoot’s chase sequences, or Diablo’s isometric combat), to bring that message to us. But even when it isn’t toying with our nostalgia and just reveling in the sublimely ridiculous, the game is sneakily, delicately balancing our desire to remain kids at heart with the reality of our adult responsibilities. That’s a valuable lesson, and it’s one that the developers at Hazelight deliver without making it feel like they’re tasking us with grown-up homework.",,,,"It Takes Two is not only a wonderful co-op experience, it’s a genuine masterpiece of platforming and interactive storytelling. Every moment my partner and I were playing this game was filled with pure joy, and it became the perfect way to cap off our days for the last few weeks. It Takes Two is arguably one of the greatest games I’ve played in years.",It Takes Two is an incredible game thanks to its ingenious and addictive gameplay and its fresh and neat universe. Josef Fares has a real gift for offering experiences in successful cooperation but here he sets the bar very high with a multitude of brilliant ideas at the heart of a touching and well-told story. A must to share without moderation!,,,,,,,"Hazelight further hones its craft as ambitious creators of unique co-op experiences with It Takes Two. A clever, inventive procession of ideas and concepts that gel together to form a spellbinding co-op game.",,,,,,,,Quotation forthcoming.,,"It Takes Two is co-op gaming genius and is going to go down as both a classic of the genre and a Game of the Year contender. There's not a single dull moment in the entire game, and we didn't run into any glitches or technical issues of any kind either. It Takes Two is polished to near-perfection, and an absolute must-play for co-op gaming fans.","It Takes Two has so much to give for players seeking a deeper connection or just an enjoyable, varied game. When Cody and May’s journey reaches its emotional crescendo, there shouldn’t be a dry eye on the couch. Tucked beneath a hilarious script is a beating heart of human connection, one that is easily shared between the players and their digital counterparts. Few games are able to successfully bridge the gulf between narrative and gameplay like this. It Takes Two is a brilliant fusion of creativity, placing itself at the front of the best games of 2021. More importantly, however, it’s an experience that may teach you and your co-op partner a lot about yourselves, bringing you closer than ever before.","It Takes Two is, without a doubt, the best co-op game you can play right now. It’s much more ambitious and bigger budget than A Way Out, which was still brilliant in its own way. Josef Fares and the team at Hazelight take things to the next level here, and I can only imagine what they’ll do when they’re inevitably given a triple-A budget. Grab a friend by the hand and pull them through an adventure unlike any other as soon as you can - you won’t regret it.","It Takes Two is a Pixar-worthy adventure that consistently innovates, offering players an excellent co-op experience unlike any other.",,"Some publishers may feel couch co-op isn't viable anymore, but It Takes Two proves just how powerful the setup can be with the right blend of gameplay and charm.",,"With its relentless stream of clever ideas, It Takes Two is one of the most memorable and inventive co-op games of the modern era. Just make sure your partner knows their way around a DualSense controller.","It Takes Two improves on previous Hazelights games, setting aside cinematics and betting on 'a game that has been rebuilt onto a toy'. Gameplay-wise the game is excellent: it has a ton of variety, and it is as surprising as fun until the very end. Nevertheless, the story itself is unable to properly talk about love or relationships in any way, and so it kind of puts a dent on a work that would otherwise have been a must-play experience.","I adore A Way Out, so I had really high expectations for Hazelight’s new game. Instead of sticking to the proven, perfect formula of AWO, the developers decided to give us more of everything and as a result overdid it in many respects. The levels are too long and there are too many minigames, while the story can’t keep up. It seemed to me the narrative is just a pretext to introduce as many different gameplay mechanics as possible, and as a result the relationship between the protagonists is implausible. [05/2021, p.26]",,,"It Takes Two is one of the most delightful and ceaselessly entertaining co-op games I’ve played. Hazelight offers so many exciting levels, abilities, set-pieces, and mini-games, but does not let this extreme level of variety affect its quality. Every new idea is introduced to the game with care and used in a way that players can enjoy, before promptly being recycled out for an even better one. That this is the developer’s first platformer is staggeringly impressive, and I can only hope that this won’t be its final flirtation with a genre it’s clearly head over heels for.",,"It Takes Two is a charming, playful, tight, and extremely varied platformer which manages to stay fresh hour after hour, in a way few other games can.","I struggle to think of another co-op puzzle game that's better. Maybe Portal 2? Even if that's true, It Takes Two belongs on that same tier.",,"With It Takes Two, Hazelight has cemented itself as one of the most creative and talented developers of today. Not only does It Takes Two look absolutely fantastic, it’s a delight to play and its story is wonderful; sometimes moving, sometimes utterly hilarious. It’s essentially your own interactive Pixar movie – co-op gaming really doesn’t get any better than this.",,,,,"It Takes Two is an amazing game that keeps players on their toes with its impeccable pacing in both story and gameplay. This 3D platformer mixes genres every step of the way in a magical ride through different locals. At the center, though, is a great love story full of heartwarming moments and plenty of laughs to boot.",,"It Takes Two is a dazzling adventure filled with more mechanics than you can shake a stick at. Working together throughout the mesmerizing set of levels is compelling and full of hearty chuckles, but sadly the story falls short of that bar with inconsistent tone and a lack of perceptible character growth along the way. It’s still well worth your time and energy, just don’t expect to be as emotionally invested in the journey as you might have been with Hazelight’s past work.",,,,,,,"It Takes Two is one of the most unique games I’ve played in a long time. The heartfelt story can be really dark at times, but does it’s job to reinforce the narrative. There aren’t many co-op games on the market, and none of them do what It Takes Two does, with each bit of the platforming gameplay being tons of fun and adding enjoyable new techniques as you make your way through each level. It may be tough to lock someone down for fifteen hours to play it, and even then I feel like I’m reaching for this as a con, but if you find someone that wants to play It Takes Two with, you probably won’t want to put down the controller.","While it has some story pains, make no mistake: It Takes Two is a fantastic game and a welcome 2021 surprise. Grab a friend or loved one; find a co-worker or bridge buddy. Regardless of who you pair up with, this is one adventure you'll want to share together.",,"It Takes Two is one of the most special games that you will play in a long time. In pandemic times when it's still difficult to meet a friend face-to-face or play side by side in an coach, there's no better cooperative experience than It Takes Two.","Although the story of Cody and May doesn’t meet the standards set by the game’s varied gameplay, It Takes Two sees the continued form of Josef Fares and his team at Hazelight in crafting wonderfully creative and engaging worlds for players to share and collaborate in. It Takes Two is a co-op experience that’s second to none, which offers more ways than you can imagine to experience these larger than life play spaces.",,"It Takes Two is a fantastic coop-adventure, that overwhelmed us with its creative and fun gameplay ideas.","It Takes Two is a cooperative gaming experience like no other. Its gameplay sometimes takes a back seat to the overall spectacle of the adventure but even when that happens, it's hard not to enjoy every minute of this incredible journey.",,,,"It Takes Two is an amazing coop experience, a rollercoaster of love that always succeeds in giving new gameplay mechanics to players, as well as interesting characters. A true playable romantic comedy that lasts 10 hours that will leave some pretty good memories. And another success for Hazelight.",,"It Takes Two is one of the best co-op games we've ever played. The creativity is splashing and the adventure is incredibly entertaining thanks to the mix of all kinds of elements, locations and situations. It plays wonderfully and the variation in environments does the game well as it provides a good surprise effect, and does so time and time again. The presentation is also sublime with razor-sharp graphics that are incredibly colorful and that is complemented by a wonderful soundtrack that connects seamlessly with everything.","Alas, what should be a runaway creative success for the game’s director, Josef Fares, is marred by a tone-deaf narrative element which shows that asinine ethnic caricatures unfortunately still exist in video games.","It Takes Two is an excellent co-op adventure. While it stumbles on certain narrative aspects and not all the performances are winners, it more than makes up for that with its brilliantly fun and ever-changing gameplay. Forcing two players to work in tandem in countless ways, the game embraces co-op play wholeheartedly, and the variety of gameplay and environments makes it a joy to play from start to finish.",,"It Takes Two is full of ideas and it’s, unquestionably, the best cooperative game for two players out there. The environments and puzzles change frequently enough to keep things fresh, the only slight disappointment being a rather weak story.",,"A joyful, colourful, and hugely inventive cavalcade of co-op antics that makes superb use of having two players for both its unique challenges and unscripted hijinks.","It is enchanting, funny and terribly refreshing.",,,"It Takes Two is endlessly creative. Gameplay speaks to narrative, while narrative informs gameplay, and the entire experience just feels incredibly polished and detailed. It nails relationships in ways that so many games—and even other forms of media—just can’t. It asks the player to engage with the the story through mandatory co-op to tell the tale of a couple on the verge of divorce, rediscovering the good in their relationship. It’s not just one of the best action platformers in recent memory, but also a fantastic and unique story representing a dynamic that you don’t often see represented in games, at least not to this depth and nuance.",,,,"It Takes Two is a thoroughly entertaining and engaging cooperative journey that constantly throws interesting new mechanics and gameplay ideas into the mix. Its narrative shortcomings are disappointing, but the stylish visuals and detailed sound design make for an impressive presentation.","It Takes Two is a true couple therapy in which the two players (mandatory coop) will have to work together to overcome a large variety of challenges and activities. The overall feel of the game is very refreshing, but some minor flaws are still there (like poorly balanced minigames).",,,,,,,,,,,"Though some may be disappointed that its story never capitalizes on its full potential, It Takes Two is a masterpiece of creativity and cooperative gameplay that makes it one of the most memorable experiences in modern gaming.",,,,"It Takes Two is a beautiful and exciting co-op experience, that can potentially mean so much more for those who relate to this premise. Working together is not always the issue in a relationship, sometimes you just don’t get along. Across all the jumps, boss battles, and deadly puzzles, we get to witness this couple’s journey.

Sweetening the deal even further is the fact that only one person needs to own the game for two people to play it online. You can’t ask for anything more than that.",,,,"It Takes Two is a spectacular co-op adventure that lays down a path of great gameplay ideas and uses it to play a giddy game of hopscotch. It’s beautiful, breakneck-paced, and bubbling over with creativity, and playfulness and experimentation are rewarded at every turn.

Just like in their previous games, the whole adventure revolves around cooperation, but this time in a much more charming and almost excessively varied form - where it sometimes can feel like we are thrown between completely different games. But somehow, the adventure never feels disjointed, rather the opposite. Right from the start, both the world and the gameplay feels perfectly synchronized, and it is a joy to tackle all the obstacles that stand in our way.","We have a game that deserves all the praise with its gameplay dynamics, storytelling and most importantly, its dynamic structure from the beginning to the end.",,,,,,"A fun, gorgeous platforming romp that makes great use of its split screen-only twist in both gameplay and narrative.

deathloop,Deathloop brings a considerable measure of liveliness to the by now moth-eaten concept of the time loop.,,,"At the beginning of the game, and every morning since, Colt wakes up with a single objective: break the loop. But we're increasingly starting to sympathize with Juliana. Why would you want to do that, when there's still so much to play around with? [Issue#364, p.98]","In the end, Deathloop is a pretty decent ride with a fantastic sense of style and a lot of freedom for players to experience Colt’s story as they see fit. However, the overall experience is shaken by a surprising amount of bugs, braindead enemy artificial intelligence, lackluster PVP and by-design repetition as Colt works to piece together the mystery of Blackreef. I largely enjoyed my time, though I was very ready for Colt’s day to end as I neared the campaign’s finale, and it’s unlikely I’ll be looping back into the game for more any time soon.","Deathloop is an excellent game with a very neat universe and intelligent mechanics that make the experience addictive. The gameplay is perfect and the multiple possibilities at the heart of the different neighborhoods and hours of the day make it possible to never get bored; on the contrary, it is extremely satisfying to advance and progress through the failures. The powers and the way we improve are awesome and make this game a real nugget. Bravo Arkane!","Deathloop is a very well crafted game that can be appealing to the majority of players, especially the fans of action and stealth genres. A solid gameplay structure combined with a mysterious story, beautiful visuals, memorable voice acting and very high replay values make the final package a must have.","Deathloop offers a fun, time bending romp. The story is intriguing and the characters, butterfly effects and abilities are the strong points only hampered by a lot of repetition and the odd technical hitch.","Rich in detail and brilliantly designed, Deathloop brings new life into a familiar story trope. It's polished game mechanics help Deathloop remain intriguing and challenging at all times, which makes it a paramount addition to the new PS5 game library.","Deathloop is another proof that Arkane knows its immersive sim stuff. Despite the disappointing AI and some serious PC port issues, it still is one of the most fun experiences you can afford yourself this year and a breath of fresh air in the industry.","For all of its complexities under the hood, Deathloop is Arkane’s most accessible game yet and elicits constant satisfaction. The action is a pleasure, while its main drive has you constantly picking up pieces of an unknown puzzle that are pieced together in separate chunks, before the frisson of excitement when the full picture starts to form. What’s extraordinary is how Arkane make it seem so easy. Blockbuster game-making at its smartest and most essential.",,"Deathloop is not only one of the most conceptually ambitious and well executed games ever made, but Arkane's PlayStation swansong also has a boundless energy and ingenuity that no other game can match. Quite simply, Deathloop is an unparalleled synergy of first-person shooter design, explorative bliss and narrative complexity that we likely won't see again for a very, very long time.","Deathloop is Arkane at its best, combining its system-driven immersive-sim gameplay with a unique and fascinating story set-up. Excellent presentation and style, along with fantastic dialogue and character performances makes Deathloop one of the most innovative games in years and a valuable PS5 exclusive.","A unique and intriguing way to present the idea of time travel in a game. If you're a fan of this concept like me, you will love this objective based first person gift from Arkane.","Those of us who love to get into the game, learn more about its world and eavesdrop, read emails on terminals and rack our brains to get into places without being shot at, are in luck: with Deathloop we have a great game for a while.","Is Deathloop perfect? For that, the story is a bit too slow to start, at times you are led by the hand just a little too much, and there were still too many bugs in our review copy. But that can be solved with patches and updates, and the pace does not detract from this intelligent and well-crafted murder puzzle. Let's hope it's the first of its kind.",,,,Deathloop is one of the most complex and elegant ways of video game design. Arkane Studios reinvented their own formula in an impressive new immersive sim title.,,"Deathloop is one of the best games of 2021 and one of the best PS5 console exclusives so far. Arkane has hit it out of the park yet again, with the PS5 getting yet another must-have title for its growing library of exclusive games. Deathloop may be too easy and there's definitely some tedium tied to the time loop, but most of the time players will be having so much fun that they'll easily be able to overlook its few shortcomings.","Deathloop is a fascinating and brilliant game. It subverts expectations out of the gate, providing players with a deep mystery that is solved by compelling, diverse gameplay. While being similar to Arkane’s previous work, it is almost like anything else you may have played while still housing familiar, recognizable elements. A whirlwind of intrigue, action, and style crafts Deathloop into a melting pot of smart, bold choices. Thankfully, Deathloop transcends its shackles as an amalgamation of “Arkane’s Greatest Hits” by offering players a thrilling take on shooters. Combat puzzles involving webs of untruths and harrowing escapes turn Blackreef into a time loop you won’t want to break from. And a definitive candidate for one of the best shooters in years.","Deathloop feels like your first bite of a cheesecake after being stranded on a desert island and living off seaweed for six months. In a sea of shotgun-spread triple-A games that are all too familiar, Deathloop is a precision 50. cal bullet of originality right through your eye socket.",Deathloop is a killer new-generation showcase that will keep you guessing until the very end.,"Deathloop is a game that takes the ideas driving the immersive sim genre to new heights. Purists may take issue with the way it breaks from some of the genre's traditions, but what it offers instead is something unlike anything else out there: a cleverly implemented time loop system that feeds into everything else, and opens the doors to a whole lot of new opportunities for the creative problem solving that sits at the heart of these games. That it does it all with a sense of style and confidence that few other games can match is icing on the cake.","For fans of the modern Hitman series, Arkane's outstanding catalog, and great-feeling FPS games in general, Deathloop is highly recommended.",,"Deathloop is slick and inventive, with a delicious sense of style and humour. It distils Arkane’s hefty systems into something more explicitly playful, then leaves its sparkling cast to run riot in its huge interlocking puzzle of an island. One of the smartest and most outright entertaining games of the year.","Deathloop follows the same pattern regarding the most characteristic elements to be found on Arkane's portfolio: a superb level design, an exceptional gameplay, an interesting story and an artistic element nothing short of spectacular. A magnificent game with but a few 'but' that has managed to completely hook me from beginning to end.","I’m honestly surprised, because I did not expect to have so much fun with Deathloop. It draws some gameplay ideas from Dishonored, but introduces time-related mechanics, offers an intriguing story with interesting characters and has its own unique and coherent style. It’s an original game, full of surprises and addictive, but not necessarily easily digestible for everyone. For me however it’s one of the best titles of 2021. [11/2021, p.22]",Deathloop is an awesomely entertaining ride with stealth and puzzle elements that help make it feel like the big crazy sci-fi adventure it wants to be.,Deathloop combines a classic Arkane stealthy-shooty foundation with a genuinely interesting and fun premise.,"Unfortunately, the weak recon missions made too easy by the lack of challenge from AI enemies, the small number of maps that are quickly mastered, and the limited variety in gameplay burdened by uninspired upgrades, ultimately prevent Deathloop from reaching the highest of highs. With online multiplayer enabled and embraced, however, it becomes easier to overlook the weak points and Deathloop comes out on the other side as a compelling lesson in how intimate multiplayer can greatly enhance the single-player formula.","Consistency is the mother of mastery. And DEATHLOOP is another consistent release of Arkane Studios. For newcomers this game can serve as a great entry point to the Arkane portfolio. While all the hadcore fans will surely get what they expect from this title, even with this new and experimental format. There's no better place for experiments than in the endless time loop, after all.",Playing Deathloop is a joy in almost every way. Arkane Studios has successfully built upon what made their earlier games good and made something that feel both unique and stylish.,"Deathloop is one of the best games of the year — at least from what I’ve played so far. And I say that as someone who has previously recognized the quality of Arkane games while struggling to enjoy them. But with this game, French team Arkane Lyon used some smart tricks to amplify its strengths. And the result is a special experience that has broader appeal than some other Arkane projects.",,"There’s a hell of a lot to love about Deathloop. It’s seriously slick; taking control of Colt as he runs, slides, sneaks or climbs through an environment feels incredible. It’s a game that entrusts players to engage with its systems in their own way, and while you’ll never be at a loss on what to do, you won’t have your hand held, either. It’s fast, it’s smooth, it’s incredibly good fun. Chances are, you really won’t want the loop to end.","Deathloop is one of the finest, most unique experiences in the video game space in recent memory. Sure, it’s got that familiar Arkane feel, but the amalgamation of all of Deathloop’s various influences, genuinely comedic writing, great voice acting, intricate level design, and an engaging, mysterious story that unfolds as you play make Deathloop an absolute joy to play.","Glitches like these will be ironed out with a patch, luckily, and Deathloop is definitely for the gamers who rootle around for the secrets in games. Here, though, every scrap of paper and scoop weakens the chains that keep Blackreef suspended in time. As your experience grows of the ins and outs of the island, you'll maximise the hours you have and become a force unto yourself, shuffling Eternalists off their mortal coil in creative ways. All of this feels fantastic, so hats off to Arkane for setting themselves and the players an exciting, rewarding, and ambitious challenge that they won't forget.",Deathloop is a magnificently unstructured FPS filled with loads of weapons and abilities that never stops being fun.,"The things is, you don’t have to think about anything if you don’t want to; you can just enjoy the adrenaline rush, blasting symbolic victims of player violence (enemies even disappear in a whirl of multicoloured light when shot, a self-reflexive reference to the sheer disposability of non-player characters). But a darker subtext is always there, if you want to look beneath the gleaming surface...In this way, Deathloop gets to have its cake and eat it – over and over again. And it is, to be fair, absolutely delicious.","Deathloop proves that the concept of Groundhog Day also works in games. The story is phenomenal, mostly thanks due to the excellent voice-acting. Arkane focuses again on stealth, but also gives the play more options for all-out warfare, with a plethora of guns, special powers, and upgrades. The stay on Blackreef Island can get a little bit repetitive after multiple time loops, but the island itself is beautifully crafted, and the ending makes it all worth it. Arkane once again hit it out of the park.","Although there are some elements from Dishonored in the game, Arkane Studios delivers a unique FPS, with great characters an intriguing story and a wise use of time loops. There are some technical issues here and there, but we loved the experience.","If you thought Groundhog Day would have been even more awesome with guns and assassinations or that Dishonored would have been a better game if only Quentin Tarantino had directed it, you’d probably enjoy Deathloop. Despite some issues with pacing, bugs, AI, and mechanical clarity, Deathloop is smart, funny, intricately designed, and driven by engaging action, cool puzzles, and relative freedom to approach its objectives in various ways. Deathloop is an addictive and rewarding shooter and one of the most ambitious action games this year.","Deathloop is one of the best works from Arkane Studios. An adventure that relies on trial and error, level repetition and pure emergent exploration to discover all the secrets of the loop and the story of Colt and Julianna. A PS5 must-have (right now) that proves Arkane always knows what it's doing.",There’s a lot to enjoy here and the banter between Colt and Julianna is entertaining in and of itself… Colt starting out being very unsure of himself (not even knowing who he is to start with) to (re)gaining his confidence and going on the offensive. There’s a lot of swearing and a lot of blood shed so this clearly isn’t for the younger gamers or those who are sensitive to such things… but for the rest of us this is a lot of fun!,,,,"Deathloop was an awe-inspiring experience, and as such, it's a guaranteed candidate to the Game of the Year award. The game brings everything you can wish for - a great story, a world full of secrets begging to be discovered, unique characters, satisfying combat and puzzles, and timeless audiovisuals. Instant classic.","Deathloop is a great game, if kind of a mixed bag in ways. On one hand, the gameplay is some of the most refined Arkane has done, and they give you almost an “easy mode roguelite” to play, along with a little opposition via co-op for spice. On the other however, the story can stumble, and the grind can be a bit too monotonous. Deathloop walks a bit of a fine line, but overall has enough fun ideas to keep things mostly fresh and fun for Colt and Julianna players alike.","Deathloop is an engaging and enjoyable game that manages to capture the feel of Dishonored in a more fast-paced adventure. The unique setting and engaging concept carry the game through the repetitive nature of the gameplay. The multiplayer at the center of the story is more of a mixed bag but still intriguing enough to be memorable. Some annoying bugs drag down the experience. If you liked Dishonored but wished it were less about stealth and more about blowing things up, then Deathloop is the game for you. Just be prepared to die again and again.","Deathloop is a bizarre fever-dream that's too fun to wake up from. An absurd, retrofuturistic murder-mystery where you don't solve the murders, but commit them. Leave it to Arkane Studios to make such a surreal world feel real.","A game with a remarkable finish that we will enjoy and remember. A good buy, highly recommended for lovers of the genre. It is well cared for at all levels.","It’s not an easy thing Arkane has done here in serving up a genuinely fresh take on one of the medium’s most enduring genres. Deathloop redefines what a shooter can be, and the developer has used their entire toolkit to get there. Satisfying action, world-building that’s second-to-none, style and substance, and a genuinely enthralling riddle at the centre, Deathloop delivers it all. And it’s through these triumphs that Deathloop earns its place in the first-person shooter pantheon, and puts its hand up during Game of the Year talks.",,"Deathloop has an innovative game concept, a gripping narrative and it's spiced up with Arkane Studios' customary strong points.",,,"So to experience all the good of Deathloop you need also suck it up and suffer a bit of bad. Nothing too stinky, just enough to make you intermittently wrinkle your nose. But it’s worth it. Arkane’s newest isn’t perfect, but I suspect it will end up one of the most memorable games of 2021 simply because it’s so unlike everything out there at the moment. In a season of sequels and various licensed properties, it’s a treat to get to play something as original and unexpected as this.","Deathloop is far from being the sum of my worst fears, but it went into a direction that does turn it into a mixed experience. There are some good ideas in the game, but repetition kills most of the fun. Still, it is not a bad game. If you have the patience to put together the story you will find it quite appealing, the level design is as brilliant as ever, but on the other hand the maps are really small, and the combat system is half baked. Overall if you expect another Prey or Dishonored you will be disappointed, but if you are looking for an action game that is quirky and different you might have fun with it.",,,"New and refreshing, Arkane Studios delivers quite a unique experience with Deathloop. Expert level design, interesting targets and a wide variety of gameplay options make for one hell of a title. And it looks great to boot! Some technical imperfections should be mentioned, however… as well as the bit underwhelming experience that is playing as Julianna. Nothing is perfect though, right?","I never felt any urgency to break the time loop since everyone in the world — even Colt — is pretty blithe about going through the motions from one loop to the next. Alas, I find it difficult to imagine anyone who isn’t partial to video game tropes loving Deathloop. Unless you’re particularly drawn to its vibe, it’s a shooter with good mechanics but not much more than that.","Few games have the confidence and swagger of Deathloop. Packed full of charisma and wit, it's a game that can be played your way, with your own style and cunning. A very accomplished package of gameplay features supplies the goods, and the time loop delivers fun and deceitful opportunities over and over again. Deathloop may be the final game out of Arkane Studios to hit Sony consoles, but the developer goes out with an undisputed bang.","We've played the concept of ""eternal return"" in video games for decades, but Deathloop gives it a unique twist and turns it into a central part of its mechanics and plot. Repeating their trusted and tried formula, Arkane Studios improved on it until Deathloop came to be; and while not perfect, it's only a few loops away from it.","Arkane serves a successful evolution of their older concepts, which will entertain with variability, delight with stylization and excite with action. Too bad it is too much guidance and inconsistent artificial intelligence.","Deathloop chooses to keep an ambitious and unique premise playable and that sometimes hinders your mental freedom of movement. However, it manages to keep a game in which repetition is ingrained, entertaining, fascinating and often intense.",Not quite a misfire but while the action is highly entertaining this time-looping adventure squanders much of its premise on disappointingly straightforward objectives and a curiously tame portrayal of unchecked hedonism.,"Comfortable in the exercise of style imposed by the time loop, the artists of Arkane signed with Deathloop a very good FPS that is as interesting as it is wacky. More action-oriented than a Dishonored, Bethesda's title quickly reaches a level of depth but also of complexity that is rare even for a work by Arkane. The repetitive aspect necessarily linked to the theme of the game is intelligently lessened by the variety of situations, the chance of encounters (with Julianna) and the rise in power. Enjoying a concept of loop without running out of time, Deathloop encourages experiments of all kinds in a universe that contrasts drastically with what the people of Lyon have already produced. And it's good to see that the studio doesn't sing us the same song ... over and over.","If there is something lacking in Deathloop, it has to do with emotional staying power. As one egghead, in a scratchy projector film, began to unreel the mythology (“Long ago, the isle of Blackreef experienced a cataclysmic event which tore the fabric of”—and so forth), I realised that I couldn’t care less. Blackreef can go hang. I suspect that the only things that will stick with me—the only things coated with enough Residuum to survive a hard reset—are Colt and Julianna. And maybe that isn’t all bad news. I may replay it at some point, and when I do I’ll be even more like Colt, waking on a beach with the vague prickle of familiarity, and the need to break free.","Deathloop playfully bends the rules of its genre, thanks to being steered by the steady hands of the people who helped write those rules in the first place. Action-stealth games tend toward homogeny, but Deathloop wisely forces you to play smarter — and feel smarter as a result.","There isn't anything else quite like Deathloop. It's a riveting detective mystery, plays with time loops in unique ways, and never feels like it slows down, even in those stealthier moments. It's a game that's thought out top-to-bottom, with two perfect leads heralding the charge and a unique multiplayer component that feels central to everything that Deathloop is, without ever getting in the way. Whether you're looking to break the loop or preserve it, Blackreef is certainly worth the visit. You may find yourself as stuck there too.","Deathloop expertly blends genres for a truly unique experience that delivers on its brilliant premise. Whether you’re sneaking around enemies, battling other players in surprise PvP shoot-outs, solving environmental puzzles, or uncovering clues to solve the mysteries of Blackreef island, it’s almost impossible to avoid Deathloop’s charm.",Deathloop is a promising evolutive step for one of the greatest developers in the industry. Like every attempt to change it has some structural flaws but this inventive FPS/stealth deserves everybody's attention. A fascinating muder puzzle bond to a time loop.,"As most of the former Arkane titles, Deathloop is far away from being a game off the rack. The unique setting with its great artstyle makes it stand out. The fast paced Dishonored-like gameplay is fun as well as if you choose the action or the stealth path. If there weren't some issues concerning balancing or the overall poor AI, Deathloop would be close to a masterpiece. As it is, it's just another great game from Arkane Lyon that's worth to play.",,,,"As Arkane’s been acquired by Xbox, this is its first and last PS5 exclusive. But what better parting gift than a perfect day you could happily live again and again? [Issue#6, p.72]","I liked Deathloop, the hours that I have been with him have been entertaining and in no case has it been repetitive despite having to visit some situations with certain recurrence. However, Arkane has been very conservative in a proposal that I think could have given the player a little more freedom. Well cohesive in its mechanics, it is one point below the rest of the studio's games in the last decade in terms of level design, but it is enough to continue to be above the majority. He fails to be outstanding in almost anything he does, including the invasion mode with Julianna, but still a good title worth enjoying. [Recommended]",,A brilliant timeloop shooter that gives Dishonored's best tricks and techniques more opportunity to shine. [Essential],,"Beneath its stylish mid-century modern decor and abandoned military installation intrigue, however, Deathloop can be a grindy and all too familiar affair. Its constituent parts are mostly excellent, but never cohere into something more than just a good shooter with a clever premise. This doesn’t stop it from being a good game, but it could have been a much more surprising one.","It is the point of convergence for all the stuff you might expect of “a game” in 2021, wrapped in a stylish, meticulously-constructed package.","By the end, I was left in awe at the precision of Deathloop’s focus, the liberty and respect afforded to me as a player, and the minimization — though not complete removal — of frustration in a game entirely centered around repetition. The success with which Arkane pulled this all off is a testament to the studio’s incredible talent and intelligence. No other studio makes you feel quite so smart, and no game of theirs has done it better.",,"Deathloop, summarized, is ""Arkane does Hitman."" It glorifies its repetition, and never feels unrewarding, especially when taking down a player-controlled Juliana. I want to re-immerse myself in its world, pick apart its secrets, and master its systems. Not everything works seamlessly, but taken as a whole it's an immersive sim sandbox of unmatched proportions.","Deathloop is a fantastic game full of surprises. It’s unique design and its brilliant execution offer an adventure that feels fresh and different, and it’s a game that you need to try if you’re looking for something that feels known but new at the same time.","Deathloop takes Arkane’s fantastic level design and world building and adds and interesting story with great characters on top, leaving you in a time loop that you won’t want to break.","Deathloop is the kind of game that will get in your head and stay there even when you’re not playing. Colt is a great protagonist, the intricate environmental design is a dream to explore, and the loop system keeps things fresh and offers so much replayability. Simply put, Deathloop is fantastic.","Deathloop is for detective nerds who just want to blow shit up. Each moment of this game offers some insane new plot twists and discoveries that further highlights how amazing the writing is. Players are rewarded through exploration, but at the cost that they could lose it all if they die in the process. It's an experience that demands a keen eye and patience at times to unlock everything it has to offer, but at least the dumb enemies will rarely get in your way.","Deathloop offers well-designed stealth levels under the core gameplay of Roguelike. At the same time, the variety of weapons and special powers also support the exciting combat. Julianna's ""invasion"" adds the uncertainty of the game, but may also spoil the player's experience.","A concept that originally seems daunting, once you get into the central mechanic of Deathloop, it all makes sense. Be prepared to die again and again, remapping the same perpetual day out in a variety of different ways to hunt your targets. Arkane have refined their craft once more, delivering a densely packed world with so, so much to do. And as always, an insane variety in how to kill and look good doing it.","If your prefer your time-looping adventures to be more stylish and violence-oriented, then Deathloop may be for you. Even with its various issues, there is satisfaction to be had in learning each map and completing the perfect series of assassinations.","It seems that repetition is winning the day, so if at first you don't succeed try try again. The complexities and permutations in Deathloop are initially overwhelming and confusing, the intro attempts to explain so much by way of plot, mechanics and characterisation in a very short space of time. However, work past this point and the fun begins, with a sense of exploration and an arsenal of weapons and attacks making combat feel very rewarding. The story, despite at times being told through messages and text is well voiced acted, despite the incessant need to swear. Pulling off stealth kills or killing one of the eight main characters after figuring out how to infiltrate their plans makes players feel they have outwitted their computer counterpart. If there was one title to buy on PlayStation 5 right now that is truly next gen, then make sure Deathloop is at the top of that list.","An awesome story, nice gameplay, beautiful characters and a lot of freedom. Deathloop is something really unique and special, a game that we will play again and again in an infinite loop.","Deathloop is an original, visionary and courageous work, a playful experiment that returns to reaffirm the unquestionable talent of the Arkane Studios team, which over the years has never stopped putting itself to the test with ever new challenges, often at odds with the commercial logic of the triple A market. The result of the studio's latest creative challenge is a brilliant exercise in game design, at the base of a multifaceted and compelling playful narrative construct, blessed with an absolutely majestic artistic direction. Deathloop is a unique game of its kind, which unfortunately is torn from excellence by some rather important flaws. First of all, a surprisingly lazy and anticlimatic conclusion, which ends up revealing some evident gaps in the script. Even on the playful side, not everything works perfectly, especially due to an artificial intelligence that is not very reactive and too erratic. Net of its missteps, however, Deathloop remains a memorable work, a jumble of style and creativity probably destined to become an instant cult.","Deathloop is based on Dishonored foundations and uses many of its level design tropes. It must be considered a smaller project, but a very brilliant one, with very good ideas and an intriguing game concept.",,,"Deathloop is a game that will be talked about for a long time and one that will undoubtedly be in the running for Game of the Year 2021. Its well-crafted systems, gripping narrative threads and quasi-choose your own adventure style gameplay make it the best Next-Gen title so far.",,"Deathloop is another hit from the talented Arkane Studios, albeit with some noticeable shortcomings. It’s especially peculiar that the A.I. is -simply put- bad, considering that Prey and especially Dishonored 2 where some of the highest quality games in this aspect. Nevertheless, the loop system where we live the same day again and again is cleverly implemented and utilized leading to an unforgettable and unique experience.","Deathloop is one of the most innovative games from a major publisher that I’ve ever played, using the time loop mechanic to fantastic effect. With lots of clever puzzles and engaging combat, as well as a genius multiplayer element, this is one of the best games of 2021 yet.",,"Taken as a single-player experience, Deathloop feels complete and incredibly well-rounded. The extra injection of optional multiplayer action is a fabulous cherry on top. Basically, Deathloop is everything I wanted it to be. It’s confident both as a successor to many of the ideas of Dishonored while also expressly its own thing, with a tone and sense of style I absolutely adore. It’s one of my favourite games of the year - and one we’ll surely be talking about for months to come.",,Deathloop encases fun investigation work and satisfying combat in a unique time loop mechanic to create a tremendously satisfying adventure.,,,"Deathloop is both unique and familiar, subverting time, gameplay and expectations in equal measure. A mystery worth solving and experience worth having, there is nothing on this planet quite like Deathloop.",,,"Deathloop is still signature Arkane in terms of exemplary immersive-sim design, reminiscent of BioShock and Dishonored, but it also puts a giant smile on your face each and every time you play.","Once Deathloop steps back and lets you explore Blackreef in your own way, you’re presented with an expertly crafted world that changes as you poke and prod away at it. By doubling down on a handful of mechanics, Deathloop is a much sleeker, much more immediate experience than other Arkane games. I’d struggle to pick out a sub-par moment, or a target that was anything less than iconic. I feel that with Deathloop, one of the world’s best studios has put its best foot forward, offering up a painstakingly curated selection of reasons why it simply does it better than most. Deathloop is the most compelling reason to buy a PS5 yet, and a game that is destined to be referenced by future titles for years to come.",,"Deathloop layers a refined take on Arkane’s signature mix of ability-driven action and stealth onto a time-looping premise, and the result is one of most memorable games of recent years.

Deathloop is a deep and greatly fun immersive sim in disguise, with strong characters, an interesting narrative and a beautifully handcrafted creative gameplay. Blackreef is a wonderful playground where freedom really matters and where amazing happens.",,"Deathloop is a bloody, chaotic mess. A mess you will fail at over and over until finally, you succeed. And that success – the result of hours of experimentation, iteration, and knowledge – makes for one of the best games of the year.",,,"DEATHLOOP won't be a game for everyone—however, if you are a fan of sandbox styled titles or if you just like games like Dishonored, DEATHLOOP is a familiar feeling experience presented in a unique way that makes it feel fresh and fun to play.","Deathloop is an unusual but fascinating game to be experienced in one breath as a superb noir thriller in which, however, we are the killer. The AI is out of place compared to the rest of the game and it's not a perfect game, but it's not afraid to dare, it has style in spades, shows the creative team’s burning passion in every corner and when finally get that perfect loop, the satisfaction is immeasurable.",,,"If you've been waiting for the PlayStation 5's first true killer app, this is it. Deathloop is an innovative and satisfying take on the shooter genre that you can't afford to miss. Developer Arkane Studios has managed to take Dishonored's rock-solid foundation and hone it to a razor's edge. With a rewarding progression system and a gameplay loop that encourages experimentation and exploration, you can't help but wonder why Colt would ever want to break this cycle. Sprawling, cerebral, and consistently exciting, Deathloop deserves a spot in every shooter fan's PS5 library.",Deathloop offers up a highly enjoyable gameplay loop shrouded in mystery.,"Arkane Studios latest shooter grabs you directly with it's mix of smart gameplay and mysterious storytelling. While the time loop concept is engaging, it's the freedom of mixing between various gameplay styles that makes Deathloop more addicting than other games in the same genre. Although it can get a little tedious with the large amount of intel that is dropped simultaneous from time to time.","Deathloop is not only this year, but one of the most original and different productions we have come across recently. It is really enjoyable to see the map in different ways at different times of the day and to try to complete this big puzzle with the clues you find.","Deathloop is a well-crafted, intelligent murder puzzle worth solving, regardless of your experience with immersive sims or roguelikes. There are a few bugs at launch though.","A rich and diversified gameplay is at the heart of Deathloop, the like Arkane is known for, but the studio, or Bethesda is too shy of letting the player explore by himself et ruin the pleasure of exploration. Also, the invasion mechanism is a little too... invasive.","Deathloop absolutely has its issues, but none of them ultimately get in the way of the experience the game is trying to provide. There is so much delicious freedom available that you really feel as though you get to form your own identity in the game. It's a point that's made abundantly clear as you study the various playstyles of the people who invade you as well as the ones you invade. Arkane has built a reputation on making smart games that play as well as they're designed, and Deathloop is only further evidence of that fact.","Deathloop’s mind-bending time mechanic, captivating art style, open-ended gameplay, and colorful cast of characters create a captivating shooter experience that you shouldn’t miss.","Mixing stealth, weighty gunplay, supernatural powers, and play-your-way weapons and gadgets, Deathloop is a greatest-hits amalgam of Arkane style with a splash of grindhouse grittiness and a satisfying murder puzzle narrative to put it apart from anything that has come before.",Deathloop takes Arkane's well known brand of first-person action stealth and artfully melds it into a time-bending multi-assassination power fantasy.,Deathloop is a game where observation and dynamic thinking go hand-in-hand with shotgunning goons in the face and snapping their necks ... it delivers bombastic thrills and wince-inducing kills with intelligence and elegance in equal measure.,"Saying Deathloop plays with the form isn’t mere hyperbole. In much the same way great films defy comparison, or push their respective artform forward, Deathloop does so for the first-person shooter. By pairing the idea of ‘where to go’ and ‘how to approach’ with that of a deep underlying mystery, Deathloop is as dense a puzzle to solve as it is a combat playground to conquer.","Deathloop is my biggest surprise of the year. While it might be expected that Arkane would craft another high-quality experience, I'm personally astonished by how much the studio's latest release has clicked with me. Even though it might have a lot of common DNA with what Arkane has done before, the sheer amount of style and inventiveness that can be found in Deathloop makes it stand out greatly in a crowded video game market. If you're looking for something completely different compared to everything else that has released this year, Deathloop is absolutely worth getting lost in.","Deathloop is probably one of the best examples of really blending those rogue-lite elements into an otherworldly and excellent story, freedom of choice, tight controls and a delightful cast of characters all wrapped in a beautiful package.","Deathloop takes elements from games like Bioshock and Dishonored, combining them with a Groundhogs Day like timeloop to create the coolest, most stylish, and best game of the year.",,"Deathloop feels like the end result of an experiment that Arkane started with the release of Prey: Mooncrash. In many ways, it has successfully nurtured that genius nugget of an idea — a roguelike immersive simulator — into a AAA blockbuster. I am once again blown away by Arkane’s ambitions in game design, and how they manage to maintain them alongside such strong aesthetics, and compelling writing. This is an essential purchase if you value video games that expand the medium’s boundaries.","Deathloop is a tremendously stylish stealth-action game that builds on Arkane's strengths, even if some of its creative gambles fall flat.","Deathloop is a rare game, ripped straight from Arkane’s rulebook, infused so deeply with its DNA, but still something entirely its own, separate to what the studio has made before. It feels like big-budget production and indie ideas merged together and I hope it gives Arkane the mainstream break it deserves.",,"Given the sheer amount of self-plagiarism on display here, it’s impossible not to wonder how a more traditional, Dishonored-style level structure could have benefited this world and power-set, allowing these characters, and that intoxicatingly addictive multiplayer, to get more of the focus. And that’s the core paradox of Deathloop, the worst game in recent memory from a studio so good at what it does that it’ll still inevitably land on our Game Of The Year list when December rolls around. It’s a great game in spite of itself, and its titular selling point; the loop might be broken, but Arkane’s grasp of its core mechanics remains solid as ever.","The most remarkable thing about Deathloop is how all of its elements — the intricate, stylish world of Blackreef; action that encourages experimentation; a mystery dense with ideas and surprises; the entertainingly hostile relationship between Colt and Julianna — fit together so seamlessly. You could spend the morning tip-toeing around guards to find a password hidden in a desk, which helps you steal a sniper rifle in the afternoon, which you then use to take down a boss in the evening. And right after, Julianna is going to call you on a walkie for a charmingly expletive-laced tirade. Each of those elements feels not only cohesive, but necessary. In most games, audiologs are throwaway lore meant for the most hardcore fans. Here they can be the difference between success and failure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Deathloop is in a weird spot. It isn't as good as Dishonored, but I also don't expect to see another game in the series. If you want to support the studio or need a Dishonored fix, this will help...but honestly, the game isn't that fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
horizon-forbidden-west,The game is devoted above all else to making the player believe that its world is worth saving and that its people are worth knowing.,,"Horizon Forbidden West is, above all, more Horizon. And, I would say, more refined in many ways, but still with the fundamental elements of its predecessor. And that's a good thing. The world full of secrets with many things to explore and more secrets to discover. The Forbidden West is big and wild, but finding out more about it, its people, and its past is quite rewarding.","It's in the great outdoors where Forbidden West comes to life - which is ironic given how often we're told it's dying. When the story's leash is off and we're free to luxuriate in its world and the wider cast's personal tales (one sidequest, involving a missing friend and an unrequited romance, is an exemplar of the form), it's not hard to understand why the first game was so popular. This is, then, more of the same in every sense, and your feelings towards the first will determine whether you see that as a recommendation. [Issue#369, p.100]",,"Horizon Forbidden West is an excellent game. The possibilities are numerous and the game goes much further than its predecessor with its beautiful moments of discovery and contemplation. The still nervous gameplay offers a multitude of aspects for extremely interesting clashes. Visually, the Guerilla’s title is sumptuous, aside from some technical problems and its generosity makes it an incredible experience. If the narrative is not perfect, the story follows with pleasure.","Forbidden West is a worthy sequel to the Horizon: Zero Down and builds up on an already solid action adventure and improves it in almost every possible way. The platforming gameplay could have been a bit deeper and the core story still offers nothing fresh, but nevertheless Forbidden West is definitely one of the best action adventures in recent years and one of the contenders for game of the year title.",,"This game is just incredible. Amazing locals, great story, insane graphics and wonderful gameplay make this a must play on a PS5 or a PS4. It's really just shy of greatness, as fans of the first game will find themselves enamored by this new entry.","If you loved the original, grab this sequel that is superior in almost every aspect. Graphics, audio, story and overall narrative as well as amazing location variety are this game’s strongest points. The presence of clunky combat, controls and a number of bugs will make it harder for newcomers to experience Horizon Forbidden West. Yet what can’t be denied is the fact it’s not an „everyday title“, and as such is not for everyone.","The example of difficult second album syndrome that most readily came to mind while I wandered these wastelands is the Stone Roses, who spent almost five years trying to outdo their era-defining, genre-defying debut only to emerge with a bloated classic rock retread that effectively ended the band’s career. That’s not to say Horizon Forbidden West is gaming’s ‘Second Coming’ – but it’s not the second coming of gaming either.",,"Horizon Forbidden West not only furthers the narrative of one of PlayStation's most recognisable icons, but also manages to reassure PlayStation gamers of the rude health of PlayStation Studios sterling reputation for creating stunning first-party, single-player adventures. In every way that it can be, Horizon Forbidden West is Horizon Zero Dawn 2.0 and while I might crave some more variety in its open-world activities, Guerrilla Games has nonetheless crafted a triumphant sequel that earns its place among the very best that PlayStation Studios has to offer.","Horizon Forbidden West is a true next-gen experience and one of the best games available on the PS5 right now. With breath-taking graphics and fantastic character work, Guerrilla Games has raised the bar for open-world action adventure games. It's not perfect, but you can't help but want to play more.","The Forbidden West takes Horizon to the next level. A massive open-world with a lot to do, incredible gameplay and very memorable characters.",Horizon Forbidden West surpasses the first title in the saga with a sequel that surprises in its history and improves all aspects of its predecessor.,"Do you know that indefinable feeling that you have to like something? That everyone in the amusement park is having a great time, but your mind is elsewhere? That's what we experienced when we played Horizon: Forbidden West, the long-awaited new hit for Playstation. Yes, it's very well put together. Yes, it looks stunning. And yes, the battles are wildly exciting. Yet we feel something niggling. Is it the magic of that first encounter that has disappeared?",Horizon Forbidden West is one of the great games this year. The sequel created by Guerrilla Games is more and better than the one we experienced with Aloy in 2017. A must for those who played the original and a great find for those looking to embark on a grand journey alongside an unforgettable heroine.,,You may have played its various parts before in multiple other games but the makers have taken the best of the rest and forged their own unique hit with a pitch-perfect story and exemplary gameplay.,"Building on all of Zero Dawn's impressive achievements, Horizon Forbidden West feels like a natural evolution of the formula, featuring a sophisticated combat system, impressive variety of enemies, hundreds of activities to do, a gripping story that shines through its lore and characters, visual section of true next generation and a world much more explorable and free than that of its predecessor, which due to certain design compromises, perhaps makes the exploration more systematic than we would have liked. In any case, Guerrilla Games is delivering a game that lives up to the enormous expectations that were held and, therefore, a clear candidate to become Game of the Year.","So all-in-all, Horizon Forbidden West is a very satisfying, extremely impressive if somewhat predictable sequel, to one of the best original titles of last generation. It’s a showcase for the PS5 platform (and not exactly a slouch on the original PS4 and PS4 Pro amazingly), and definitely worth the price of admission.","Horizon Forbidden West is a step above its fellow open world games because it goes out of its way to ensure that everything is worth doing, not just the main story. It's more of the same from Zero Dawn in a lot of ways, but with significant improvements across the board to create a generally superior experience. And while Guerrilla said that Horizon Forbidden West isn't being held back by being a cross-gen game, it will be exciting to see what the studio can do when building a Horizon adventure from the ground-up for PS5. In the meantime, Horizon Forbidden West is another must-play PlayStation exclusive.","Horizon: Forbidden West is a must-play game, no question about it. But for those looking for the same awe Zero Dawn instilled, expectations may need to be tempered. Conversations will almost assuredly be had over the next few months in regards to where the franchise is headed, and I’m excited to be having those conversations. But for now, we can all sit back and enjoy the Forbidden West.","People are going to play this game and have a lot of fun. That’s all a lot of people want from a game, and Forbidding West delivers. Through a certain lens, it deserves the perfect scores I’m expecting to see. But much like Ghost of Tsushima, a lot of you are going to come away disappointed by the lack of substance and new ideas. In many ways, Horizon Forbidden West is like it’s own machines. It’s grand, it’s gorgeous, but it has no soul.","Horizon Forbidden West is a tweaked, enhanced, and confident sequel that exceeds expectations, delivering an open world full of compelling characters, an intriguing story, and yes, more super awesome robot dinosaurs.","I have deep and irresolvable issues with Horizon: Forbidden West, and it largely boils down to the game being an empty blockbuster that will chew up a lot of your time, but not do anything meaningful with it. However, that's all Horizon ever wanted to be and criticising Horizon for not being a great work of art is like criticising a reality television dance show for not being ballet. For what it is, Horizon is impeccable. Most importantly, it builds on the success of the first game in a way that I am quite certain that those who loved Aloy and her first quest will find even more to love about this one.",Horizon: Forbidden West is a lock-the-doors sci-fi epic packed to the brim with fascinating characters and countless pleasures that will take players many hours to completely devour.,"Horizon: Forbidden West builds on the solid foundations of Zero Dawn and does not only expand them, but stabilizes them by fixing a number of unnecessary shortcomings of the first game. Fixing some annoying mechanics, reworking combat, exploring and side quests are some of the positive changes that will be appreciated especially by players who have found the open world of Zero Dawn boring.","If you’re willing to take your time and explore through the ruins of a fallen society, where every other corner is teeming with machines that you’ll need to be at the top of your game to destroy, then Horizon Forbidden West is an incredible game and a world that we wanted to return to many hours after the credits rolled.","Is a game always better if it has more content than its previous entry? In this specific case, I have to say no. Horizon Forbidden West still is a great game, there is no doubt whatsoever about that, but it did not manage to go to the next level. If you enjoyed the first entry of the series you are probably going to enjoy this one all the same, maybe even more. However, I feel a lack of ambition, mainly because I wholeheartedly believe that both Aloy and Guerrilla are capable of something 'bigger'.","Once again I was enamored by this unique, fascinating world and Guerrilla’s whole vision of Earth after the fall of our civilization. In terms of gameplay Horizon Forbidden West is not a revolution, but rather a natural evolution that introduces many improvements. You can think of it as a supercharged Horizon Zero Dawn – bigger, more beautiful and richer in content. It’s not a perfect game, as the human enemy AI needs a major overhaul and there are some technical issues to sort out, but it’s a thrilling, memorable adventure.",,"Guerilla Games has a great handle on the open world genre at this point, and knows how to cater to people who do like certain broader comfort food elements without going overboard.","Aside from some very minor bugs, Forbidden West was a treat to play and is an early contender for Game of the Year. Aloy’s journey across the West is a must-play for PlayStation owners and another reminder that Sony’s first-party studios are at the cutting edge of gaming.",Horizon Forbidden West is one of the best open world games from the last couple of years. Whether you a fan of the original title or just love yourself a grand adventure — Forbidden West is something you would really enjoy.,"Horizon Forbidden West fails to live up to its predecessor in just about every way. While the world and its many new machines are stunning, the experience is bogged down with confusing design choices and variation for the sake of variation - making Aloy's newest adventure one to forget.","Anyone who digs these kinds of dense, map-based open world experiences is going to feel happy with what Guerrilla Games is offering here.",Horizon Forbidden West pulls players along on a breathtaking journey – one so lifelike and human it’s almost unbelievable just how good it really is.,"Bigger and better than its predecessor in every single way, Horizon Forbidden West is a game that’s ever so easy to get lost in. It’s got a surprisingly heart-warming story in which Aloy finally realises the value of friendship, thrilling combat that never loses its edge, and a dense world that’s not only cram-packed with things to do, but is also utterly gorgeous. It’s yet another must-have first-party title for PlayStation gamers. And on PS5 with its lightning-fast loading times, stunning visuals and brilliant DualSense implementation, it’s a real showcase of what the hardware can do.",Horizon Zero Dawn was one of the best games of the last console generation. I'm not sure I see any reason why Horizon Forbidden West won't go down as one of the best of this generation.,"Horizon Forbidden West is a clear step up from the first game. With the addition of new biomes, extra tools, an extremely compelling story, and a ton of content to keep you busy, this is another single-player action-adventure hit for PlayStation. It’s amazingly fun to play, consistently incredible to look at, and even while writing these words, all I’ve wanted to do is jump back into the Forbidden West.","Horizon Forbidden West is a masterpiece. With a gripping story and a world ripe for exploration, you won't be disappointed.","I don’t think I’ve seen half of what Forbidden West has to offer. It bored me sometimes with endless dialogue and exposition, but is equally generous with things to do and places to explore and creatures to unwisely provoke. Unlike many open-world games it is continually offering you something new, and a couple of the tools you acquire later in the game really open the whole place up. It’s got the spirit of a Metroid or Tomb Raider-style puzzle adventure on the scale of an Assassin’s Creed. And once again: by god, it is beautiful. I’ll happily endure ten minutes of being lectured about terraforming, in exchange for marvelling at these sunken caves, forbidding plains and mechanical T-rexes.","Bottom line, Guerrilla has delivered a masterpiece that stands large with the best open-world games we've ever seen. A masterful story full of twists and turns takes you through an unparalleled world of stunning beauty. The Forbidden West is alive and invites you to enjoy dozens of hours of action, adventure, and phenomenal environments.","At times Horizon II is an epic game, with an impeccable art style and great technical section. As befits a sequel, it multiplies all the possibilities of the original, but this makes the secondary, missions or the progress system less inspired, and slows down the pace of the game. We have found some bugs.","So while Horizon Forbidden West isn’t changing the rules of the genre, it’s an excellently crafted, entertaining, and satisfying adventure. It looks phenomenal and offers a sandbox of gameplay that remains just as unique as the original. Is it more of the same? In a way, I suppose. But I know I wouldn’t say no to more of Horizon Zero Dawn as it was 5 years ago, and Forbidden West is an improvement in nearly every way.","Horizon Forbidden West is the perfect evolution of the saga. It doesn't add many pieces to its gear, but the ones it does add are so subtle that they enhance the experience considerably. Guerrilla has built a world in which it is a pleasure to get lost thanks to its infinite possibilities. A universe that has its own personality and that comes for an Aloy that is even more courageous and dedicated to become a complete inspiration.","Horizon: Forbidden West is an enjoyable game from start to finish which easily allows you to become lost in its virtual mythology. The gameplay, sound and graphics work hand-in-hand to create an engaging PS5 title. It’s also well-written and directed by the developers with fantastic voice acting and a soundtrack that sounds it has been taken from a Hollywood blockbuster which makes this game a masterpiece on the PlayStation 5 and a must play game… no, masterpiece of 2022.","Horizon Forbidden West is a masterpiece. The foundation that Horizon Zero Dawn has laid is improved in every way, whether it's gameplay or story. We have amazing graphics, charismatic characters, an intriguing plot and an addictive, varied and challenging gameplay.","Horizon Forbidden West deepens the existing mechanics and expands them, without major innovations, but enough to satisfy us. The narrative, whether on a small scale, with regional conflicts between tribes, or on a large scale, with connections between the distant past and the cursed present, makes us want to play incessantly, until we finish and discover everything. The mysteries and revelations about the story on a large scale are even the high point of the game. This is a measured step towards the future of the series, but a sure step that retains much of what worked in Zero Dawn (and occasionally some of the original game's problems), without being too daring and delivering less than expected.",,"Horizon Forbidden West doesn't try to reinvent the genre, and it's barely an evolution either. The developers have simply mixed all the current ingredients in perfect proportions. What they did in the end was throttling the freedom, gradually revealing the full extent of the experience in Forbidden West. One of the finest adventures we've recently had for sure!","It’s not just that Horizon Forbidden West is bigger, it’s better. Guerrilla had already crafted an incredible title in Zero Dawn, but they’ve graduated into building an immaculate one in Forbidden West. Its strengths are taken to new heights, tuned to being the best they can be, and what were once weaknesses transform into pillars the series can build on. Besides a few minor technical issues, Horizon Forbidden West is the perfect example of what you want a sequel to an already great game to be, and it’s certainly a challenger for best game in 2022.","Overall, some minor technical nagging is the only thing that really holds back Horizon: Forbidden West back. It has a delightful protagonist, an engaging story, a wonderful setting, fun combat and exploration, and lovely visuals. I enjoyed just about every moment I spent with the game. If you were a fan of the original, then the sequel delivers on everything that it promises. Newcomers will likely want to finish Zero Dawn first, but as long as the idea of hunting robot dinosaurs with a bow and arrow sounds good, then two of the finest open-world games await you.","More beautiful, smoother, better written, phenomenal art design, a consistent story, more surprises and better main and side missions: Horizon Forbidden West is better than Horizon Zero Dawn on almost every front.","Horizon Forbidden West is a textbook sequel, but a really well-executed one. You already know what you are going to find and it does not seek to reinvent the wheel or modify the formula that led the first game to sell more than 20 million units. Guerrilla Games therefore opted to take the very good base already established in Zero Dawn and worked to improve the combat, the options to navigate the map, the story, its characters, its mythology, climates and setting, all wrapped up in a dazzling visual package that It's nice to explore at all times.","Horizon Forbidden West is an exceedingly clever sequel, a deep and addictive action RPG, a dense world that unfolds with an impeccable sense of pace, a visual tour de force and the masterful delivery of a promising concept. Somehow, by some sheer creative force a big, blockbuster open world game about post-apocalyptic tribal warriors with AR headsets fighting robot dinosaurs works even better the second time around. If you have access to a PlayStation you owe it to yourself to play this right away.","Horizon Forbidden West is a delightful follow-up to Zero Dawn with drastically improved graphics and new additions to the gameplay mechanics. While the gameplay can get a bit repetitive and the story doesn’t hit quite as hard as the first game’s, it is an enjoyable romp through a wasteland teeming with machines.","A consistent sequel that surpasses the first part in terms of gameplay, but falls short in terms of story.","Aloy's journey through the Forbidden West is a grand one complete with awe-inspiring environments as you take down new machines with an expanded arsenal. Although the story is lacking the personal touch of the first game, if you're looking for an action-filled adventure with thoroughly enjoyable gameplay then you certainly can't go wrong with Horizon Forbidden West.","Horizon Forbidden West is exactly what everyone thought it would be: an amazing game. It has an open world with plenty of things to do and places to explore, fights against some really well-developed machines and stunning visuals. The feeling is that the second game of the series improves on what was already great, and it feels rewarding and fun to play. It is another single-player masterpiece from Sony.","Simply put, this one is special.",,"Horizon Forbidden West vastly improves the formula that Guerruilla created a few years ago. The open world is vivid and very immersive, helped by gorgeous visuals. The rock climbing system could be a little more open and give us a bit more freedom though.","Horizon Forbidden West is a treasure trove of exploration and has everything the first one had but further expands and improves on it to give fans a more robust experience. Slight tweaks to combat make it more varied, dungeons feature even more puzzles to solve, and its riveting story keeps you hooked until the end. Its somewhat of a cliffhanger ending will leave fans wanting more, but suffice it to say, this is a must-play for any PS5 owner.","Aloy's new adventure features a beautiful open world that invites immediate exploration. The many missions and side quests make it a delightful experience, thanks in part to the variety of enemies. In addition, the story is very compelling, but we can't ignore the fact that the game is not yet completely polished after the day one patch. There are many bugs and technical issues that can be annoying and that is a shame, but there is no doubt that the adventure in itself is more than worth it.","The overriding question Horizon Forbidden West left me with is ‘when will its prospective audience grow tired of the tired conventions that underwrite so many go-and-save-the-world adventure games?’ As much as I appreciated the fun that came from smashing up robots, Horizon Forbidden West won’t earn a spot in my long-term memory.","Overall, Horizon Forbidden West is a huge improvement on its predecessor. The map is diverse and full of stunning sights; characters and conversations are so much better; and the already great gameplay is enhanced with new weapons, more options, and better melee. The story doesn't have quite the same element of surprise as the first game, but it still builds upon things with some daring twists of its own. Any minor quibbles we have melt away when the game's firing on all cylinders. It's a gorgeous, wildly fun action RPG, and there's nothing else quite like it.","Horizon Forbidden West shows how humanity is its own worst enemy while following the story set up in the first game. It has great game mechanics, which will keep you playing every single mission in the game.","Forbidden West is consistent if not revolutionary, conservative but also precise, self-confident, sweeping, and personal. And oftentimes it simply takes your breath away.","A gigantic time-guzzler that combines a lot of elements of the best open world games, from Assassin's Creed to The Witcher and from Far Cry to Red Dead Redemption; Horizon Forbidden West wants it all. Due to this enormous ambition, this has unfortunately become a less perfect and more overwhelming game than predecessor Zero Dawn, but certainly no less unforgettable.","A solid sequel to the crowd-pleasing original, which still doesn’t make enough of its unique setting but manages to add an impressive amount of depth to its combat and side content.","Building on an already very good first episode, Horizon Forbidden West hits the stars, becoming a true culmination for the Guerrilla Games studio formula but also for the “classic” open world genre in general. Fascinating from start to finish, with a universe with sumptuous artistic direction, better written and directed, and more engaging from the point of view of combat and exploration, the title is almost irreproachable on everything that he undertakes, showing attention to detail at every moment. In addition, Horizon Forbidden West even has the luxury of being both excellent on PS5, PS4 Pro but also PS4 Fat, thanks to exemplary cross-generation work. We can only regret a final conclusion that was a little quickly dispatched, and a lack of major new features. Not enough to spoil the wonderful adventure that awaits in the prohibited West. A truly exceptional title.",,"Horizon Forbidden West is the latest in Sony’s prestigious run of polished first-person exclusives. As the sequel to 2017’s acclaimed Horizon Zero Dawn, the bar is set high for Aloy’s next adventure. The first game debuted in an era before exclusives like God of War, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, and The Last of Us Part II broke barriers in gameplay accessibility. In 2022, Forbidden West has a much higher standard to meet, and for the most part, it’s a resounding success.","But while some of these visual issues are still waiting to be rectified with an update, Horizon Forbidden West improves on Zero Dawn in so many different ways. The story and combat remain high points for the series, with the latter getting even better with increased diversity of machines and looting providing another complex layer to think about. Side quests have improved and there are new side activities to suit all types of players. Added to all this, the world of the Forbidden West remains beautiful despite its hostility and it’s been a long time since I’ve lost hours in a game without once getting bored. Those who enjoyed Aloy’s previous adventures should definitely consider adding this one to the collection.","If you loved Horizon Zero Dawn, you’ll no doubt love Forbidden West as well. It’s a glorious sequel that improves on the foundations laid by the original in pretty much every way, with an unbelievable amount of content to discover and some of the best visuals I’ve ever seen. It’s a must-play for PS5 owners looking to get the most out of their console.","More robotic creatures, a wider map, underwater missions and better graphics: Forbidden West is bigger and badder than Zero Dawn. Still, after five years the combat system is less appealing and the quality of life is no longer up to the standards. Guerrilla Games could have dared more, but the result is, anyway, worth your attention.","Horizon Forbidden West simply surpasses its predecessor in every aspect. The well-directed story is as motivating as the complex systems for skills, weapons, and other equipment. The thrilling (boss) fights provide a great mixture of action and tactics. And if you take a deeper look at the graphics you'll feel the slobber running down your chin – even on PS4.","Horizon Forbidden West is a sequel that mostly relies on its great roots to hold itself up. It's bigger, has an enjoyable main story and thrilling combat, and adds a few new branches - brittle as they may be. It looks and sounds great, and some minor technical issues aside, is an adventure that's worth experiencing.","Horizon 2 : Forbidden West outperforms its predecessor at all levels. Melee combat system is deeper, Aloy is more charismatic, every machine is more detailed, and players can enjoy several hundreds hours of content. The game is an undeniable success.","Horizon Forbidden West is Guerrilla's best game to date, taking Aloy to new heights with a blockbuster release that meets the high standards set by PlayStation in recent years. While it's totally worth fans jumping in on day one, it's perhaps better to wait a few weeks until all the bugs are ironed out.","If you loved Zero Dawn, you’ll love this. But even though it sands down its predecessor’s rough edges, we’re left uncertain about the future of the series. [Issue#12, p.64]","I thought Horizon: Forbidden West would be a worthy sequel that would expand on the outline of its first part, but this game does some very special and to some extent revolutionary things. [Recommended]","But if you forced me to pick only one February game to recommend, I'd point to H:FW as the month's best testament to how beautiful, thrilling, and emotional video games can be. It also gets bonus points on the recommendation matrix for its healthy accessibility sliders, which, among other things, let anyone downgrade the combat to either ""simple"" or ""cakewalk"" difficulty levels. I still think H:FW is more fun with difficulty cranked up, so that players can't stupidly melee their way through some of gaming's most thrilling herd combat. But that's your choice to make, not mine. [ARS Technica Approved]","While it's undoubtedly another accomplished game in terms of technical achievement and sheer visual spectacle - I'm reminded again of those incredible faces, and one particularly outstanding underwater level - I've enjoyed Forbidden West less than Zero Dawn. The main story has major issues, and the level design made it difficult for me to play the way I had previously enjoyed, while making a lot of the newer systems feel redundant. Beyond that, the sense is of a game where Guerrilla has cobbled together RPG building blocks often without making them work within the context of its own game, and in some cases actively worsening Horizon Forbidden West as a result. I don't expect groundbreaking innovation, but with using well-established elements there's always the danger of them having been done better elsewhere. Unfortunately, with Horizon Forbidden West that's often the case.","Undoubtedly a gorgeous spectacle in every way, Forbidden West struggles to develop a compelling storyline out of the gate. It mitigates that through a satisfying and customizable combat system, though in our playthrough so far, hasn't demonstrated a substantial evolution from the original. [Quick Look]","I thoroughly enjoyed Horizon Forbidden West, and I suspect anyone who loves open-world RPGs will thoroughly enjoy it as well. But despite getting a kick out of fighting robot dinos, despite the enthralling time sink of “Machine Strike,” despite finding myself ravenous to return to this rich, inspired open world, I can’t shake how plainly Forbidden West misses the one philosophical throughline that helped its predecessor ascend to greatness: Sometimes, the question is more interesting than the answer.","Horizon Zero Dawn set a high bar in 2017. I can definitively say after rolling credits on Forbidden West that it not only meets that bar, it parkours over it and soars off on a robo-bird into the sunset.","In the end, this is Aloy’s story: She continues to be a headstrong protagonist, and I say that admiringly. In Forbidden West, she takes no sh*t — but she also learns valuable lessons about accepting help, and about acknowledging the grief that comes from growing up as an outcast. She goes to bat for the people she cares about. Forbidden West homes in on the contrast between her convictions and those of Dr. Elisabet Sobeck, the creator of the Zero Dawn project that set the whole series in motion, and the character from whom Aloy was cloned. Where Sobeck took the destruction of humanity as an assumption, and worked to repopulate the Earth, Aloy fights for the survival of those who are alive today. Even as the story throws in twists and additional characters that alter the scope of the threat she’s up against, her steadfast resolve remains. Getting to play as her — in such a beautiful and densely packed world — is a journey I won’t walk away from anytime soon.","Horizon Forbidden West is a great sequel that builds upon and expands what made the original so beloved, and though it takes some steps back in terms of certain mechanics and polish, it’s still a thrilling ride from start to finish.",,Forbidden West is an exemplary sequel that takes the series to new heights and delivers one of the best open world games to date.,"Horizon Forbidden West is a bigger, better game than the original in nearly every way. With tons of engaging side content, a wide array of beautiful biomes to explore, and multiple threatening new machines to take on, there’s a lot to see and do in the Forbidden West.","Horizon Forbidden West improves upon Zero Dawn in almost every aspect. The story is particularly well-written and ebbs and flows from air punching highs to dark, horrific lows. Like later Jurassic Park movies it suffers from the fact that we've already seen massive robotic dinosaurs on our TVs, the wow factor is reduced, and that the puzzles, crafting, and RPG elements could have been lifted from any number of games. Even so, it's still a spectacular robo-beast smack down and thoroughly enjoyable to play.",,"In addition to ensuring a solid storyline and combat performance, Horizon Forbidden West also makes a lot of attempts in the application of new technologies and deserves to be evaluated as a work full of the spirit of exploration. However, from the perspective of gameplay, for Horizon Forbidden West, it is a bit unsatisfactory in the control of the pace of gameplay and the content enrichment of the open world.",,"Horizon Forbidden West's captivating story, gorgeous open world, and thrilling combat make for one of the most uniquely memorable games I've played in recent memory.",,"A wonderful sequel focuses entirely on world building and the quality of its (side and main) missions. Everything is bigger and better, making us forget its undeniable similarities to a lot of past open world games. He's not as bold as he could have been, but he hits the mark perfectly!","As Zero Dawn's natural evolution, Horizon Forbidden West accomplishes what a sequel should achieve: reaching new heights. Guerrilla Games builds a great world, perfecting every aspect of the first episode.","Aloy's new journey is one to remember: the Forbidden West is a living, captivating and fascinating world, and everything you loved about Zero Dawn is back in a bigger, better and deeper way, in one of the best open worlds by PlayStation Studios.","Horizon Forbidden West builds upon Zero Dawn by adding new enemies, traversal options, combat, and a massive new map to explore. With the absolutely stunning cinematics, gorgeous ecosystems, and compelling story, there’s so much to love about Horizon Forbidden West.","If you loved Zero Dawn and simply wanted more, warts and all, this is easy to recommend. But if you were looking for something groundbreaking with a lot more polish, then Horizon Forbidden West is really a mixed bag.",,,"Aloy’s journey to the Forbidden West is an impressive one on all levels and a showcase of PlayStation 5's capabilities. Better and more refined, Horizon Forbidden West keeps the best parts of its predecessor, improves upon them and adds new gameplay elements. A must buy for PlayStation 5 owners.","Horizon Forbidden West is a superb sequel, adding even more robot monsters to slay while introducing a deep crafting and upgrade system that creates a rewarding Monster Hunter-style gameplay loop. Platforming still feels clunky and there are a few annoying technical issues at launch, but this is still one of the best first-party games to arrive on PS5 yet.","The main conclusion that we have arrived at after spending hours and hours with Horizon Forbidden West is very simple, the new generation of consoles is finally here. No, this is not Playstation's first exclusive worthy of mention, but it's visually imposing, gigantic in content and production values, very well written and interpreted, and has an entertaining gameplay that sometimes touches what we call excellence. Welcome back, my dear Aloy.","Horizon: Forbidden West does a great job of building on the foundation that Zero Dawn laid out; everything is more beautiful, the stakes are – somehow – higher, and the flirtations with BioWare-style story ideas shows just how much of a future this series has. The exploration and combat pillars of the game sing in harmony, too… it’s just a shame that there’s so much sludgy filler amongst all that well-oiled machine killer.","Horizon: Forbidden West is everything I wanted from a follow-up to the excellent Zero Dawn, from the twisting story and fierce combat to the cast of memorable characters. Playing this for the first time felt like getting back on a bicycle, and before long I was traveling the wilds with Aloy just as we did before. There are a few technical missteps, and some of Aloy's dialogue sounds forced, but the majority of the game is simply amazing. I couldn't wait to get back into the world of Horizon after Zero Dawn, and now I can't wait to return again after playing Forbidden West.","A triumphant combination of enthralling combat, top-tier creature and character design, and a captivating open world, Horizon Forbidden West is an absolute blast and fantastic showcase for the power of the PS5.","Forbidden West is an ideal sequel to Zero Dawn, everything that worked in the last game is the same or better, and everything that didn't work is mostly fixed. In addition, there are beautiful graphics, an exciting story, and a demonstration of the extreme limits that the classic open-world action genre can reach.",,"Everything about this game just feels good. It’s beautiful, narratively complex, empowering, and a true testament to what the PS5 can do.","While it’s far from perfect — its set piece moments could use some work, and its cross-generation release limits some of its ambition — Horizon: Forbidden West does more than enough right to deserve your time and attention. It’s a big enough game that you can pick and choose your favorite things to do and have a full experience, and the story it tells compels you to keep going and see more.",,"Horizon Forbidden West is a spectacular sequel to one of the PS4's best exclusives. Its narrative is one of its strengths, with unforgettable characters and twists and turns that maintain a solid pace throughout, and it's combat has been expanded on, adding in new weapon and ammo types to make eliminating machines and humans an immensely satisfying experience. All of this is wrapped up in a world that feels more alive and meticulously crafted than its predecessor with visuals and animations that bring that special blockbuster feel Sony's exclusives are now renowned for to the PS5.",,"Horizon Forbidden West is everything you could hope for in a sequel. Not only does it provide more content to sink your teeth into, but it makes smart design decisions that refine its systems to be near faultless. Aloy’s personal story continues to evolve, this time with an even stronger supporting cast and memorable antagonists propelling her journey to another level. Above all, its moment-to-moment gameplay expertly combines the fun traversal, exciting combat, and creative problem-solving to awesome effect, meaning it always feels excellent to play. Horizon Forbidden West is one of the best open-world adventures available today and is a stellar experience from its strong introduction all the way to its dramatic conclusion, and beyond.","Horizon Forbidden West builds upon the formula of the first game in smart (if not always revolutionary) ways to craft an even stronger open-world experience. The stunning visuals make for a great showpiece of what Sony’s first-party studios can accomplish on PlayStation 5, with gameplay that holds up its end of the bargain. Unfortunately, storytelling missteps and a lack of polish keep Aloy’s latest adventure just shy of joining the all-time greats.","Horizon Forbidden West is an excellent sequel, surpassing its predecessor in almost every area. Guerrilla Games has once again created a diverse and graphically impressive game world that is full of activities and dangers.",,,,"Horizon Forbidden West is, in many ways, a sensational journey. You can definitely tell that Guerrilla Games listened to a lot of the criticisms Zero Dawn received and devoted themselves to fixing them. The result is a game that reinforced the strengths of its first installment and complemented them with a world that feels bursting with life, genuinely exciting combat, and small improvements that deliver an overall experience with fewer bumps in the road. Sadly, several design decisions ended up being a string that limited its potential. Forbidden West could have been a generational impact, but it will pass as just another great open-world adventure.","Horizon Forbidden West expands, improves and deepens all aspects of Horizon Zero Dawn. Guerrilla Games brought to life an incredible open world with fun mechanics, intriguing storytelling and meaningful interactions, despite some technical imperfections.","Horizon Forbidden West does what you'd expect from any blockbuster sequel worthy of the name: by taking the basics of the original episode and improving them as much as possible, Guerilla Games makes sure to hit the mark. There is still room for improvement for a hypothetical Horizon 3, but this is a solid title that hits hard for the beginning of the year of Playstation Studios productions.","Horizon Forbidden West reaches a new high bar for Guerrilla Games. It does more than surpass its predecessor; it takes Horizon’s fiction to captivating places and builds a rich world that rewards you for the effort you put into it. Mostly, it’s an entertaining experience, complete with jaw-dropping moments and unforgettable fights.",,"Horizon Forbidden West is a triumph for Guerrilla Games. It takes the shining promise of Zero Dawn and elevates it in almost every way possible. This truly feels like the RPG the studio has always wanted to make, and I’m so glad that it finally gets to breathe without being overshadowed.","A sequel should always be better, and Horizon Forbidden West is much better than its predecessor, by a distance as great as the journey itself.","Horizon Forbidden West is an excellent second chapter, backed up by top-notch art direction and sekaikan. The plot dares to take an unexpected direction with results that are not entirely appreciable, but overall it is a worthy continuation of Aloy's adventures that deserves to be experienced. PlayStation 4 or 5, it makes no difference.",,,"Horizon Forbidden West improves on its predecessor in nearly every way, offering a stunning follow-up to an already excellent title which shows just how much a game can improve through refinement. Fans of the original will feel immediately comfortable, but they’ll find a far better adventure waiting for them. If you disliked the original game, Forbidden West won’t change your mind, but this is a must-own for everyone else.","[Horizon Forbidden West] is a game of contrasts. A game about robot dinosaurs where you spend far too much time fighting robot meerkats and boars instead for some reason. One with brilliant voice acting that you begin to hate because some characters won't shut up. Where the side quests are great, but they're so simple as to feel pointless. Where the combat features a complex balance between elemental strengths and weaknesses but you can ignore all that via a rain of explosive spearheads.",This brilliant sequel takes all the best parts from its predecessor and turns it up to eleven.,"Horizon Forbidden West makes up for the shortcomings of the first game with its wonderful world, variety of missions and fun gameplay and manages to be a more solid game.","Horizon Forbidden West is superior to its predecessor in almost every way, and Zero Dawn was already a fantastic game. Guerrilla Games takes huge narrative risks that pay off big time, setting up Aloy's greatest threat yet and further developing her relationships. The gameplay is likewise just as excellent, with incredibly responsive and fun combat alongside a vast open world to explore.","Forbidden West is Zero Dawn 1.5, so anyone who enjoyed the first one will love this one. If Zero Dawn hadn't convinced you, there's something to fall in love with now, but know that the recipe is roughly equivalent.","Horizon Forbidden West is a long game set in a huge world, but it earns that massive scope. The length is bolstered by performances as unique as the faces that bring them to life and a topical story that remains compelling throughout. The big map is stacked with small icons, but it all leads in the same direction as you cross expansive hostile terrain toward a threat the game never stops hyping up. Aloy’s observatory dialogue can get redundant and there are some other minor distractions, but the rest of the game is so excellent that none of that matters much in the end. It’s a potent evolution of the first game’s strengths, and the enthusiasm put into every element, from its distinct creatures to its signature combat, always shines through.","Horizon Forbidden West takes everything that made Horizon Zero Dawn an excellent action-adventure title, and adds more environmental variety and quest verticality to create an even better game.",Horizon Forbidden West is absurdly good in so many ways that it borders on must-play for open world aficionados.,"An expansive, beautiful and engrossing new adventure that deepens the series' lore while doubling down on what made the original such a classic. A masterclass in meaningful open-world design, where exploration and curiosity is encouraged and rewarded.","Overall, though, Horizon Forbidden West does a lot more right than it does wrong. It might be jam-packed with stuff to see, do, know, and remember, but when its many systems come together, it can be a beautiful, exciting, and delightful open-world experience. The story that drives you through the frontier is often well-told and does well to center actual characters rather than audio logs, and while the map is littered with icons, it's much more often that they're fun, skillfully crafted diversions than random busywork to fill a checklist. There's a huge amount to do and see in Horizon Forbidden West, and the great majority of it is worth doing and seeing thanks to strong writing, great visuals, and some marked improvements to the series' underlying ideas.","As an action-adventure, an RPG, a narrative, and open-world sandbox, and a way to simply spend time exploring a breathtaking world – it falls short. Engaging at times, thrilling too, but also disjointed, clunky, and unfocused in ways we didn’t expect.","Horizon Forbidden West, by most counts, is another strong release for Guerrilla Games and PlayStation. This is very much a sequel that just looks to go bigger and better than its predecessor, and in that regard, it very much achieves what it sets out to accomplish. Although I wanted more from the story and the game's general structure is very much the same when compared to Zero Dawn, fans who loved the last title should still love the adventure that this follow-up takes you on.","Horizon Forbidden West is an excellent sequel that attempts to pad out too much in its content, but the core story still remains remarkable. I love Aloy and this story continues to be one of the more interesting out there. Sony continues to deliver excellent first-party content and while the glitches did turn me off at first, the patch seems to have addressed most of the issues. There is a ton to love here and I really loved coming back to this world. This is a must own for PlayStation owners.",,,"Horizon Forbidden West is a competently made and fun action-adventure that channels Monster Hunter during its big boss encounters, and every Sony-made open-worlder during the gameplay. Still, there’s a reason these games are churned out each year. Forbidden West is stronger than its predecessor and rewards you for investing your time with a series of fun weapons, gadgets and narrative beats, but it still can’t resist getting in its own way.","Horizon Forbidden West improves on just about every aspect of its predecessor with better combat, machines, and traversal.","It’s clear that Horizon Forbidden West considers itself more than just an action adventure game with cool weapons, robots and climbing, though. So much of it feels great to play. So much of its world is a joy to inhabit. So many of its quests deliver more than just open world fluff, but Aloy’s uninspired arc could’ve been more. This is a significantly more complete sequel, and we’ll almost certainly see a third entry. If Guerilla can nail Aloy’s journey, her legend as a truly iconic character is all but guaranteed.","The story is enthralling from beginning to end, with enough twists and surprises to keep you hooked. The ending, while not as emotional as the first game, effectively lays the groundwork for a potential third game really well. In that respect, it falls victim to Penultimate Instalment Syndrome, a disease I just made up where – you guessed it – the penultimate ending doesn't really stand alone, but rather is used to tease what is coming next. That's not so much a negative, it's just how it is. And it still works. Regardless, this game was well worth the five year wait. It's gorgeous, fascinating and I can't wait for you to play it. Now if you don't mind me, I'm going to research experimental memory-erasing procedures in the hopes of experiencing this game for the first time all over again.","At its core, Horizon Forbidden West is a game about saving the world—both in the sense of preservation, and in the doomsday-averting action that involves shooting supervillains with pointy sticks. It’s about asking ourselves what we’re willing to pay, and lose, to ensure some part of our legacy persists. And it’s about what you can do in a world where the rich and powerful have murdered your future, while greedily ensuring their own lives on. It’s not a masterpiece—masterpieces rarely come this big. But it’s a world worth keeping, nevertheless.","After completing Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, I’ve been searching for something to take up the time that game occupied in my life. I needed something meaty that entertained me while not asking me to invest too much emotion. I wanted something I could play through without being totally mentally present as I recovered from Endwalker’s emotional ravishing, and Horizon Forbidden West perfectly filled that need. It was the video game equivalent of the post-coital cigarette that I’m looking forward to smoking for another 60 hours.",,,"Horizon Forbidden West is a worthy sequel to Zero Dawn in every way, proving that Guerrilla is no one-hit wonder when it comes to the action RPG genre. This huge and beautiful world has an incredible amount of things to do and most of them are really fun, thanks to improvements to combat and traversal. The game also features another great storyline that will get fans talking about the inevitable sequel.",,,,"The time I’ve spent with Horizon Forbidden West has been an absolute blast. I’ve gawked at beautiful landscapes, engaged in frantic fracases with machines, delved into ancient ruins, laughed at snarky dialogue, triumphed in an arena, gotten my butt handed to me in a board game, and much more. I still haven’t seen everything Forbidden West has in store for me, but I’ve seen enough to know it is special, just like its predecessor. This is one of those sequels where the developers have really upped their game in just about every way, and I can’t wait to play more of it!",,,"Better than its capable predecessor, with further room to grow, beautiful Horizon Forbidden West is the rare game that compels me to think my deepest thoughts not for what it is, but for what its franchise can become. The qualitative gap between this pair is enough to make me wonder if a third installment — let’s label it Horizon the Third for now and be thankful for something smarter when it's inevitably announced a few years down the road — can deliver the masterpiece this setting so richly deserves.",,,,"It’s an exhausting, often repetitive, experience just barely held up by a good story, incredible visuals, and competent game design that lifts the best bits from other video games made in the past 10 years...If you’re looking for a revolutionary experience that teaches you what open world games can be, Forbidden West isn’t it. But if you’re looking for a competent distraction that soothes and smooths the brain by repeating what open world games have been doing for years, Forbidden West does the job.",,"As a whole, Horizon Forbidden West tops the original game even if it doesn’t reinvent the wheel in quite the same way. Much like how The Last of Us 2 had a lot to live up to and struggled to do so, but was a superior game technically, the same holds true here. The gameplay here is more exciting as is the moment-to-moment storytelling. The pacing is faster and with that comes a bit less time for the story to breathe at points. However, it’s still a great story overall and one that keeps the player engaged from start to finish. Forbidden West is a fantastic looking, sounding and playing experience that benefits from the addition of motion controls in way that few AAA-level games have showcased before. If you enjoyed the original game, be sure to pick up the sequel – although newcomers can enjoy the action just as much, as the story can be easy to get lost in without knowing the cast and the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mortal-kombat-11-ultimate,,,,,,,,"A gory, glorious celebration of violence with more content than you'll find in any other fighting game.

I will say that it’s a shame that just days after Ultimate was released there came word of yet more DLC for the game (the 1995 movie skin and voiceover pack) which is of course not included in Ultimate. I have had some friends lament some frustration over how monetized MK11 is, and I absolutely see where they’re coming from. It’s not a business practice I like to see because we’re used to games having a final, all inclusive edition released and we just don’t have that with MK11. Maybe we’ll see a Komplete Edition like there was with MK9. Regardless, you can’t really go wrong with MK11U if you’re looking for a superb fighting game on current or next-gen.",,,,"Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate Edition is quite clearly a means of selling the same game to those that have (for whatever reason) not yet taken the gore-filled plunge into NetherRealm's latest fight title. Despite this, the entire package remains a forward-thinking and user-friendly initiative. Essentially, this is a free rebranding that offers an optimized experience (and the option to then purchase the three new fighters) that doesn't force consumers to re-buy the entire game again. Publisher WB Games deserves kudos for applying a much more consumer-friendly, piecemealed rendition of the Street Fighter iterative formula to Mortal Kombat, with a complete package that screams ""get over here"" to those that have yet to dive in.",,,,"It’s an intense, immensely enjoyable game with deep gameplay mechanics, great cast of characters and so much content that it’s impossible to unlock everything in a lifetime (unless you resort to microtransactions).

Its combat might not be as fluid or enjoyable in action as the latest Street Fighter or Tekken, but it makes up for it elsewhere. As fighting games go, none are more generous than Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate, especially when it comes to single-player content.

However, running off a PS5, the improved load times and graphical enhancements are amazing and necessary. It’s a highly optimized game that feels like it was made for the new generation of consoles.

ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut,,,,,,"Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut offers a very nice experience, very complete and extremely generous. Technically and artistically, the game is eye-catching and the game on Ikishima Island allows you to add even more relief to Jin Sakai and TO explore a sublime setting with pretty new features. The PS5 version also allows you to fully immerse yourself in the game with the functions of the DualSense which further energizes the action. The ultimate version of the Sucker Punch game.","The Director's Cut version of Ghost of Tsushima is the ultimate package the fans were waiting for, and even though its price tag still seems unreasonable, all the improvements over the original game and the addition of Iki Island expansion pack will make it worth your while.",,"This is a great version of a great game, with Iki Island giving players some more insight into Jin Sakai's life as a young samurai and give us amazing vistas to enjoy. All that - and they fixed the Japanese lip sync. Hallelujah.","Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut is the best way of experiencing this gorgeous video game. It is maybe not a reason enough for some people who have already completed the game due to its expansion being relatively short and PS5 upgrades not bringing anything “game-changing”, but it is a great piece of content and an upgrade that truly boosts the overall experience that many new players and existing ones will feel and appreciate.",,,"So far, Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut is this year's pinnacle of Open World Games. Iki Island is stunningly beautiful and the technical upgrades make it even more enjoyable. Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut grandly stakes its status as one of the very best open world games on PS5 that proudly stands alongside the best games on the platform. If you've been holding off playing Ghost of Tsushima, now is the time to get playing.",,"Sony is giving us the perfect version of their latest IP, especially for those who didn't try the game before, but for some of us who did, this is a great opportunity to revisit Japan and the new island of Iki.",,"Exploring the brand new Iki island is good for about ten hours of extra game time, taking beautiful and serene pictures with the built-in photo mode easily adds several hours more.

While it is a year-old base game, there’s enough here for both newcomers and veterans alike to warrant another look. Yes, you could save a fair bit of cash going out and buying a 2nd hand PS4 copy. But if you want the most from your shiny new PS5 and are keen to delve into a sublime open-world sword game you really won’t find much better.",,"Honestly, I don’t know what else there is to say about Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut other than that it’s a must-play. That was true of the game last year when it first came out, and it’s just as true now that they’ve refined and perfected it on PS5.","As it stands, Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut is the comprehensive, definitive Ghost of Tsushima experience. Its new multiplayer mode isn't in the game yet but will be coming soon, and in the meantime, fans still have the current Ghost of Tsushima: Legends experience to check out, the base game's story mode with PS5 features, and the substantial Iki Island expansion. Newcomers and returning fans alike have reason to check out Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut, with it hopefully keeping fans satisfied until they can get their hands on Sucker Punch's first game built exclusively with the PlayStation 5 in mind.","Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut is truly a masterpiece, much like its original release. It introduces an entirely new and separate experience with Iki while bringing and refining the beauty of the gameplay and visuals.","Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut is the best version of an accomplished open world adventure with great characters, excellent combat, and a setting that is constantly inviting to explore. While the base game falters in its storytelling, the Iki Island expansion manages to tell a nuanced story of parental influence and the challenge of moving on from the past in spite of your personal allegiances. It’s the most human Jin Sakai has ever been, yet the brief campaign and emphasis on familiar busywork hold it back from potential greatness. If you didn’t like the game before, this won’t change your mind, but fans will find a lot of added brilliance to dig into here alongside a narrative journey well worth taking.",,,"Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is the definitive way to play an already excellent game, complemented by equally engrossing DLC in Iki Island.",,"The game has never looked better, and now stands toe-to-toe with the other Sony tentpoles on the platform. While the gameplay changes aren’t enough to shake the nagging feelings or repetitiveness, engaging combat and a well told story are more than enough reasons to play through the game again.",The arrival of the game on PS5 maximizes everything that is Ghost of Tsushima. If his world was precious now it is even more so. Enjoying the game at 60fps or reaching 4K resolution is something that is noticeable from the first minute and that makes this experience touring feudal Japan even greater.,"It’s more of a regular DLC paired with some improvements for the PS5 rather than a true director’s cut. However, the developers do deserve praise for how skillfully they inserted the expansion into the narrative of the base game. The story about Jin’s past and the sins of ancestors is great (as opposed to boring side quests), new enemies pose a challenge, and the game as a whole shines on PS5’s more powerful hardware. I wish the visual improvements were more noticeable though. [11/2021, p.31]","While PS4 veterans might not get as much value from the re-release, Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut is a wonderful showcase for the PS5 and an incredible package for newcomers.",Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is now the definitive version of an already great game.,"While the value proposition is up for debate, it’s hard to argue against the fact that Ghost of Tsushima has evolved beyond anything we had expected. From the post-launch patches that included improvements based on community feedback, to the full-fledged online co-op mode that was released at no extra cost and with free updates, Ghost of Tsushima is a prime example of how video games should be launched and supported after release. It launched in an already superb state and now it is even better and bolder.","The consistency and foulness of the Iki Island expansion is stunning. Especially compared to many other add-ons. It's well worth the buy, both for fans and wider audience alike.",,,,"Ghost of Tsushima was a great game when it launched just over a year ago. And now, in the form of a Director’s Cut, it’s even better. It seems trite to make a big deal over the visuals not being massively upgraded for next-gen when the game looks so phenomenal anyway, and what has been added – 3D audio and DualSense support – is enough to make the upgrade fee worthwhile for those who already own the original game and want to take on the new Iki Island expansion. That itself is largely more of the same, but its thoroughly engaging story that lets us learn more about Jin Sakai isn’t to be missed by those who were entertained by the game’s main campaign. And so, what else is there to say, other than for newcomers, Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut on PS5 is absolutely essential.",,"Ghost Of Tsushima Director's Cut on PlayStation 5 is undoubtedly the definitive way to experience Sucker Punch's open-world samurai adventure. Improved loading times, enhanced resolutions, smoother frame rates, and a slew of brand-new content make the 2020 game shine in new ways. More than that though, it's given me the chance to reassess a video game that I just previously couldn't see the adoration for.","Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut on PS5 is the best way to play Sucker Punch's masterpiece, with a great new expansion and technological improvements that make this an instant classic.","The update makes elegant use of the PlayStation 5’s controller’s quasi-magical properties. Tilt the controller to guide a note along a musical stave and play a mournful lament on the flute. Wearing the appropriate outfit, haptic buzzes will guide you toward hidden valuables, the force of the pulse quickening the closer you are to the treasure. Despite the intermittent violence, this is a beautiful world to explore, lovingly crafted and compellingly framed.",,"Ghost of Tsushima was an impressive game when it was released a year ago, and this PS5 version is still amazing. It looks great (either on fidelity or performance mode), adds dualsense features, and most important, Iki Island deepens on Jin Sakai story, adding new gameplay mechanics, enemies and environments.","My words will never do justice for Ghost of Tsushima’s brilliance. James Paley summed it up better than I ever could: “[Ghost of Tsushima] revealed itself as a compelling, masterful work of art. Nothing feels useless or extraneous. The story wastes little time, the fights are all exuberant and engaging, the exploration is addicting, and the entire game is gorgeous.” I couldn’t agree more. And the Director’s Cut is miles ahead of the original. Go get it.","Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut refines the formula of the original thanks to its technical improvements and taking advantage of the functions of PS5. The new DLC expands its story and, while it is not to go crazy, it is a good excuse to return to gallop through this samurai adventure that has already made a dent in the hearts of PlayStation players.","If you have never played Ghosts of Tshuima before, the Director’s Cut is a must have and play game due to its carefully crafted story with exceptional gameplay mechanics, graphics and audio. While I would not call it a true next-gen experience, it is very close and Sucker Punch should be commended on creating such an engaging world with its rich visuals that are led by a very interesting protagonist. The world also fees quite organic opposed to a static closed-world which makes exploring such as a treat. Lastly, Jin is a great protagonist who has secrets and a path of redemption ahead of him. If you own the previous game, you can purchase an ‘upgrade’ to the Director’s Cut that is value for money if you loved the original as it adds to the legacy of Jin and tweaks some of the inconsistencies from the original.",,,,,"Ghost of Tsushima Tales of Iki delivers an absolute masterpiece to Sony’s PlayStation 5, alongside a remarkable expansion to an already phenomenal game. Some new mechanics keep things fresh, as does another excellent story from Sucker Punch. While there are a few hiccups to contend with, this is easily a must-have title for the year.","Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut feels like the truest, purest way to experience this title, so much so that I'm willing to go through it once again from the top, when Jin rode into battle with his uncle and almost died. I want to ride through the grass, stumble into duels, climb mountains and battle Mongols for another few dozen hours while making a stop on a freaky island to fight a crazy woman who likes poison and the color purple. I want to do it all, and I would recommend that anyone with the time should look into doing the same. It's still the samurai game of my dreams: Now it looks even better, and there's more of it.","Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut doesn't really surprise anywhere, but it adds roughly ten hours seamlessly to the already strong main game. Iki Island takes the best of the original and just goes the extra mile. Sony's messy cross-gen policy is back with this reissue.","On PS5, all the visuals of Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut stand out even more, to a point that it practically feels like a next-gen title. Thanks to the Iki expansion and all the content that was added and will be added to the Legends mode, Ghost of Tsushima is today one of the most complete games that Sony has to offer.","Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut, and in particular its core offering of the Iki Island expansion, does a great job at giving players more of what made the game's original release special. The brisk new adventure takes Jin Sakai on a journey of reflection and reconciliation that contains plenty of beautiful, memorable moments and some very cool new gear to play with. The updates made for its native PS5 release do feel a touch slim given that they come at an added cost, but they do go a long way to refining and enhancing the experience. A great game made better, then, and a fantastic excuse to spend dozens more hours in Photo Mode.",,,"If you still haven't played Ghost of Tsushima then this Director's Cut is the perfect excuse to finally experience this masterpiece. With a stunning core experience, super-fun online modes, and a brand new campaign, you're in for one outstanding package.",,,,"Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is a bigger and enhanced version of an already very cool game, with a new island to explore, so there's no reason to refuse the invitation.",,,,"Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut amplifies an already excellent open world game. The Iki Island expansion is worth the price of admission alone, providing another chunk of stunning Japanese landscape for Jin to explore, while also digging into the protagonist's past. A fantastic range of story missions and side quests make for a memorable offshore excursion, and put alongside the main campaign, Ghost of Tsushima now stands as a PS4 and PS5 must-buy.","Ghost of Tsushima: Directors Cut improves all technical aspects in its PlayStation 5 version. Not only on a visual level, but also on loading times and the great use of the DualSense controller. It looks great in 4K, although we must say that the expansion does not have great visual improvements. The Isle of Iki complements the campaign well with a new story that involves some mystical aspects, but these blend well into the plot without making them feel out of place.","A great addition to a great game. The Director’s Cut brings a lot of new additions, at least on the PS5, and a whole new island offers many hours of new fun.","Ghost of Tsushima fans need not hesitate and can blindly pay 20 euros for this Director's Cut, because the extra content offers everything a Jin fan could wish for. If you haven't played the original yet, I'd recommend playing the first two acts of Tsushima and then going straight to Iki, because that's the best interactive samurai sensation I can think of.",The underlying game is still too reliant on the Ubisoft formula but the new content and Legends mode make Ghost Of Tsushima Director’s Cut a notably better experience than the original at launch.,A journey that now approaches excellence.,,,"For returning players, Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is well worth diving back into for the Iki Island expansion alone and the way it explores a different facet of Jin's internal conflicts. It may not sate the desire for a full sequel, but it does a lot of cool things to make the experience feel fresh even as it explores the familiar. For brand new players who missed the game on PS4, there's no better way to experience Ghost of Tsushima. An engaging new story chapter will give new players even more insight into Jin and PS5 enhancements improve the entire adventure, which itself was already a technical marvel on last-gen consoles. Sony's experiment into re-releasing last-gen games on the new consoles with meaningful additions is so far paying off.",,"Ghost of Tsushima arrives on PlayStation 5 with a beefy, mystique expansion, a promising multiplayer mode and a bunch of next-gen features... and confirms itself as one of the best samurai games ever made.","Ghost of Tsushima – Director’s Cut is the best way to play Sucker Punch’s samurai-adventure. Especially PS5-gamers receive to full Next-Generation-experience, enjoying a visual masterpiece supported by great features for the dualsense-controller. The “Island Iki”-expansion on the other hand doesn’t deliver too much new stuff, but feels like a “Best of” of Ghost of Tsushima and fits well into the game.",,,,"The PS4 original is enhanced in clever ways on PS5, and what you do on Iki island builds on the lore and ideas of the main game in clever ways. A must-play on PS5. [Issue#6, p.80]","Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut offers an expansion that learns some lessons from the original game, betting on a better development of protagonist, antagonist and the conflict that links them to the island of Iki.",,,,,I can’t remember a game that sustains an awe-inspiring presentation for just about every second you play.,"I’m delighted that, with the changes in Director’s Cut, I’m getting a “play-it-the-right-way-the-first-time” feeling as I do. I’m impressed with Jin Sakai as a character, and the early moral conflict of whether his principles, or the people those principles protect, matter the most. Tsushima itself is beautiful and richly illustrated, enough that I get a sense of place despite never visiting anything like that island in real life. [Impressions]","Ghost of Tsushima is one of the best samurai games of all time and the Director’s Cut only excels it further. Sucker Punch Productions’ work on reimagining thirteen century Japan is a grand achievement, creating a captivating world filled with an exceeding amount of things to do, while implementing an engaging, memorable combat system.",,"A great game released now with a great expansion that doesn’t fix its repetitive nature. Also, it would have been great to have at least some sort of noticeable graphical update for PS5 to match the fantastic DualSense implementation.","While the Director’s Cut improvements are appreciated, the Iki Island expansion is the real star of this release. Iki Island distills all the best parts of Ghost of Tsushima into one focused experience, and it provides an incredibly compelling reason to return to the game.",,,"Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut has improved the graphic of the game greatly. The newly added Iki Island brings new stories and challenges, and further extended the story background. For players who have already cleared the game, playing the Director's Cut version is still an unforgettable experience.",,"Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is the best version of an excellent game, thanks not only to various technical and quality-of-life improvements, but also a meaty and brilliant new expansion that builds on the base game's biggest strengths in all the right ways.",,"Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut is the definitive edition of a game that, if you haven't played yet, is certainly worth a try.","The wind that blows from the island of Iki, at times, can be even more overwhelming than the one that crossed the horizons of Tsushima. Short but incisive, the expansion sets up an intimate narrative, which delves even deeper into the tormented meanders of Jin's soul: it succeeds, and convinces us. The new map and the timid additions to the gameplay do not exponentially increase the variety and quality of an experience that, as expected, remains conservative, with the same merits and the same stumbling blocks as the base game. If the lock on has a fluctuating implementation, which does not solve the problems of a camera that is far from flawless, it is the art direction (again!) And the use of DualSense that make the difference: a sign of how Ghost of Tsushima , also and above all in the Director's Cut, is an adventure that stands out mainly for its evocative visual flashiness. And now - thanks to the PS5 pad - also sensory.",This is definitely how do you want to experience and live Jin Sakai's journey.,,,,,"The new Iki Island expansion offers a compelling story and a new area for fans to explore. The technical improvements for PlayStation 5 make a great game even better, and anyone who hasn’t experienced Jin’s journey should definitely try out the Director’s Cut edition.",,"The biggest part of what lies within Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut is not new, but we are standing before a flash flood of content from the best that Playstation has given us in the past few years with new additions and improvements that are more than enough to deserve the attention of all those who complimented the game in the past. The story of Jin in Iki is well framed and is not narratively superficial, and the consequences will be felt as soon you find him again, which bears to mind that this expansion is also a good sample of what it may be a sequel free from the bindings that hold down Gen 8, with the same aesthetical identity but with a new power to explore.",,,,,,Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s cut is the definitive way to play one of 202’s greatest titles.,,,,"If you've been looking for more Jin Sakai in your life, then the Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut will happily fulfil that request. After a year of post-launch support, Iki Island feels like a fresh checklist of content to tick off. It won't break the mould, but it will keep your sword sharp for the inevitable sequel, and if this is your first time jumping into the game then you're in for one of Sony's finest adventures.","Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is a stunning upgrade to an already excellent title and brings forth some fantastic updates to the PS5 version of the game that enhance, deepen, and expand the gameplay experience. Other than the very minor complaint of some dark visuals, there is a whole lot to love on offer here, and I was delighted to have another reason to join Jin on a new, exciting adventure in feudal Japan. Ghost of Tsushima was already a must-play title, and with the Director's Cut here there really is no excuse to not experience one of the greatest new IPs PlayStation has to offer.",,,,,,,"A refined and improved edition of the base game, not free from defects but still full of interesting news, warmly recommended to all lovers of the genre.","Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is without a doubt an improvement on the original title in terms of performance, comfort, but also content. More than ever, it gives an almost cinematic experience in single player, with a successful mix of exploration, infiltration and sword fighting. As for the new island, it won't change the routine of the fights, but it's still a change of scenery and its story is quite interesting. Without revolutionizing its recipe, this makes Ghost of Tsushima an excellent game that we highly recommend for both its single and multiplayer modes.","I was happily surprised by the breadth, depth, and challenge of the Iki Island expansion. For new players, it will extend an already lengthy adventure into something more. Meanwhile, returning players should be thrilled at how well this experience dovetails out of an already stellar game. Iki Island is what I want out of single-player game expansions. And it’s further proof (as if we needed any more at this point) that Sucker Punch has a standout new property to continue building on.",,,"Newcomers and veterans alike should draw their swords for this one, because Ghost of Tsushima excels on the PS5 and strikes just shy of perfection.","A year later, Ghost of Tsushima is still a great game, and this Director's Cut is the definitive version, especially if you own a PlayStation 5. It's a great experience, but it's mainly for newcomers: the improvements are welcome, but hardly enough to tempt veterans of the original.",,,,,,Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut allows us to return to that unforgettable atmosphere and fun combat system despite the short new story content.,"If you haven't played it before, Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is the way to go, offering an expansive journey of a one-man war against the Mongols. If you've already bought the main game, the upgrade is a little tenuous, but players who enjoyed the first go-around should find plenty to like here as well.","More of Ghost of Tsushima is always welcome. A solid adventure that subtly explores the past of Jin Sakai, and a version that honors the PS5.",,"Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut offers a new, explorable island and several welcome PS5-exclusive enhancements. It is a worthy upgrade of an already exceptional title.","If you’ve already played through what the core game has to offer, Iki Island is a reasonably priced expansion (as is the PS5 upgrade). I do wish it had just a little bit more to offer, but I will take it over nothing. If you loved what this game already had to offer, how could you turn down more of it?","Refinements made to the core game make Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut feel fresh, but the additions within the truly excellent Iki Island expansion elevate the game to completely new heights.",,,"Whether you have played Ghost of Tsushima before and are simply looking to upgrade on PS5, or you have never experienced Sucker Punch's latest title, Director's Cut is definitely worth picking up. Not only has the PS5 improved the base version of the game that launched in 2020, but the Iki Island expansion on its own contains some of my favorite content in the entirety of Ghost of Tsushima. No matter how you might look to upgrade or purchase the new offerings that have been included, Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is definitely worth the return trip to Tsushima.",Iki Island is a nice addition to an already amazing game. For anyone who hasn’t experienced Ghost of Tsushima you are in for a treat. For players like me returning to the world it is worthy content. The expansion can last anywhere from 5-10 hours depending on your completion mentality. It is a worthy expansion worth the price of admission and as good of an excuse as any to revisit one of the best games of last generation.,,,"Ghost of Tsushima: Directors Cut builds on the entire Tsushima experience, good and bad. While the slower pacing and drip fed rewards work for me, some will find the pace sluggish and find their attention wandering elsewhere. Still, this is probably the best chance of living inside a Akira Kurosawa movie you’ll ever get. It’s an opportunity worth taking.",,"Expect a video game, warts and all, but one that, when boiled down to its core aim of lethal, bloody combat, fully understands the joy of making every button press feel deadly.",,,,"Well done update for a great game. Lots of new content is complemented by a ton of new gameplay elements. More content was missing from the basic game, otherwise there was nothing to complain about. And now everything is fine. Reason to buy Playstation 5 if you don't already have one.",,,"If you fell in love with Ghost of Tsushima, this Director's Cut is essential in your library, as it allows you to once again enjoy the wonderful technical display of the original adventure with refreshing content and perfectly using the great power of PlayStation 5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Whether you played Ghost of Tsushima before on PS4 or are completely new to it, Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is well worth your time on PS5 with its stunning visuals, great use of PS5 features, excellent combat, and superlative soundtrack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-nioh-collection,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There's no getting around it, this is an astounding proposition. Bringing together two of the best action RPGs of the PlayStation 4 era with a range of eye-opening PlayStation 5 enhancements, Nioh Remastered: The Complete Collection is absolutely essential for anybody who has even the slightest interest in great action RPGs with hugely rewarding combat systems and hundreds of hours of challenging gameplay.",,,,,"Nioh Collection for PS5 is the best way to enjoy an essential series for lovers of RPG and action. Hundreds of hours of gameplay with all the content released so far, an agile, unique and demanding combat system and unique character and combat style customization possibilities.",,,,"Overall Nioh and its sequel are a worthy additions to the Soulslike genre, both games are fun and incredibly challenging and the Yokai look every bit the part of a Japanese demon. The biggest issue with this collection is the popup on the original Nioh, though aside from this it is a good collection. Also if you already own Nioh on the PS4, make sure you are playing the PS5 version by clicking on the options button and selecting the PS5 version (the first time I launched Nioh on PS5, I was playing the PS4 version). Also, of note, if you have the PS4 version of Nioh 2, you can upgrade that to the PS5 version for free, but the original game you will have to purchase in order to get the remastered edition.",,"The remastered versions of NIOH and NIOH 2 are outstanding. Visually they are nearly equal to each other and both still maintain the core enjoyment of the series, which is dying over and over again while slowly but surely progressing. Of course, those deaths are in 4K with a high frame rate via PlayStation 5, which makes the experience far more entertaining.",,,"If you hadn't played the Nioh games previously - perhaps concerned over their difficulty - then don't let it miss you the second time. They are difficult, but that was essential in setting the desperate, nightmare tone and atmosphere. One other key takeaway that I've had from replaying both games for the remaster is this: what nearly made me quit the first time around has become comfortable now. The learning curve is glacially slow, but you do actually ""learn"" how to play these games, and there's a real sense of reward that comes from pushing through. Now, if you have played these title already, the upgrade isn't anything to write home about but, then again, perhaps you just want two brilliant games on your PlayStation 5. It's not like either Nioh is going to age poorly; you're going to want to revisit them at some point. You may as well play the best version.",,,,,"The Nioh Collection brings two bright stars of the Soulslike constellation to PS5, slightly improved and accompanied by six DLCs. I found the first Nioh very satisfying, addictive and immensely fun as a whole, but the sequel turned out to be a chore because its absurd difficulty level was too much for me. [05/2021, p.28]",,,"The Nioh Collection confidently slashes through these minor oversights because it is still a definitive duo of difficult classics that play, look, and feel better than ever before. Even though its sequel is easily the superior, more varied title, both are still genre-defining action RPGs that provide so many engaging encounters that crush players to a pulp as a means to make them work for their euphoric victories. Few games can master this balance and maintain it after dozens or hundreds of hours and this collection has two such titles, doubling the amount of pain while also simultaneously doubling the amount of satisfaction.","The collection for the PlayStation 5 is the perfect gift for Hidetaki Miyazaki's fans, who are waiting for an Elden Ring by FromSoftware right now.",,,,"For PS5 owners who have yet to take a chance on the Nioh series, The Nioh Collection is a must-have, providing they’re up for a challenge. Nioh Remastered – The Complete Edition and Nioh 2 Remastered – The Complete Edition, both also available separately, are expertly-crafted games that are hard to pick fault with. Across both titles there’s literally hundreds of hours of adventuring to be done, and thanks to leveraging the power of the PS5 the action has never looked or played better. It’s those with TVs capable of high frame rates that will get the most out of it though; these games really display the benefit of 120fps.",First time you're hearing about The Nioh Collection? It's a great pick up for your PS5 and one of the best franchises of the last generation! But if you've been grinding away on the PS4 version? Maybe wait for a sale.,,"The Nioh Collection as a whole is an amazing experience for those who crave a massive, steep, yet incredibly rewarding RPG challenge.",,,,,"Nioh Collection is a very good opportunity to start in the saga and take advantage of its technical improvements; and also to continue the adventure thanks to the possibility of importing your games. It's true that we will not take our hands to the head for its technical issues, but framerate and 4K resolution helps to offer a better experience.","While not a new game, The Nioh Collection provides excellent value for money and literally hundreds of hours of gameplay. If you like a challenging RPG in the same vein of Demon Souls, then The Nioh Collection is a must play experience that works a treat on the PlayStation 5, including its next-gen use of Dualsense.",,,,,"The Nioh Collection does come at a premium asking price, but for your $69.99 you’ll pick up a pair of games with easily over 150 hours of gameplay, with brand new visual modes to make it look its very best. Granted, this is a Team Ninja game so you can expect that it will punish you for each and every inch of ground you gain, but when you do succeed it makes it all the more sweet.",,,,,,,,,,,"Nioh Collection is the best way to play NIoh & Nioh 2 in early 2021. But if you have already played it, the interest is limited.",,,,"The Nioh Collection crams two great games and six story expansions into one complete, content-stuffed package. Despite its extensiveness, the lack of exclusive content or noteworthy new features make it a hard sell in its entirety. It gives Ninja Theory a good excuse to try and grab some more attention for some legitimately great games, but calling these remasters is perhaps a bit of an embellishment.",,"If you already played both games, there’s no reason to do it again.

Technical matters aside, both games are must-haves if you enjoy this type of challenge.",,,,,,"The Nioh Collection is the definitive way to play the series, for newcomers and veterans alike.",,,"Overall, therefore, the remasters of Nioh 1 and 2 boast a solid and satisfying performance profile, while not marking a clear step forward compared to the previous versions of the two titles, at least as regards the general performance of the graphics sector.",,,,,,The ultimate Nioh Collection. It includes tons of content and the graphical overhaul is impressive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Unsurprisingly, Nioh 1 and 2 PS5 remaster is more of a Next-Gen patch. The result isn't amazingly beautiful, but it's responsive enough in 4K that we can no longer blame frame drops for our numerous deaths. If you haven't tested the license yet and are looking for a challenge, this is a good opportunity.","The Nioh Collection is a worthwhile return for seasoned pros to experience optimized visuals, DLC content, or different weapons and skills. For new players, this remastered collection is absolutely the best way to experience the Nioh games. Just be aware of what demonic delights you’re signing up for!",,,"The Nioh Collection on PlayStation 5 collects two excellent and instant classics together in one well polished and tough experience that will give new console owners something to sink their teeth into for the foreseeable future, while bringing with it, technical improvements that take advantage of the more capable hardware.","On PS5, The Nioh Collection offers the refined gameplay that allowed Nioh 1 & 2 to distinguish themselves within the soulslike genre, but with the added perks of 4K resolution, 120 fps and quick loading times. The DualSense’s haptic feedback also reacts to some of our inputs, but the feeling is that more could have been done. Nevertheless, the Nioh Collection is an excellent package for anyone who wants to experience Team Ninja’s take on the genre.",,,,,"The Nioh Collection consists of two demanding games in the so-called Soulsborne genre, a genre that in its best moments dances on a fine line between frustration and joy. The two Nioh games offer over 100 hours of just that. It is extremely difficult and frustrating, but also rewarding and fair. In this Playstation 5 incarnation, the two games are better than ever, but at the same time the jump from the original versions is not massive. If you are a fan of the genre and have not played the Nioh games before, however, this is the perfect opportunity.",,,"It still feels good to play Nioh again, especially when it is done on its best version ever. The content available on The Nioh Collection is mind blowing. The ability to play the game either in 4K60 or 120hz or even to enjoy PS5 visual upgrades on a regular screen with the PS5 Standard Mode brings a lot of comfort to the players, even though the engine and the level design are somewhat outdated, with aliasing and texture popping everywhere.The lack of loading screens and the use of the Dualsense are also great additions.",,,,"Two fantastic games from the last generation get a makeover, leaning into the substantial muscle of the PS5 to deliver a stunning new experience at the dawn of a new console generation",,,,,"The Nioh Collection brings two of the most satisfying last-gen games to next-gen, offering improvements both new and returning players are sure to love.

gran-turismo-7,,,"Gran Turismo 7 is a saint without miracles and has Lewis Hamilton, Igor Fraga and another legion of professional players as apostles. With an iconic Formula 1 driver and the Brazilian Gran Turismo Sport world champion advocating in its favor, who would I be to say a single word against this title? Well, I have several words for what Gran Turismo could do to be a better racing game, but nothing that could tarnish the reputation of this letter to motorsport fans. It's a game with impeccable gameplay, incredible graphics, and makes an ode to the history of motorsport, with the potential to suck up thousands of hours of gameplay (playing alone or online), this year and beyond. If you're a fan of racing games, you won't regret playing it and having it in your collection. Perhaps my biggest mistake was creating expectations for this title. I swore that this was the ideal time for the Gran Turismo series to go back to being revolutionary as it was in the past, but Kazunori Yamauchi chose to just follow the teachings of your old testament.","Beyond its technical excellence, then, Gran Turismo 7 feels deeply, idiosyncratically personal in ways firstparty games rarely do. [Issue#370, p.100]",,,"Polyphony Digital is back with a bang, and while some may argue that Forza is a better all-round racing game, there is no reason why we can’t enjoy them both, as Gran Turismo 7 is a beast of its own.","It may have feet firmly planted in the past but Gran Turismo 7 delivers some staggering attention to details when it comes to its cars. Tuning having a tangible, audible difference and the great handling make me realise how focused Digital Polyphony can be. The café menus might streamline the campaign a touch too much but I really enjoyed my time powering through them. The weather effects are exemplary and the individuality of each car really shines.","The campaign might be a bit lacking, but the overall quality of Gran Turismo 7 outshines any minor gripe I might have had with the game. Simply put, it's an excellent addition to the series, hampered only by it's ""Always Online"" mandate for the campaign.","Gran Turismo 7 establishes itself as a racing masterpiece, with a great driving model, astonishing graphics and excellent sound design. It is truly a marvel that is drawn back by its microtransactions and some weird design choices.","I can’t help admiring its purity and focus. Gran Turismo 7 seemingly has one mission: to espouse and share its love of cars and their place in wider culture. Its curated catalogue, pretty history books and gleaming showrooms are presented with dutiful care and attention. So much so that it is easy to find yourself lost in the history of the Volkswagen or Aston Martin before you know it. And once you get those cars out on the track? That’s the best part of all.",,"Though Gran Turismo 7 certainly carries the baggage of some of the weaker elements from previous games, a steadfast return to the generous single-player campaign offerings of old, together with a significantly upgraded visual presentation and most importantly a deeply felt love for cars that bleeds through every aspect of the game all ensures that one single statement is true. Gran Turismo is back.","If we were scoring Gran Turismo 7 on its racing alone, we’d be looking at a five-star game that’s also packed with nostalgia and charm. However, the early hours will be sluggish for racing game fans, the car line-up could be more diverse, and the online experience currently tarnishes the amazing on-track gameplay.","Gran Turismo 7 takes the series back to its roots. The visuals are outstanding, and the content is vast. It's a treat for all fans of racing simulators.",Kazunori Yamauchi and Polyphony Digital bring together 25 years of experience in the Gran Turismo franchise and all the benefits of PlayStation 5 to deliver Gran Turismo 7. An incredible game that borders on perfection.,"GT7 is a stunning racing game that hardly has its match. But what starts as a paean to praise, we want to nuance. Despite the many positive elements, it is far from a perfect game. Perhaps its biggest flaw - and it's very bizarre to have to say this about a racing game - is its lack of pace. Don't get us wrong, the track feel while racing is fantastic. But once off the track, the game does everything it can to slow things down.","Gran Turismo 7 has recaptured the hallmarks of the series and immediately becomes the most comfortable piece of driving in living memory. Polyphony Digital has put all the pieces together, taking the best from the early episodes of the series and the advances of the HD era. The result is a polished, perfected control and feel at the wheel, matched by a dizzying array of technology. All in all, it demonstrates the three fundamental pillars of the series: racing, collecting and photography. Despite its mediocre collision engine, a far cry from the physics system, an AI that can be improved and some convoluted menus, Gran Turismo 7 is a declaration of love to the world of motorsport. Its didactic commitment and appreciation for every car makes all the difference. Gran Turismo is synonymous with racing, but not only that. Accessible and deep at the same time, this is a must-have for cars enthusiasts, a title with the potential to last an entire generation.","Gran Turismo is back with better visuals than ever, offering a wide array of content for both die-hard fans and newcomers. While the GT Cafe does a great job at guiding the player through the game, for old fans used to more freedom it might feel a bit too constrained. On top of change of weather and time of day, small details such as smoke coming off the tires go a long way in creating a more realistic racing scene. It’s great to have the classic GT Simulation Mode back, but I can’t deny the game left me with a thirst for more innovation.",It is much more accessible than before but still retains all that juicy motorsport detail under the hood...A little more of the fun factor on the next iteration will elevate this series even further.,PlayStation consoles are receiving a new and very successful exclusive that only comes to reaffirm the intense and very strong sense of identity that has been forged for so many years.,"Gran Turismo fans should know what they are getting into with each and every new release, and Gran Turismo 7 is overall the very best in the franchise yet. The sheer amount of content and modes will keep casual players, long time GT fans and car enthusiasts busy for a very long while, and the online and social features should continue to keep the community alive and racing for years to come.","Time will tell how fans will react to Gran Turismo 7's microtransactions, but putting them aside, what's there is still a deep racing game experience that will keep fans of the genre busy for hours on end. It's a gorgeous racing game and while it's not going to be knocking down any boundaries to convert non-racing game fans, Gran Turismo 7 should greatly appeal to its target audience.","Gran Turismo 7 is a game made for car enthusiasts. It wants to ignite a passion in players for the expansive, rich world of vehicle customization and racing simulation. Polyphony Digital’s dedication to creating one of the most realistic simulations on the market shows in every drop of rain and every reflective sheet of metal. While Gran Turismo 7 may not be for everyone, it provides curious players with an engaging system of progression that will slowly reveal the depth the game has to offer. From breakneck speeds at the Daytona 500 to moonlit races at the Tokyo Expressway, Gran Turismo 7 is a technical marvel and a PlayStation 5 spectacle.","Otherwise, Gran Turismo 7 is hard to fault. I can't think of another racing game I've accidentally played for 5 hours straight without leaving the couch. The racing is thrilling, the cars are a joy to drive, the tracks are magnificent, and the career is well structured. I haven't even talked about the photo mode, which is one of the best I've seen in a game. All the screenshots in this review were taken with it. I haven't fully dipped into multiplayer yet either, which has the potential to spawn a thriving competitive scene. There's just so much, and I can't imagine wanting to play another racing sim any time soon.","Everything that made GT Sport so good, plus everything that made early Gran Turismo games so good. A simply stunning driving game and a superb showcase for PS5.","I often say that racing games are, in so many ways, where boundaries get pushed. Between the work that goes into the physics engines, and creating visual environments (and cars) that are gorgeous to look at in all lighting and weather conditions, whether in motion or in screenshots, racing games give us more progress than I think we generally give them credit for. With that in context, Gran Turismo 7 is a masterpiece. Rather than being little more than a wall of sound and speed, as so many other racing games are, GT7 not only gives us excellent racing action, but it is one of the most loving homages to cars. Gran Turismo 7 is, indeed, the most perfect fan service we've seen to date.",Gran Turismo 7 is a triumphant return for the series.,"If you searched for synonyms to racing simulator genre, Gran Turismo 7 would surely come up first. The new game plays it safe, and you get exactly what you pay for. Stunning graphics, great simulation mechanics, a huge amount of car alterations and a humongous number of cars themselves. There is a lot to see and experience but unfortunately a lot to read too. After many races I can tell you that career is good enough, but Music Rally was my jam (pun intended).","If you can suffer through the clunky menus, endless dull dialogue and 100 visits to the cafe, then there’s an excellent racing game somewhere hidden in Gran Turismo 7. It’s baffling that the game does its best to impede you from getting to the track, but when you actually get there, there’s a lot of fun to be had.","Gran Turismo 7 stands at the peak of simulation, and not just regarding driving games. Furthermore, the game goes above and beyond anything seen before, making it seem even slightly 'erotic' for car lovers: observing your cars, taking pictures of them and enjoying some relaxing moments are all core parts of the Gran Turismo 7 experience. In conclusion, the game is a perfect mix of both elegance and pure competition.","The latest entry in the Gran Turismo series is a safe sequel that’s stuck in the old ways, but thanks to its rich inheritance, the game is also huge in terms of content and shows a spark of pure genius just like its predecessors.","While some off-track quirks diminish the experience somewhat, Gran Turismo 7’s excellent gameplay places it firmly ahead of most of the racing game genre.","Gran Turismo 7 isn't the second coming of racing games, and it doesn't need to be.","Despite these throwaway modes and some repetitive grinding, Gran Turismo 7 does so much right that it’s still a true comeback for the series following Gran Turismo Sport’s disappointing reception. There’s plenty to do here both for car enthusiasts and GT newcomers alike, so much so that I’d wager this will pave the way for a whole new generation of petrolheads. From its photo-realism to its pinpoint handling and extensive amount of additional features, Gran Turismo 7 is another first-party PS5 success and a new benchmark for performance and visuals on the console.",Every new Gran Turismo game always feels like a truly important event. There is no other game series that treats its subject matter with such care and respect. Gran Turismo 7 is a must buy for every person who can appreciate racing as a sport.,"Gran Turismo 7 is a triumphant return for Polyphony. Being so much more than a simple racing game, it's a car enthusiast’s dream come true, with precise driving controls, fancy and immersive menus, and a soundtrack and presentation that tops it all off.","More than how it looks or plays, I appreciate Gran Turismo 7's vibe. It's just pleasant.","A detailed driving simulation with impressive fidelity and presence in an approachable package, Gran Turismo 7 is confident, handsome, and endearing.","Has Gran Turismo 7 fulfilled all of our wildest dreams? Unfortunately not. And for some players the new career structure, unwieldy menus and drone-like A.I. might really knock their duck off. But for those prepared to scratch under the surface and accept that not everything can be perfect, there's one hell of a racing game to be enjoyed here. Although to call it a racing game is perhaps reductive: this is about the love of cars just as much it is about racing them. Whether you want to learn about the history of some of the most iconic cars in the world, take stunning photographs, complete your car collection or race others online, this is the game for you. This is Gran Turismo, and there's nothing else quite like it.","Kazunori Yamauchi wasn’t lying when he promised a paradise that celebrated car culture. Gran Turismo 7 is undoubtedly the most immersive driving sim out there today. It celebrates the series' rich history from 1997 and brings many new additions into the formula. For all fans, from those who just want to drive some cool looking cars to those who are die-hard competitive racers, this game has got something for you.","I’m thrilled to say that this is the best GT game I’ve played in the better half of a decade. It’s not without a few bumps in the road, but they’re nothing that will keep avid racers away. It serves as both a perfect first experience for new racers, and a welcome homecoming for those who have been away for a while.","Gran Turismo 7 is a wonderful celebration of 25 years as the top racing franchise. It looks stunning, and is filled with so much to do.","It’s reassuring that despite ever-greater technical refinement, Gran Turismo’s unique, eccentric character remains intact. It’s present in the grab-bag mission mode, which handily demonstrates that a race between 17 brake horsepower Fiat 500s can be just as gripping as one between cars with 50 times that. It manifests most obviously in the utterly bemusing music rally mode, which has you hitting checkpoints to the strains of 80s pop relic Hooked on Classics. Keeping this distinctive spirit alive in the era of 4K and 60 frames a second, Gran Turismo 7 feels both fresh and comfortingly familiar.","Gran Turismo 7 offers a great variety of cars, tracks and locations in glorious detail. It takes quite a long time to unlock it all though. The campaign has been replaced by menus in the cafe, but still requires (too) many activities before the entire game is unlocked and everything is available. However, what IS available is of the highest standards.","Polyphony Digital comes back to the roots with a driving simulator that feels better than ever by doing the same as ever, thanks to a very unique style. It has some little issues in terms of balance, but, inside the tracks and beyond them, it is a worthy successor of 25 years of Gran Turismo legacy.","Gran Turismo 7 is the best driving game I’ve ever played. Period. It’s not a hardcore simulation of the likes of Assetto Corsa Competizione or iRacing, but for my money, I now prefer Gran Turismo. It’s the ultimate celebration of something that’s part of Kazunori Yamauchi’s very being and an incredible effort to bring his love for automobiles to the world. See you on the starting line.","Gran Turismo 7 is a love letter to the world of motor racing that will reach both lovers of speed, as well as those who simply want to have a few races. A section with a care and insane detail and sensations at the controls that make us feel the speed of going at 300km / h from the living room of our house. Polyphony Digital has given his work a practical development and adaptable to all audiences.","Gran Turismo 7 is a gorgeous celebration of all things driving. It’s splendid presentation and 400 + car homage to the world’s favorite vehicles is a car lover’s dream. What it isn’t, however, is a true ‘real driving simulator.’ While easily a step up from GT Sport in offerings and presentation, those looking for an exhilarating gameplay experience will likely be disappointed.","Gran Turismo 7 is a love letter to motorsport history and an impeccable technical showcase. The franchise's traditional formula gets good improvements, but it's still extremely true to its roots. One of the best racing series ever shines spectacularly on the PS5.","When Polyphony Digital revealed that Gran Turismo 7 would be a great tribute to the franchise's 25 years, they weren't kidding. Even more than that, the game is a great ode to automobiles and presents a genuine desire to make every player become passionate about motorsport, providing a neat material for that. However, it's all about expectation. The game takes a long time to gear up to the truly challenging moments within the races, so if you don't want to deepen your knowledge about cars or contemplate the beauty of the automotive universe, Gran Turismo's historic glamor is likely to prove a burden.",,"Gran Turismo 7 on PlayStation 5 is really a great racing game - simply, because there is no competition. However, when looking at it from the racing genre's perspective, it lacks novelty and seems like a game which should have been released 5 years ago.","Gran Turismo 7 is an excellent racing simulator for those looking for a more realistic experience or to learn more about cars. There’s a ton of things to do, cars to collect, and tracks to master with the game’s great driving model. While you can feel the sheer passion the developers have for the subject, it does come with some flaws like very slow and tedious progression gates and persistent microtransaction prompts.","Gran Turismo 7 is a smorgasbord of esoteric ideas that create a more than solid racing title. The forced history lessons can break the flow of going in and out of races for some, while others might hate that there was so much hype around elements that feel superfluous since they don't affect the races. The campaign flow is excellent for those looking for granular structure, but others will hate how it locks some prominent modes for too long. The actual racing remains absolutely brilliant, however, to the point where some players will ignore the quirks because the act of playing is excellent enough for those of all skill levels to enjoy. For those who have waited this long for another mainline entry, Gran Turismo 7 is a grand reward for their patience.","Gran Turismo 7 isn't as revolutionary as its predecessors or certain competitors, and in some ways even comes across as needlessly narrow-minded. But the game is also incredibly beautiful to look at, wonderfully challenging in terms of car controls and full of love for everything on four wheels. This makes it not a modern classic, but a worthy top model.","Gran Turismo 7 can be recommended to everyone: to those who are looking for the ""must-play"" racing game, for real car lovers or even for those who are only going to use it to take car photos or have a nice dynamic car screensaver on Your tv. It's offer a bit more of the same, that's true, but in this context, what the game offers is enough to make it refreshing.","Gran Turismo 7 is a car-lover’s dream. Whether you love cars already or have just started your journey into being a car person, GT7 wants to welcome you to the community with open arms, get you up to speed and give you everything it can to help you enjoy cars in whatever ways it’s able. It has a wealth of car history to share, incredible feeling driving and some of the best visuals I’ve seen in a driving game. There are some cars I wish were included (Mount Panorama and no Aussie V8 Supercars? Come on, mate!) and the always online requirement might be a deal breaker for some, but even with all that Gran Turismo 7 is the friendliest, most approachable driving simulation I’ve played with all the depth of options you’d expect for seasoned car enthusiasts.",,"Gran Turismo 7 is an excellent racing game thanks to its huge scope, sublime driving physics and great technical implementation.",,"Gran Turismo 7 brings to the tracks every single thing fans always wanted: the GT Mode everyone loves, plenty of customization options, car loads, classic scenarios and one of the best DualSense and 3D Audio experiences the PS5 has to offer. This is the best Gran Turismo experience we have ever seen in a long time.","Gran Turismo 7 is a bit of a throwback to the genre’s early days — and includes some of the series’ old shortcomings — but when it comes to accurate driving physics and sheer, unadulterated love of cars, it’s something close to peerless.",,"Gran Turismo 7 is far from being the best racing sim out there, but it's a love letter to cars, and it shines in more ways than just pure racing. It's also about collecting and highlighting the beauty of cars. A must-have for every petrolhead.","I’m going to watch closely what happens with GT7 after the release, and I’ll be happy to hop back in once Polyphony Digital figures out the fans’ complaints and addresses them properly. Gran Turismo 7 has potential to become a truly great game one day, but it’ll require hard work from the devs.","Gran Turismo 7 is an interactive museum and encyclopedia where you can discover and learn a lot about cars. At the same time, it also provides you with an excellent racing experience thanks to the variety of cars, races, depth and more. The single player is worthwhile, online racing is cool and it is visually really enjoyable. Downside is that the AI sometimes doesn't take you into account and rallying is also very limited. And where is the damage model? These are some points to consider, but know that the gameplay itself in terms of racing is almost sublime and that makes this game compulsory for car enthusiasts.",,"Gran Turismo 7 is a game for everyone: the racing enthusiasts, the novices, and anyone in between. It celebrates car culture and history within the confines of a driving experience, explaining how the automobiles you race past the chequered flag fit into the wider world. There's never been a game quite like it before: Gran Turismo 7 means more than just racing. It's something that matters; something that warrants appreciation and respect just as much as it hands it out itself.","Gran Turismo 7 is one of those games that takes full advantage of the features of PlayStation 5. Loading times are minimal, audio design is impeccable and driving with the DualSense makes the gaming experience much more attractive. The menu design is too simple, but it is necessary for newer users to learn in a much more enjoyable way about motorsport culture.","Gran Turismo 7 keeps to old habits and doesn’t change very much, including graphics. Its automotive love will, however, send you careening back towards your childhood – you won’t stop until you collect every single beautiful car this game has to offer. And race with them, of course, because the driving model is joyous.","Despite my high expectations and some hiccups, Gran Turismo 7 surprised me positively. This is the most complete Gran Turismo ever, with beautiful graphics and presentation, masterful physics, a lot of content, a great single player and extensive multiplayer, and above all a lot of love for cars and motorsport.","Making full use of PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller to convey an incredibly deep and satisfying driving model, everything from weather to reflected sound effects have been modelled to perfection – making Gran Turismo 7 easily the world’s most complete driving game.","Gran Turismo 7 is a real return to the series' roots, one that fans have been waiting for. It brings together within it the multi and community aspect of GT Sport while rediscovering the ""RPG of the racing game"" aspect of the first four opuses with a well-structured and scalable GT mode. The driving is both technical and accessible, benefiting from great precision which offers a good margin of progress. 420 vehicles, 90 tracks on 34 circuits and mission and license modes for those who like small challenges, it promises a phenomenal lifespan to all car simulation fans. Although we would have appreciated a less plan-plan artificial intelligence, GT7 regains its acclaim to once again become The Complete Real Driving Simulator that we have always loved.","Polyphony has delivered an airtight flight from the everyday, rich in escape yet rooted in anything but fantasy.",,"Gran Turismo 7 hits that mark dead on with the sights, the sounds, the physics, and the animations of real-world driving and real-world racing.","After taking time to debate whether or not the game's very minor, and few, shortcomings are enough to make the game fall short, ultimately, they don't. Not only is this a return to form for an elite racing game series, but Gran Turismo 7 is as close as you'll get to the perfect driving game. Its sea of gameplay modes, beyond outstanding visuals, crisp sounds, and immersive use of PlayStation tech has given players an endlessly playable game that never gets dull. Polyphony Digital have crafted a must-play, must-own, masterpiece.","Gran Turismo 7 represents everything a car lover could wish for. Perfect details and motorsport history are the ingredients that make up this product; on the other hand, the game's formula is getting old and there’s the need for bigger changes than better graphics.","Gran Turismo 7 is a great driving-simulator that offers much more variety and content than previous outings of the series. With its gorgeous looking graphics, tons of options and enhanced online-options, it offers tons of replayability. It, however, isn’t perfect: In-game-transactions, overall presentation and bad AI mar the overall experience.","Gran Turismo 7 continues to go about its brand of racing simulation in a uniquely eccentric and elegant way. It looks and handles as great as ever, though there is not much novelty here to get excited about, and the always-online requirement remains unwarranted.","If Kazunori Yamauchi continues to be hermetic to the changes made in the genre since the competition stole the show from him, there is one thing that has not changed in him, it is his passion for the automobile. Everything in this episode oozes love for beautiful bodywork. If the game has been criticized for offering frozen scenery, in terms of car modeling, it is a delight at all levels, to the point of saying that we are turning into Carn Porn, especially when we are walking around in the Garage and the Photo mode. And then Gran Turismo 7 also reminds us how much the game is still fun to play, with this progression that only this series is able to provide. Yes, it's pretty austere in execution, but it's all rewarding knowing that you're moving pretty fast.",,"A purist’s driving game: nuanced, sophisticated and detailed. It’s imperfect, but crucially has the magic that’s been missing from the genre for decades. [Issue#13, p.72]","Gran Turismo 7 is the most complete game in the series, uniting its offline past with what was learned in GT Sport. The control with DualSense is amazing. [Recommended]","Nothing about GT7 is revolutionary, but the game feels like a GT title through and through, striking a careful gameplay balance with just the right amount of grinding. It's the kind of game that can turn a 30-minute session into a marathon before you know it, with a dose of comfortable familiarity thrown in for good measure...I'll be playing this one for quite some time.","It's a sumptuous, arrestingly gorgeous thing that most importantly retains its enthusiast's heart under the graphical showcase, and that does its level best to make a car enthusiast out of anyone in its orbit. Is it the king of driving games once more? The genre's now too broad and too varied to make such a statement, though Gran Turismo finds itself a neat slot alongside the likes of Assetto Corsa and iRacing, presenting accessible driving that looks simply staggering. Is it the best that Gran Turismo to date? Of that there's no real doubt. [Eurogamer Recommended]",,,,"If it’s ever tempting to think that Polyphony has been left behind by the times, we should remember that the Sport mode is its greatest achievement of the past decade, and that it remains without peer in its field. And if it seems striking that GT and its closest current mass-market competitor, Forza Horizon, now seem to be operating in different worlds — stylistically, philosophically, structurally — we should consider ourselves lucky to be able to enjoy two such distinctive approaches, both executed at the highest level. With GT7, Gran Turismo continues to be a glorious anomaly: a game made with different goals and to different standards than any other; a game made in service to a singular, individual vision; a game that’s all science and engineering on the outside, and all history and heart within.","Gran Turismo 7 is the quintessential Gran Turismo and the best of what the series has accrued over its 25 years of existence.

Kazunori Yamauchi has created a ""car city"" with plenty of game content and fun for the players. His love for car culture is reflected everywhere in the game.

As a driving experience, GT7 glides along fabulously – it’ll make a virtual petrolhead out of you.","Gran Turismo 7 is the prime example of a driving simulator. It doesn't offer too much in the way of sandbox options, because that is not why Polyphony created this franchise. Gran Turismo today serves the same purpose it served 25 years ago: showing that automobilism is an art form. It does so by incorporating the DualSense in the track experience and through the respect it shows for any of the cars we drive. From the heavy turning of a Fiat 500 to the incontrollable kicks of a Ford Mustang, Gran Turismo 7 is passion on wheels, this time with some neat content creation tools added.","You can, perhaps, reductively describe Gran Turismo 7 as 'GT Sport with a single-player component'. But seeing as that was all GT Sport needed to be an absolutely stellar racing game, this is a must-have for hardcore racing fans and the kind of game that is so good it might actually transform a few casual players into bonafide petrolheads themselves.",,"Mixing the original GT’s trendsetting format with GT Sport’s stern but very successful focus on competitive online racing, Gran Turismo 7 makes a few errors but is a potent podium performance from developer Polyphony Digital.","Gran Turismo 7 corrects the driving line of the legendary series and puts it back on the right track, hitting the apex on the essence of what Gran Turismo game should be like never before.

We also get a few new game modes, enhanced gameplay and in parts amazing graphics. Although the realistic environments can look a bit drab at times, and some races are a bit dull, Gran Turismo 7 is the most complete and unitary car game so far.",,"One of the biggest reasons to dive into the game is the visual fidelity, which is exceptional. The reflections on the ray-traced cars are something to behold, while the highly detailed circuits and accurate interiors create a sense of immersion that is well worth experiencing. Great sound design is tied to this immersion, as are the Dualsense features, putting the PS5 version some way ahead of its PS4 counterpart. Polyphony Digital has created a love-letter to long-time fans of the series as well as giving plenty of reasons for new players to jump in, and the game celebrates car culture to a degree that few games in this genre come close to.","A synthesis of classic GT and GT Sport, but still with the usual license flaws. GT7 remains a beautiful love letter to the motorsport history and a very good ""simarcade"".","Gran Turismo 7 certainly has its share of detriments and eccentricities, some of which are bound to bother some players much more than others. Yet, the parts that matter most are at the top of their class. The café guides players through the campaign in a way that feels fresh and fits the GT culture, the visuals can have you doing a double take, and all of it is in support of phenomenal next-level driving. Gran Turismo feels more welcoming and approachable than ever, without sacrificing its identity.",,"The presentation is a bit odd in 2022 and I would have liked to get ray-traced visuals in gameplay, but it doesn’t detract from the high you can get when shaving a few tenths on a flying lap at the Nordschleife. Sure, modern gamers may tell you that Nathan Drake or Aloy are the true mascots of the PlayStation brand, but Sony already had its Mario back in 1997 in the form of the Nissan R32 Skyline GT-R.","Gran Turismo 7 is the culmination of Polyphony’s 25 years of dedication to the racing genre and the automotive industry, and the final result is nothing short of outstanding, with only minor nuisances stopping it short of a perfect lap.","Gran Turismo 7 isn't a departure, but rather a newer, shinier GT game. Its physics model is accurate, and while the racing can be formulaic it's always a giggle. The attempt at humanity is a bit cringe,the lack of up-to-date cars seems like an open goal missed, and game may not have changed drastically, but that's not the worst thing in the world. There are medals to claim, cars to collect, and people on the internet to embarrass around Goodwood, the 'Ring, or, well, anywhere really. PlayStation petrolheads are in for a good time.","And that’s what GT7 reminds you of throughout your journey -- that this series has always held car and automobile culture as its anchor point, and in return has become a part of that culture itself. To some, there may be aspects of GT7 that feel static or sterile, but Polyphony Digital isn’t the fun uncle, it’s always been the serious one. And in Gran Turismo 7, what we get is a serious dose of incredible, be it from an historical and cultured perspective, or in learning how to just drive.","Gran Turismo 7 is the game that longtime fans of the series have been requesting for years. Although what's here isn't drastically different in format when compared to some of the earlier installments, the overall experience that Gran Turismo 7 provides is incredibly comprehensive and feels like a love letter to both car culture and the 25-year history of the Gran Turismo franchise.",,,,"Gran Turismo 7 is the ultimate driving simulator for car enthusiasts, but it’s also a brilliant introduction to the importance of car culture for automobile newcomers. Remarkably, thanks to its moreish, grounded structure and sticky progression, it’s easy to recommend to players who don’t even like cars. If you want something to test the limits of the PS5’s capabilities and you want to be educated about cars through a historic, passionate lens, then Gran Turismo 7 would be a great pick up. For series veterans, it will no doubt have years of support to come, but there’s plenty here in the base game to keep you busy for months. If only it didn’t have those sneaky microtransactions that feel completely at odds with the driving spirit of the game…","Gran Turismo 7 is a comprehensive racing simulator with features that will please series fans, those looking to learn about cars, and people who just want to race casually. While this simulator is more focused on making the player feel elegant rather than exhilarated, it sticks to its vision and highlights the power of the PS5.","For all its many quirks and oddities, there's a good chance you'll end up admiring Gran Turismo 7's steadfast idealism. Couple the quality of the driving experience – both mechanically and visually – with the sheer quantity of lovingly crafted stuff packed into this game, and you have the series’ finest entry since 2001’s Gran Turismo 3 way back on the PlayStation 2. Simply put: no other driving game feels as good as this one. If you don't love cars just yet, then this GT7 will do its damndest to make you a convert.",,,"I still remember getting the original PS1 release along with the just-launched DualShock controller for my birthday as a kid — it felt like a monumental advancement in racing games. Gran Turismo 7 is the most fun I’ve had with the series since that moment because it plays to its traditional strengths, improves those where it can, and ignores absolutely everything else.",,,"Gran Turismo 7 is an excellent game. It looks fantastic, with features like the photo and scapes modes, making the game look eerily photo-realistic. On the track, racing is top-notch. Every car feels unique; every change in the garage and every decision on the track matters. However, it doesn't mean there aren't issues. Always online requirements have failed me numerous times and lost progress when the servers have died; this is before launch. In addition to this, there's just a looming issue of time; the game doesn't value your time with the campaign (cafe menus), having it move at a glacially slow pace at best. Also, the soundtrack is atrocious. Still, whatever faults I find, they are far outweighed by overwhelming positives.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Whatever it is that draws you to Gran Turismo—the rags-to-riches solo campaign, online competition, collecting cars, automotive photography, technical accomplishment—Gran Turismo 7 goes above and beyond. It is, as it set out to be, the ultimate celebration of car culture, and I can think of no better way to commemorate the series' 25th anniversary.","Overall, Gran Turismo 7 is the greatest entry in the series to date and the perfect gateway game for those who are lapsed fans of the series. It takes everything the series has done right while cutting back greatly on things that have bogged it down over the years and outside of the lootboxes, feels like about as perfect an entry in the series as one could imagine. The completely restructured career mode makes for a far more fun and engaging experience and the menu overhaul makes everything so much easier to do. It looks great, plays near-perfectly, and is the exact kind of game I always wanted from the series. Simply put, Gran Turismo 7 is a must-buy for racing fans.","When servers are online and functional, Gran Turismo 7 is a triumph of the racing genre. There's a lot to love with its chilled out atmosphere in its campaign, a plethora of control options, and a vast number of cars to collect. Throw in impeccable production values and visuals, and you have one of the best racing games ever. Albeit one I can only recommend if you can stomach its always-online requirement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
guilty-gear--strive-,,,,,,,,,,"Guilty Gear -Strive- is an astonishing example of masterful visual fidelity, quality fighting gameplay and weird multiplayer design decisions. It comes with a not that great array of characters and some seriously slow server connection, but being the complete visual masterpiece and possessing one of the best gameplay the series has to offer, it is hard not to recommend it to any fighter or anime fan.",,,"Guilty Gear Strive is a simply stunning anime fighter with an astonishing depth of competitive gameplay. It does all it can to welcome newcomers with an extensive training mode and streamlined fighting mechanics, but it is still very much the beloved Guilty Gear niche experience, and rightly so. You can't have too much of a good thing, and Guilty Gear is certainly a good thing, so it's a slight shame that there isn't more content to sink our teeth into. Nevertheless, as a competitive fighting experience, it is still a fantastic entry that fans of the series will adore.",,,"Guilty Gear Strive is a hyperbolic exercise in style in the fighting genre, the next step in a path initiated by Arc System Works that combines form and substance to create a new instalment that reaffirms the strength of a saga that, despite being niche, is practically undeniable. Lucid to achieve that ""easy to play, difficult to master"", as precise as it is enjoyable in combat and concise in its proposal. A must for fans of the genre and a safe bet for anyone in the mood for great fights to the rhythm of good guitar playing.",,,,,"A great new entry for a cult classic. Guilty Gear Strive is one the most impressive games in terms of graphics that you can found out there. Also, it is a pretty solid fighting game.","What we have here is a prime example of how to do fighting games the right way. Guilty Gear -Strive- has enough for single players as well as the online crowd. It doesn’t just cater to the advanced player, but rather keeps a good balance whether you are an expert or just a beginner. Stunning to look at and listen to, and a total joy to actually play, Guilty Gear -Strive- is one that should not be missed. Even if you’ve never played a GG game before, you owe it to yourself to experience this title.",,,"It's a fast-paced and fun fighter with a colourful cast and some truly excellent tunes. It's easy to play it for hours online as an experienced fighting game player, or just blast it for 30 minutes with some friends over the weekend. It can be chaotic and unpredictable, but it's always gorgeous and engaging. Guilty Gear Strive is easily the best fighting game of 2021 so far, and there doesn't seem to be much on the horizon that can top it. If you're looking for a new fighting game to play this year, this is the easiest decision you'll ever make.",,"As I’ve said a few times in this review so far, Arc System Works are masters of the genre, and Guilty Gear Strive is a showcase of that mastery. It might not be the most comprehensive fighting game out there, and I do think the developers have made a mistake in giving up on drawing new players into the franchise with a story mode that assumes you’ve been playing Guilty Gear for years. However, those quibbles melt away the instant you get into the action itself. There’s no other word to describe it: it’s sublime.","Guilty Gear Strive is a fantastic entry to the series and to the genre itself. For long-time fans of the series, the story and gameplay will only reinforce the parts of Guilty Gear that have kept them playing and following along. For both those new to fighting games and seasoned veterans, Guilty Gear Strive presents a satisfying system that balances accessibility and mastery with care and confidence.",,,"Guilty Gear -Strive- becomes one of the best launches of 2021 and, at the same time, one of the biggest references for the fighting genre. Arc System Works delivers a new masterpiece that, despite some bad design choices, is as flawless as enjoyable, recommendable for newcomers to this style of games and for veterans that are used to combat titles.","The latest instalment of the Guilty Gear series is one of the most beautiful fighting games I’ve ever encountered and it plays great, partly thanks to the new wall break mechanic that lets you avoid being beaten to a pulp while trapped in a corner. What’s disappointing is the fact that we will have to wait a couple of months for the game to show its full potential with the addition of new characters and arenas, because right now its content is rather scant. [08/2021, p.56]",,"If I was looking for an on-ramp to understanding Guilty Gear or even one-on-one anime fighters, this is the game to do it with; and what’s here looks ready to act as a platform for more to come, as there will no doubt be balance changes and new characters to come. I can lament what it might be missing, but Guilty Gear Strive is also what I needed right now: a good, solid, very online-capable fighting game with plenty of big swords, charging dolphins, and doctors with questionable credentials to go around.",,,"Despite the intimidating amount of lore and extensive techniques needed to fully enjoy the story and combat, Guilty Gear -Strive- is a thoroughly enjoyable game.",,,"Guilty Gear -Strive- isn’t the most generous fighting game available when it comes to content, but its wonderfully energetic combat makes up for it. Its characters are larger than life, each bringing something new to the table that’s worth exploring before settling on perhaps one or two to truly master. And while it’s the easiest Guilty Gear game to simply pick up and play, there’s a hell of a lot of depth to be discovered by those who wish to compete at a high level. Thanks to brilliant netcode, it’s likely that a lot of fighting game fans will, too. The flashy visuals and rocking soundtrack are a couple of cherries on top.",,,,,,"One of the most spectacular fighting games ever made, with game dynamics that may appeal to any player... Although its main focus is online gaming. It may feel a little too shallow in content.","Guilty Gear Strive is a masterclass in design. Each asset has been lovingly crafted with painstaking detail resulting in the best visuals in the genre. The lack of gameplay in the story mode may not appeal to everyone but I applaud their decision to not shoehorn fights into the narrative. Being the most accessible game in the history of the franchise, newcomers should definitely check out this fighter as it’s one of the best ever made.",,,,,,,"Guilty Gear -Strive- is an excellent fighting game with gorgeous visuals, but feels like it's lacking in content. There are essentially only three modes of play, arcade, survival, and online. While the complex inputs and lack of a decent tutorial will leave some players in the dust, fighting feels so good you won’t want to put the controller down.","Guilty Gear Strive continues the series' legacy as a flashy fighter with loads of depth, but it also does its best to shed the idea that it's inaccessible. The tweaks and new mechanics make for a fighter that's still a blast to play, and the upgraded presentation, along with the fast load times for the PS5 iteration, make it eye-catching. Provided you don't mind the online lobby system, Strive is an excellent fighting game. Just make sure to keep it patched if you want a decent offline experience.",,,,,,"Guilty Gear -Strive- rocked my socks off with its gorgeous visuals, kick-ass music, and tight fighting gameplay. I can't wait until it releases so I can spend hours beating up all sorts of folks in its impressive online multiplayer mode.",,,,"Guilty Gear Strive is a great fighting game, visually stunning and incredibly satisfying to play, but the lack of content can be painful.","Guilty Gear has always been a stylized series, but it’s a fighting game with a lot of depth that rewards those who practice and learn all of its unique quirks and techniques. Strive makes some smart changes that simplify some past techniques without sacrificing the soul of what makes it so much fun to play. Serious fighting game fans will appreciate its complexity and promising netcode, and everyone else will enjoy its vivid cast and rewarding, flashy combo system.","If you can overlook the long waiting times when trying to connect to online servers, Guilty Gear - Strive is the place to be for any fighter fan. It's a truly amazing experience, both on- and offline, with an interesting story and wonderful graphics to boot. Absolutely worth your money.",,"Guilty Gear Strive is a different kind of Guilty Gear. Veteran players may not appreciate some of the changes, but there's no denying that this is still an exceptional fighting game. On a mechanical level, Strive is immensely satisfying and hugely rewarding. On a visual level, it's quite simply unmatched in its genre, and the same can be said of its outstanding online netcode. Where it matters, Strive is a borderline masterpiece.",,,,"One of the best looking video games ever made and the most accessible Guilty Gear has ever been, with impressively deep combat and memorable characters.","The title remains a good vent, sublimated by an artistic direction of thunder.",,,,,Guilty Gear Strive is quite possibly one of the best fighting games of the last decade.

Accessible, incredible deep and espectacular, Strive is a must-have for 2D fighting fans.",Guilty Gear Strive pushes the fighting game genre into the next generation with immense style and engrossing gameplay.,"Guilty Gear -Strive- excels in all the areas you’d expect it to – the music is sick, the characters look crazy, the fighting is fun, and May players deserve nothing. It’s an old dog that's been taught new tricks, and all of those tricks are rad as hell. At the same time, it feels like it can be so much more. The story mode is clunky and the Online Mode can use some work, but I’m sure as post-launch support ramps up we’ll see stellar improvements to both those fronts.","Guilty Gear -Strive- is the premier fighting game for the next generation of gaming. At launch, the experience feels complete with an in-depth single-player, robust multiplayer, and plenty of great extras. It has, without a doubt, the best 2.5D graphics featuring unreal fluidity in its animation. The gameplay is superbly refined and engaging, featuring a roster of imaginative characters with uniquely contrasting fighting styles. What once was an obscure fighting game has now become a genre leader, like a small-town rock band selling out stadiums.",,,"Guilty Gear Strive is a beautiful, technically complex fighter that sports a great soundtrack, incredibly varied roster, fantastic teaching tools, and some of the best netcode in the genre all while making Guilty Gear more accessible without sacrificing too much of its technical depth. While its online lobbies need work, it's easily one of the best fighters on the market today. Go buy it and start rockin'.","For a PS5 owner desperate for a 2D fighter to add to their collection, this is a no brainer. With a long history of 2D fighters in this reviewer's back catalogue Guilty Gear Strive has gained a place in the top tier pantheon of the genre. Fantastic graphics, excellent gameplay that has the perfect balance of easy to pick up, difficult to master and some real thought put into the obligatory online mode mean it is likely to remain unbeaten for a long time to come. Maybe until the next entry in the series is released. Brilliant Brawling.",,,Guilty Gear Strive is the best looking fighting game in a long time and its captivating and layered gameplay is absolutely engaging.,,,,,,,,,,"Guilty Gear Strive is a milestone 2D fighting game that raises the bar for anime-like fighters in terms of its visuals, online netcode, and sheer creativity found in all aspects of its design. It’s definitely a different flavor of Guilty Gear, with a heavier focus on fighting in the neutral and a slightly slowed down pace, but it maintains the series soul with absolutely wild character designs, flexible combo system, and a level of creativity both in its presentation and mechanics that is second to none in the genre.",,,"In all, Guilty Gear Strive is an incredible game, one that I strongly recommend fighter fans get as soon as possible, there really is no reason at all not to.",,,,,,,Strive is a mechanically sophisticated 2D fighting game with sensational presentation and beautiful visuals - and one very costly problem with time-consuming server communication.,,,,,"With Guilty Gear -Strive-, Arc System Works has found a formula to make accessibility and depth coexist. The characters are memorable and the game mechanics guarantee always varied games, despite more limited move lists and combo routes than in the past.","Noting Strive was difficult, because it really depends on what you expect from the game. If you're a FGC veteran, or a beginner who plans on investing time for discovering fighting games, Strive is a masterpiece. Beautiful game with rock/metal songs, GGST will give you all the keys to become the best fighter in the world, thanks to his amazing tutorials and rollback netcode. But if you just plan on playing offline, just in the solo mode, you should avoid it, because that is not where Strive shines. And if you just want a fighting game to play with friends at home from time to time, well you can give it a shot because the characters are really cool, and you'll have a lot of fun.",,,,,"Guilty Gear Strive is arguably the best 2D competitive fighting game available, but the content at launch is likely to be divisive. Online gamers will love the highly acclaimed Rollback, while solo players might find the singleplayer offer to be inadequate.",,,"If you’re new to the Guilty Gear series, there isn’t a better place to start than -Strive-. If you’re a returning veteran, enough has changed to keep things feeling fresh, but I have a feeling you’ll be up to speed in no time. While definitely complex and at times a bit intimidating, it does a fantastic job of initiating players. Guilty Gear -Strive- never holds back. If you remotely enjoy fighting games, this is a stunner you shouldn’t miss.",,,"Guilty Gear -Strive- is a great starting point for newcomers to the series. In addition to great gameplay, it also offers a visual and auditory feast.",,,"While Guilty Gear Strive definitely has shortcomings to consider, they feel almost insignificant when tallying up everything the game does so well. It’s not just another Guilty Gear, but instead a defining moment for the series. In a lot of ways, it's so far ahead of its peers in terms of online functionality and accessibility, two areas the genre fails in time and again. If you've been too intimidated to seriously get into fighting games, it's hard to think of a better game than Strive. If you're a battle hardened veteran, there's no reason to wait. Jump in and start shredding. You'll lose countless hours in the blink of an eye.",,"Guilty Gear Strive is a whole new level of beast.

And that's what matters most. Like all Guilty Gears, it is a game of extremes. If you've tried the series and fallen off because of its complexities, I wouldn't expect a different outcome.

It’s more accessible than ever and absolutely stunning to watch. There’s still room for improvement in terms of the single-player modes, and the whole retro online matching setup is quaint but just adds unnecessary complication to the multiplayer. Otherwise, this is a solid fighting game worth playing.",,"Arc System Works have put together an attractive blend of “easy to learn, difficult to master” mechanics, with all the tutorials you could possibly need to improve your skills. The pace is not quite as blistering as previous titles, and series stalwarts may find the streamlining too much to bear, but Strive shows real potential for depth of personal expression. With many changes aimed at attracting new players, Strive is looking to build its fanbase whilst still giving plenty for veterans of the series to get their teeth into. But can it have its cake and eat it? Will newcomers keen to learn feel encouraged to hang around once they hit their personal plateau? Conversely, will pro players and content creators find enough here to keep them entertained beyond the first few months?

Its online matchmaking may still need some work before it's ready for the main event, but Arc System Works has delivered a captivating display of coolness and action.",,,,,,"Ever since its announcement, there have been concerns about Guilty Gear Strive and the new direction it’s going: concerns that it would try too hard to make the game approachable at the cost of depth, that it would oversimplify things, that it’d lose what makes Guilty Gear Guilty Gear. And sure, Strive is a different beast, with a different tempo and a different focus, but it’s still got all the quintessential pieces of Guilty Gear in place: the tactical depth, the interplay between systems that creates fascinating strategic opportunities, the rich characters, the hype, the big juicy combos. It’s a little lacking in bells and whistles and the lobby system leaves a lot to be desired, but the core of the game is rock solid—and, really, that’s what’s most important.",,"Guilty Gear Strive is an absolutely incredible fighting game with its gorgeous visuals, sublime gameplay, kickass soundtrack, and robust online play.",,,,,,"Guilty Gear -Strive- sets a new gold standard for fighting games.

uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection,,,,,,,"After about 5 years, Uncharted is still impressive, and with one of a kind gameplay and improved visuals and frame rate, it’s a must have package for those who never played Uncharted 4 or The Lost Legacy before. As for those who already beat both games, paying another 50 bucks for pretty much the same games doesn’t seem a good value for money.",,"This collection is the best and, in my opinion, only way you should experience Uncharted 4 and Uncharted The Lost Legacy. The enhancements are more than solid, and the jump from 30 to 60 (and even 120) FPS finally give it the edge it so desperately deserved.","Legacy of Thieves is a minor, yet noticeable visual upgrade, that mostly ravishes itself in its unlocked 60 FPS and 120 FPS modes. These are the best ways to experience Drake's final journey, especially in 60 FPS, with its clarity, reflections and shadow resolution still being a notch above the previous version with the smoothest experience so far. It still isn’t enough for new fans to put out full price, as previous owners of only one of the two titles will profit the most, getting the two games for the price of one.","There’s no doubting the quality on offer here, then, but if you already own the PS4 versions then you might struggle to justify the outlay for the upgrades on offer – particularly when the original iteration of A Thief’s End is also available to PS5 owners with an online subscription for free as part of the PlayStation Plus Collection. One gets the sense it’s the kind of buying decision consumers will need to get used to making over the course of the coming console generation.",,"Whether you're experiencing these stunning games for the first time or are returning for another playthrough, emboldened by the technical facelift that the PlayStation 5 provides, Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection brings together two absolute banner PlayStation exclusives into a delectable and unmissable package that serves as a timely reminder that Nathan Drake and company have been long missed.",,"Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is of great value for those who didn't play the original games, but for those who did the enhanced PS5 conversion is still similar to the originals, which could be all you are asking for.",,,"Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection has several improvements, but probably isn't enough for those who already played it. Anyway, two games that are still on the top of third-person adventures.",,"If you’ve never played Uncharted before, this is as five-out-of-five a game as you’ll ever see in review...Grab this for £42.99 and set aside February for nothing else.",Sony is delivering just what was promised. No more no less. It will be up to each person to decide whether to support or not.,"So if you’ve never played one, or perhaps both games, then I think this collection is a no-brainer for sure. And even if you have, the upgrade discount path makes this collection a worthy addition to your growing PS5 library, and it’s sure to be the game that you pop up in when you’re trying to show off modern console technology to your friends and family. It’s a solid remaster of two excellent games, both of which are well worth playing through again.","Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is a fantastic collection that greatly enhances two top-tier games. The lack of multiplayer is disappointing, but it's hardly a deal-breaker. And after seeing how great Uncharted looks and plays on PS5, fans will be clamoring for a proper Uncharted sequel built for the ground-up for the platform.","Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is a must-have for anyone that has yet to play these two games or simply wants to revisit them. Oh, if you have savegames from either of these titles on your PS4, Sony provides an easy way to migrate those onto your PS5, by the way. But whether you’re revisiting these games or just playing them for the first time, you’re in for a treat. Naughty Dog have proven themselves as one of the best studios in the business, and these two games do not disappoint. Add this release to the ever-growing list of superb PlayStation-exclusive titles that you can’t miss.","The Legacy of Thieves Collection compiles the two finest games in the Uncharted series while making them look and feel better than ever before. Yet they already pushed boundaries that are yet to be usurped, meaning existing owners of this game need to shell out for a relatively minimal upgrade without too much to offer. I still think it’s more than worthwhile just to relive these adventures once again, but part of me wishes a little more effort was placed into bringing them to life for a new generation.",,"Which brings me back to that question: what is the point of Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, really? Sure, Lost Legacy is a wildly enjoyable adventure in classic Uncharted style, and even Uncharted 4, for all my complaints about it, is a game a lot of people clearly loved, and they'll love it again here. But when the only thing these ""remasters"" have over the PS4 originals that you can already play on PS5 are modest technical upgrades whose practical and aesthetic improvements are marginal at best, what purpose do they actually serve? When even someone who's never played either game before and is breaking in their brand new console and can get an identical experience for half the price by just buying the existing PS4 bundle, what is this Legacy of Thieves Collection other than a half-step in a pointless technical arms race and a chance to cynically sell some unnecessary version upgrades? We would all be served better if Sony focused on bringing us some of the incredible games that aren't readily available on the console already.","Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection is authentic, exciting, and well worth exploring, neatly tying together the series past and potential future in the best version of both to date.",The new Uncharted collection shows that the series still has a lot to offer. The new PS5 features are just the icing on the cake.,"Both Uncharted 4 and Uncharted Lost Legacy are still fantastic games that deserve a second playthrough on PlayStation 5. Naughty Dog’s first outing on the PlayStation 5 is an incredibly strong one, and only makes me even more excited for what it has coming next, and what they’ll be able to do with this technology.","Uncharted: Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is the definitive edition of two games that remind me that Naughty Dog are experts at creating great adventures. Now I have no doubt whatsoever, the legacy of Nathan Drake is eternal.","Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection has everything I expect from a game inspired by exhilarating adventure movies in the vein of the Indiana Jones franchise. Naughty Dog, the grandmasters of enrapturing details, effortlessly prove how much you can squeeze out of this seemingly worn out formula. If there’s anything to complain about, it’s the small number of changes introduced in the remastered versions. On the other hand, do these still exceptional and visually stunning games need changes?","Uncharted nails the cinematic adventure so well, and it’s great to see the two campaigns looking as crisp as they do on the screen.","Given that these are single-player experiences first, it makes sense that there wouldn't be a focus on bringing in multiplayer.","While I’m disappointed by the relatively simple execution of this remaster, the content offered here is still outstanding. From overall presentation to the polished gameplay, this is still single-player gaming at its finest, now made shinier. It’s an easy flex for PS5, but that doesn’t make it any less of a must-play for those who missed out on the last-gen launch or hardcore fans who want to scrutinize every pore on Nate and friends’ higher-resolution faces.","Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is worth its price-tag, offering a gorgeous games with high resolution and nice performance boost.",,,,"No doubt some will have expected more of a visual overhaul, but it's hard to find fault with Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection. Both Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and The Lost Legacy still look stunning, and thanks to better frame rates and other PS5-centric features they are more immersive and fun to play than ever before. If you own one or both of these games on PS4 and are considering playing them again, it's well worth upgrading. And if you've never played them? Well, you'd be mad to let the opportunity pass you by again if you own a PS5.","The Uncharted series have always been at the forefront of the action-adventure genre. The Legacy of Thieves Collection is undoubtedly the definitive way to play through the last two chapters of this long running series, with lightning fast load times, excellent visuals, boosted frame rates, and immersive utilization of the DualSense controller and 3D audio. Don't skip out on this narrative masterpiece!","If you’ve never played an Uncharted game before and want to see what all the fuss is about, Legacy Of Thieves Collection is a must-play. Whether you’re coming to it on PC or PS5, both games serve as a reminder that nobody does gripping, story-driven action-adventure quite like Naughty Dog. If you are a veteran of the series, these welcome upgrades add an extra shine to an already gleaming treasure.","Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is a masterpiece, with both games receiving impressive improvements. Better visuals, faster load times, and DualSense integration, two wonderful titles have been made even better.","Given that Uncharted 4 is already available on PlayStation 5 as part of a wee free collection of PlayStation classics for all PlayStation Plus subscribers, it’s hard to argue that this is an essential purchase for anyone who’s played these games before. If they passed you by at the time, though, this is the best way to experience two different spins on the same bombastic action game – adventures that remind us why characters such as Nathan Drake (and his spiritual predecessor Lara Croft) suit video games so well.","Two of the latest Uncharted games were brought to the PS5 (and later PC) with graphical improvements and DualSense support. Playing these games in 4K with HDR is a marvel. Sony has also finally figured out how to easily incorporate progress from the PS4 versions. However, the price structure is a mess and Sony really should sort that out, especially when the competition has made that so easy.","Legacy of Thieves Collection brings back two extraordinary adventure games, with 4K resolution and up to 120 FPS in performance + mode. It is a must for newcomers, but if you already played PS4 versions, this remaster feels too short. There is no extra content and visual upgrade is not enough to buy them again.","Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and The Lost Legacy are unassailably great. In particular, Uncharted 4 is a pinnacle of both the art and technology of games, and the Lost Legacy isn't far behind. The Legacy of Thieves Collection is the hands-down, must-have version for any PS5 owner who has, inconceivably, never touched these classic games. For owners of the PS4 version, already playing it on PS5, ""buy now"" comes with a few very mild caveats. For one, the upgrades are primarily in support of higher resolutions or better framerates, and while the games look stunning in native 4K, you're not getting a ton more for your ten bones. Given the lack of extras, this should maybe have been a freebie for owners of the PS4 version. On the other hand, if this collection's reasonable price prompts you into playing these masterpieces again, that's absolutely a win for you.","Two essential games that you can relive with Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves; or experience them for the first time if you missed them back in the day. Its graphical improvements focus mainly on refresh rate performance, providing an optimal experience. Any excuse is good to put on the explorer's suit and jump into impossible jumps or to solve puzzles in mysterious catacombs.","The gaming gods of Naughty Dog have spoken in Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection and wow, what a ride on the PS5!",,,,,"Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection brings two of the PlayStation 4’s best games to current gen consoles in brilliant remasters that would fool even the pickiest of gamers into believing these games were native made for the PlayStation 5. Packed full of adventure, heart, incredible storytelling, fantastic visuals, and believable characters, the Legacy of Thieves collections shows why Naughty Dog is one of the undisputed champions of the medium.","Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is a no-frills, straight-to-PS5 port that checks all of the required boxes, and that's about it. A couple of performance modes support up to 120fps, there's a rudimentary DualSense implementation, and the great loading times make experiencing these games more enjoyable than ever, but it's hardly a phenomenal upgrade even at the lower price point — both for those upgrading from a PS4 copy and those buying into the franchise for the first time. While the Uncharted gameplay formula has become slightly predictable, both Uncharted 4 and The Lost Legacy are enjoyable because of the stories they tell and their highly polished production values.","With minimal improvements, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection makes the most of two wonderful games.","A great opportunity for those who missed this series as well as for those who want to see it at its best, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection does not surprise or disappoint, but manages to thrill gamers just as it did 6 years ago.","Whilst the price is a little steep, I can't deny the fact that the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection provides the best way to play two of PlayStation's best games. Naughty Dog's finest shine on the PS5 hardware and if you haven't played these games, you're in for an absolute treat, and if you're returning to these games, you can expect to be blown away all over again, if not for the enhanced visuals alone.",,,Fans wanting an excuse to re-play the two most recent Uncharted titles on a current-gen console finally have incentive to do so. The breathtaking scenery looks awesome on PS5 and I thoroughly enjoyed playing through these memorable adventures again.,"If you were dying to see Nathan Drake in action again, you’re going to get it. UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection is a blessing. Uncharted 4 and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy look stunning on the PS5, and their gameplay are just as good, reassuring that both games were ahead of their times and aged like fine wine.",,,,,,,"Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection bundles together two of the PS4's greatest games. Both Uncharted 4 and The Lost Legacy remain brilliantly crafted thrill rides, and their blend of cinematic action is still best-in-class. Throw in improved performance on PS5, and you've got a remarkably high quality package that's incredibly easy to recommend. If it's been a few years since you played either of these titles, the upgrade is probably worth the £10 / $10 asking price. If you're brand new, you're in for a treat — but you might want to start with Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection.","Uncharted: The Legacy of Thieves Collection proves that Naughty Dog doesn't just create solid gaming experiences with incredible cutscenes and deep, detailed environments. The study that also delivered The Last of Us: Part II shows us that it knows how to adapt its games to the new hardware available and that the results will always be outstanding.","Both games this remaster aims to upgrade haven’t really aged at all, at least gameplay-wise. They are still epic, still a bit silly, still beautiful and still charming thanks to their characters. Now everything is just a bit more stunning, sharper, smoother and overall more enjoyable owing to the amazing DualSense.",,Uncharted 4 is one of the best action adventure games ever made but this remaster does so little to improve the experience it doesn’t feel like anything other than a cynical cash grab.,"Both remain the excellent action/adventure games they were at the time, still offering spectacular moments and more touching sequences, in the service of fast-paced experiences that are still savored with great pleasure. That being said, the performance boost offered by the PS5 remains quite anecdotal, and, unless you are an ultimate aficionado of the franchise and the frames per second are a grail to reach to play your favorite license, the investment remains dispensable, all the more so since the 4K / 30 FPS sometimes struggles to hold up. That being said, the performance mode does its job very well and ensures 60 fps in optimal conditions thanks to an effective upscaling technique. So, if you want to discover for the first time the adventures of Chloé Frazer and Nathan Drake, or if you want to play this license in a more fluid way, this collection remains pleasant enough to browse for you to consider acquiring it.",,,,,"Nathan, Chloe and their sidekicks are back on the PS5. Their single-player adventures are still entertaining and now they have shorter loading times, shiny textures, three visual modes and some of that DualSense/Tempest sorcery.","Better graphics, great 3D sound, nice Dual Sense optimizations and noticeably improved loading times - the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is currently the technically best way to again enjoy ""Uncharted 4"" and ""Uncharted: The Lost Legacy"". It’s just a shame that the multiplayer complex wasn’t remastered too, that the developers did not add any new content extras and that the upgrade concept does not work out for everyone.",,"On paper, Uncharted Legacy of Thieves Collection has some nice arguments to be tempted, but of remaster, there is really only the name, since the two titles have not really been reworked at the source. We are rather dealing with a plus-plus port to which we have added the performance of the PS5. Save your money for Horizon 2 Forbidden West, that's a better choice.","Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection offers up two amazing games that have aged gracefully, helping them to shine better than ever before. Newcomers are in for a treat, though returning players have little reason to rush out and buy it again.","A seriously impressive remaster of two blockbusters that rank among the finest of the PS4 era, and a must-play for both fans and newcomers. [Issue#11, p.86]","Uncharted Legacy of Thieves Collection is a somewhat basic remaster with few improvements beyond 60 frames per second and 3D sound, but it is an opportunity to vindicate one of the greatest games of the last generation.",,"I can't help but feel that Naughty Dog could have unlocked the frame-rate on the existing PS4 Pro code and delivered a locked 1440p60 experience - in the way that the studio's PS5 patch for The Last of Us Part 2 worked - and much of the audience would have been perfectly content with that. However, the $10 upgrade does give you multiple modes, enhanced visuals and far better loading. And as a collector of physical media, I'm happy that we now have a complete version of both of these games, fully patched up and enhanced - it's basically an archive version of Uncharted 4 and The Lost Legacy, which I greatly appreciate. It's not unlike buying a deluxe 4K UHD Blu-Ray movie of a film you had on normal BD. I really enjoyed returning to these games and look forward to seeing how these upgrades scale when the remastered collection hits PC some time in the future.",,,"If you’ve never tried the series before, the remastered collection is a great excuse to jump in.","Both newcomers and longtime fans will find a lot to appreciate in Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, although they won’t find the original games’ serviceable multiplayer component (an omission I don’t mind one bit). This is the definitive way — at least until the PC release, which will presumably support 4K at 60 fps — to play a pair of beloved games that are two of the best at what they do. The package’s upgrades might seem perfunctory on paper, but as ever, the play’s the thing. [Polygon Recommends]","This is the best these two games have ever played, and for those who haven’t played the titles before or returning players who can take advantage of the $10 upgrade, it’s the best way to play them. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection might not be the shiniest of Sony’s remastered treasures, but it’s a treasure nonetheless.","Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection does little to improve on the series' gameplay, but the visual facelift is more than enough of a reason to give these two genre greats another go.","This is just a decent remaster of two incredible games that lacks some ambition. The games, of course, are still as fantastic as they were when they were first released.","Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is a solid remaster of two excellent games, even if it’s hard to deny the desire for the entire collection in one package.","Long after Nathan Drake hung up his holster for the last time a half decade ago, Uncharted’s legacy still remains. This collection crams two genre-defining prestige hits together - the kind of linear AAA action games we rarely see today. Let’s hope for more treasure-hunting adventures to come.",,"Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is the combination of the best two installments of the Uncharted franchise. The powerful performance of PS5 pushes the game graphics to the next level, and the whole gaming process is nothing less than ""amazing"". However, almost none of the features of the game, including the adaptive trigger and the useful ""shock"" function, gives full play to the performance of the DualSense gamepad, and consequently the game controls cannot make the game more immersive, which is quite regrettable.",,Nathan Drake and Chloe Frazer's action-packed adventures are still an absolute blast.,,"Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is a must-have package for anyone yet to grapple with Nathan Drake's latest adventure and expansion starring Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross. The 60 FPS mode on PS5 stands as the best way to enjoy these experiences, so much so that even those who have already completed them could be strongly tempted to get the upgrade.",,,,"Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and The Lost Legacy are two unmissable experiences for PlayStation players. They're huge, bombastic, and rich stories that go toe to toe with some of the biggest Hollywood blockbusters around – and with their upgraded graphics it's hard not to say this collection is worth a look. If you've yet to play either game, this is a must-buy. Ultimately, however, these are a fairly barebones repackaging. So if you've already experienced both games, the high price tag might not be such an easy sell.",,,Uncharted 4 remains to this day one of the best (if not the best) cinematic action-adventure games of all time and The Lost Legacy -though not as great- is a decent adventure. Both games aged remarkably well and look as beautiful today as the day of their initial launch. On top of that we have some major upgrades on the resolution and the frame rate that make them a must-have collection especially for those you haven't played them before.,,"It’s hard to say anything against not one but two Uncharted games in a single volume, specially if they have been visually and technically enhanced by the capabilities of Sony’s new console. This collection is mainly directed at those who never played the games, although veterans will still take pleasure in revisiting the protagonists on the PS5 before going to the movies and see Tom Holland but of course, the console has many colossus coming already in the beginning of the year and not all pockets are deep enough for every possibility.",,,,"While God of War and The Last of Us 2 only got a patch that allowed them to work better on PlayStation 5, the last two Uncharted titles get a little more love with special remasters that bring many new graphical options and great support for other gimmicks of the new system. In the newly remastered collection Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy both look fantastic just like we remember them, and are definitely still a must-play for all, as well for the fans who just want to be reminded of these titles in the best possible way.",,"Both titles were exceptional in the respective years of release, and in the Legacy of Thieves Collection, both Uncharted 4, and The Lost Legacy are the best they’ve ever been.","Despite those small things, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection blew me away on the PS5. The breathtaking landscapes and fluid gameplay heighted by the addition of improved feedback from the DualSense controller took a fantastic experience to another level.",,"How much do you want to replay Uncharted 4 and The Lost Legacy? That's the question you've got to ask yourself right now. If your gaming docket is looking pretty rammed, then this is one you can probably pass on for the time being.

It's the definitive way to experience these PS4 masterpieces, and has me dreaming about the possibilities of a true PS5 Uncharted title.",,"Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection joins the Nathan Drake Collection as the best way to experience some of the greatest titles PlayStation has ever put out into the world. Naughty Dog truly are kings of their craft, having created many of the industry's greatest games, and with Uncharted established a franchise that captures the movie-like-magic of adventure cinema and brings it into the interactive space. Who knows what the future of the Uncharted franchise has in store, but for now getting your hands on this collection is a sure-fire way to experience a platform-defining experience that should hold up for years to come.",,,,,,"Uncharted 4 and The Lost Legacy look better than ever. Playing them at 60 frames per second is a treat and the basic implementation of the DualSense haptics On the other hand, these details are perhaps insufficient to justify another ride through the world of Uncharted.

Uncharted 4 was already a fantastic game in the first place thanks to the combination of top-notch direction, solid gameplay and masterful storytelling, with characters that are both believable and engaging. This new version allows you to experience all this with the same comfort and the same level of immersion as the other PS5 games or almost.",,,"Even if you’ve played through Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy before, I’d recommend returning to them for this collection. Playing at a higher frame rate won’t completely transform these games, but it certainly makes them more enjoyable. After five years with nothing new in the world of Uncharted, now is a better time than ever to jump back in.","The Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is every bit as good as the individual games were upon their original release. This remastered collection shows exactly why the Uncharted series was and is so highly regarded, even 6 and 5 years later, respectively.","Nathan Drake and Chloe Frazer are back with their single-player adventures, polished and enhanced to suit the power of PS5. They're still fresh, enjoyable and now feature shorter loading times, three graphic modes and a little bit of DualSense magic.",,,,"The bundled games are undeniably great, their enhancements solid -- but nonetheless, these are old titles pulled off the shelf and given a fresh coat of varnish, and at an additional cost to those who've already purchased them at that.",,"Uncharted Legacy of Thieves is a nice package that makes good use of the features of Playstation 5, with the visual and technical improvements it offers in both games in the collection.","Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves is by far the smoothest way to play these two Naughty Dog titles. However, the upgrades are fairly light overall.",,,,,"While it's not overly surprising to see PlayStation migrate two of its biggest last gen titles to the PS5 and slap a new entry fee on the front, it's also not an overly exciting end product. There's merit in playing these beloved and bombastic blockbuster hits in an eye-searing new fidelity but the weight of this package isn't quite worth the gold.","There's no question then that you are getting a vastly superior way to play both of the PlayStation 4's Uncharted entries, afforded by the more powerful hardware of the new generation of consoles. The upgrades are in line with what many other games from other publishers are putting out for free for players, but the upgrade structure here does allow you to grab both games for a small fee even if you only own one. That softens the blow somewhat, but it's a factor to consider if you've already experienced both games, with Uncharted 4 faring worse with its extremely slow opening when played through again. These are still both exceptional games, made better by more powerful hardware, making it an easy recommendation if you've missed them over the years.",,"If you played and enjoyed Uncharted 4: A Thief's End or Uncharted: The Lost Legacy years ago because you enjoy the feeling of climbing wild structures and unearthing treasure, the good news is that's all still here in Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection. If you played those two video games previously because the series is known for stunning locations and exotic locales, neither has ever looked better than in the new PS5 remasters. If you want something entirely new, well, this isn't that, but it also doesn't pretend to be.

monster-hunter-rise,,,,,,,,,,"MH: Rise is an excellent addition to the franchise, and it worked flawlessly as one of the best Nintendo Switch titles. This next-gen port lives up to the expectations and provides great new gameplay inclusions and mechanics.

However, the removal of tutorials, and an overabundance of systems means the game isn’t as approachable as it could be.",,,,,,,,"While there’s been no content added to either the PlayStation or Xbox versions, you’ll still have plenty to do here. There’s the main questline to engage with that’ll take you through multiple monster quest tiers, which is somewhat short compared to other Monster Hunter titles. But the online hub quests expand that out even further, offering up more story content that goes beyond the end credits of the game, and has a number of challenging fights for experienced hunters. There’s also a whole host of free downloadable quests to engage with, encompassing the free DLC that’s come out on prior versions of the game. All in all, you’ll be able to spend a lot of time exploring and hunting down giant monsters, which is pretty much what you want out of a new Monster Hunter game.","Monster Hunter Rise is an absolute joy to play regardless of the platform chosen. Console players who do not have a Switch and have been eagerly awaiting this port can finally rejoice because they now have the opportunity to try out this wonderful game. The gameplay improvements found here can make it difficult to go back to World and while it does not have the same overall graphical quality as that game, this newest version is an absolute blast to play and was well worth the wait.","Capcom’s Monster Hunter Rise is an entertaining game. It has enough depth, action, and crafting to keep you and your team occupied for a while. It’s not perfect in some respects, but it’s good enough when you’re looking for a team-based game that is more coop than not.",,,,"Regardless of which version is played, though, the same thing holds true in 2023 that was evident a few years ago: Monster Hunter Rise is an excellent, massive game, and should be experienced by anyone with even a slight fondness for action-RPGs or monster hunting genres.",,,,,,,,,,,,"So, should you buy Monster Hunter Rise on PS5? The answer is a resounding yes if you’ve not played it before. Providing you don’t mind too much that you can’t carry your progress over, you might want to jump in for a variety of reasons even if you’ve played the game on Switch or PC, too. While the Sunbreak expansion isn’t included, there’s still a hell of a lot of game here. And with its wealth of new gameplay features over previous entries in the series, PS5-centric enhancements and faster-paced gameplay, this is undoubtedly the best Monster Hunter game yet.","Monster Hunter Rise distills the fun of boss fights into an entire game, and it excels at doing so. While it is good in single-player, the best experience is found online playing with fellow hunters. Despite not adequately holding the player's hand in regard to its ancillary systems, Rise never gets in its own way, and offers a fun experience for both casual players looking for short bursts of fun, as well as the more hardcore looking for a time sink.",,Monster Hunter Rise on PS5 is a fantastic experience - especially for newcomers or fans who have been unable to get stuck in until now.,,,,"If you loved playing MH: World you will most definitely fall in love with MH: Rise, too. All the great stuff you know and love is still in Rise with some smaller tweaks and additions. I had a good time and it was worth waiting for the graphically improved version.

The game performs perfectly and gives more players the opportunity to head to Kamura Village for another awe inspiring adventure.,,,,,,,,"The ultimate hunting experience comes to PlayStation consoles with performance improvements and innovative gameplay features, but Monster Hunter Rise could have a better UX. It's uninviting system and the information overload are not very friendly for those who are new to the series.",,,"Monster Hunter Rise gets a third life on Sony and Microsoft consoles and succeeds, with a few bumps in the road. If you can't take away the fact that it's extremely generous, devilishly enjoyable and relatively clean visually, you also tend to think that there could have been more.",,,,"Monster Hunter Rise is the new standard for the series, and it's a delight to finally have it on PlayStation, thanks to the improved frame rate and visual fidelity over the original release. There's so much to it that there are still many things we haven't mentioned, like the new monster riding, sped-up collecting and mining, or the hunting helpers. It's a game this reviewer put over 100 hours in on the Switch, and we could be looking at 100 more on PS5. Monster Hunter's eternally satisfying gameplay loop is met with now-essential quality of life and traversal improvements.","Suppose you were very patient and hoped that Monster Hunter Rise would come out on PS5. Guess what, congratulations. In that case, you will have a very worthy version of an entertaining video game that, until now, could only be enjoyed on two different power platforms.

It boasts several brilliant innovations and is very welcoming towards newer players. I can’t get enough!",,,,,,"Monster Hunter Rise is a solid RPG that will require dedication to conquer. Once you figure out your play style and get comfortable with the game’s many systems, it’s fun to gear up, grab some food, and proceed to take on as many missions as you have the time for. Combat may feel sluggish, and there are certainly better-looking games out there.

destiny-2-the-witch-queen,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The highest compliment I can give any game is when I have to force myself to put the controller down to put my thoughts in a review. Destiny 2: The Witch Queen is that game. Somehow Bungie took a game that I play daily, for hours a week, and made me want to play it more. It's always good getting new content with seasons and past expansions, and I have loved all Destiny 2 additions. However, The Witch Queen feels like we have entered a new age. The Witch Queen has proven that no one is better than Bungie at what they do. The Witch Queen takes every aspect of Destiny and improves on it, and then some. While Destiny is always getting better, The Witch Queen is the best piece of Destiny content ever created.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Destiny 2: The Witch Queen is an achievement in storytelling for Bungie, which somehow has two more expansions still to come for its ongoing game.

It’s both a culmination of years of story and prelude to something much bigger.",,"Destiny 2 The Witch Queen lifts Destiny 2 to new heights with a spectacular story, a large amount of content and many improvements to gameplay.

Whether you're thinking about returning to the franchise or picking up the game for the first time ever, The Witch Queen is a brilliant starting point for your new adventures.",,,,,"Destiny 2: The Witch Queen expands, improves, and refines everything that already works extremely well, proving that this game as a service is still far from exhaustion. Moreover, it offers an engaging new journey, important revelations, and a turning point that only builds on promise for what lies ahead.",,,,"I am already itching to get back to playing it, but in closing: The Witch Queen is undoubtedly the best overall campaign experience that Bungie has ever released, as a result of its great story, cool tweaks to gameplay, and inclusion of puzzles and mechanics previously restricted only to endgame content.

But perhaps this is just the cost of doing business as a casual Destiny player.",,,,,,"Despite its shortcomings as an entry point for new players, there's a lot packed into The Witch Queen worth appreciating – we haven't even mentioned the new Glaive weapon type that combines melee with long-range attacks, the hugely enjoyable new Lost Sectors, or the overhaul to the Void subclass, bringing it more in line with Beyond Light's Stasis. This pushes the number of viable types to ""two"", which isn't great, but Arc and Solar should be getting a similar upgrade in the (hopefully) near future. Seasonal content will continue to deliver story as 2022 wears on, but obviously the quality of it cannot be judged yet – the expansion isn't even complete at the time of typing, what with the new Raid yet to drop. Still, this is Destiny 2 at its very best and a pleasingly vital expansion to what remains a superb game.",,,,,,,,,"After a strong couple of years, Destiny 2 has hit a new high in The Witch Queen. It’s undeniably the best expansion for the MMO shooter yet, with narrative payoffs both surprising and earned, a fantastic campaign, and fun new gear to chase and build. Destiny 2 Year 5 is off to an excellent start, and the future has never been brighter for the franchise.",,,,,,"More than a collection of new gear, The Witch Queen is a significant moment for the story – and, to a lesser extent, the mechanics – of Destiny.

Destiny 2: The Witch Queen may not be the best overall expansion in Destiny history, but this queen sure does put on a good show while it lasts.",,,"Destiny 2: The Witch Queen is the next chapter in an already exhilarating game, a chapter that in and of itself reiterates and expands on the existing excellence of the core game. With a thrilling new campaign, an exciting new weapon, the addition of crafting and its impact on the weapon economy, and an upgraded subclass, The Witch Queen is Destiny at its all-time best.",,,,"The Witch Queen is a terrific addition to the Destiny 2 canon, finally balancing the combat and the story to near perfect levels. There’s so much here to enjoy, breathing new life into Destiny as a whole. Absolutely brilliant.",,,,"After a series of only half-successful expansions, Bungie has managed to hit the mark with The Whispering Queen, enriching its Destiny 2 with the best campaign ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Destiny 2: The Witch Queen is easily the best expansion since The Taken King. Savathûn and her story are engaging and thrilling to play, each mission putting the always stunning art and design on display. With glaive in hand, new mighty Void powers, and weapon crafting at your arsenal, Guardians will have a terrific time annihilating hordes of Hive in the campaign and raids. Unfortunately, it’s not a newbie-friendly expansion. The complicated narrative and deep history which is partly unplayable due to removed content, as well as awful UI, make it challenging for even previous players to jump back into the journey. If you’ve been playing Destiny 2 and still are, you need to play The Witch Queen.",,,,,,,,,"The Witch Queen is an especially robust expansion, with a particular focus on customizing the play experience and rewarding longtime players’ investment in story and systems. If it’s not the most welcoming moment for players to jump in, that may be a price the developers at Bungie are willing to pay at this point. The long-running story arc that opened in 2014 is gradually steering toward a climax, and it’s possible the developers are increasingly interested in building a ride for those who have been in the vehicle for a while now.",,,"Destiny 2: The Witch Queen represents the highest peak the franchise has seen in years, if not ever. Held back by some grindiness and nigh-inpenetrable plot gates, it’s one of the smoothest FPS experiences available today, thanks to its best story yet and a host of gameplay adjustments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
inscryption,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Inscryption is an amalgamation of deck-builder and escape room games, and is unlike anything I have ever played before. In an age of video games where uniqueness is at an all-time low, it was amazing to be so surprised at regular intervals.

It's a game where I fully feel like I have sculpted my deck myself; it's wild, it's dark and it's utterly brilliant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you like the idea of a game that defies genres and will constantly take you to places you don’t expect, pick up Inscryption. If you enjoy card-based roguelikes (with some other stuff thrown in), pick up Inscryption. If you want to play something unlike anything else, doing things that most other games wouldn’t dare to, pick up Inscryption. Just… be prepared for the unexpected. Time and time again.",,,,,,,"Inscryption appears to be a very niche roguelite deck-building card game. But it turns into so much more. It’s a must play for anyone who is a fan of experimental videogame storytelling. Anyone remotely curious, who enjoys a great mystery, should also play without hesitation. This is the highest review score I’ve given in a while, and I wasn’t drawn to the base gameplay at all. Inscryption is a special game, and a wholly unique experience. It’s going to be remembered as a benchmark of videogame storytelling years from now. I could not be more shocked or impressed.",,,"Inscryption is a card game that goes far beyond its initial premises, delivering narrative and gameplay twists on several occasions. It's a game that subverts all the player's expectations, renewing itself at each stage of its campaign. An easy-to-play roguelike, with complex mechanics and fun gameplay, as long as the randomness and restarts typical of the genre are tolerated. Inscryption is brilliant and you need to try it.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Inscryption's PS5 edition deserves every single praise. It's as good as the PC version that was released last year. It is a mysterious story with fun gameplay and many twists during the game. There are a few differences from the PC version, but nothing that messes up the experience. Inscryption is a must-have for those who like card games and solving puzzles.",,,,,,,"Inscryption is a great card battler, but to even call it that sells what is a truly unique experience short.

You're better off for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Without spoiling much, this is the best bit. From there it gets quite meta, and plays with some other card-based gameplay that ironically loses most of its bite by the end.

chicory-a-colorful-tale,,,,,,,,"Chicory: A Colorful Tale is a frequent delight. It’s probably one of the better games we’ve played this year. This from an indie. Forget Ratchet and Clank, fun though it is. Chicory is possibly our favourite game this year.",,,,,"Greg Lobanov has produced a game that has it all. It’s a truly heartwarming story with unique gameplay, clever puzzles and a colourful cast of characters in a gorgeous world that never feels limited by its retro-inspired, two-dimensional roots.",,,,,,,,,,"From the side quests to the main story, Chicory: A Colorful tale is a fun time that will hold players' attention to the end, especially fans of The Legend of Zelda franchise. There are some nitpicks one could make about certain gameplay moments that require pinpoint brush accuracy not working correctly or some of the platforming sections feeling off, but really the only big knock against it are the lackluster boss fights. It's otherwise close to being perfect for what it is and is certainly one of the better Zelda-like indie games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you like the idea of an open world adventure filled with wonderfully written characters, engaging puzzles and a heart-warming story, don’t hesitate to give Chicory: A Colorful Tale a try. It’s so much more than “a game you colour in yourself”; it’s a journey filled with heart and soul. It isn’t free of frustrations, but they’re easily forgiven thanks to just how charming and wonderfully unusual this adventure is.",,"Chicory is utterly joyous. It's a warm hug of a game bursting with creativity and surprises. Every inch of the ten-hour adventure fizzes with sheer, unrestrained invention - I already want to play through the whole thing again. This game is an absolute triumph on every level, I cannot stress to you enough. Even when you strip away the excellent gameplay, beautiful visuals, and toe-tappingly great soundtrack, you're left with a story that shows passion and creativity will always win against cynicism and hate. A must-play for all.",,,,"As previous Lobanov's games, Chicory finds an interesting balance between its story, that explores different human problems, and our own artistic expression by painting. An ""atypical"" game that you probably will love as much as you love painting, although you can enjoy it even without focusing on it.",,,,,,,,"Chicory: A Colorful Tale is a delightful experience that, while confronting some of the darker parts of creativity, will simply make you feel good. The world is cute and fun to explore, puzzles are a joy to solve, and coloring in the Picnic Province is relaxing.",,,,,,,Video games don't get much more heartwarming than Chicory: A Colorful Tale with its beautifully-interwoven gameplay and story.,,,,,,,,"An indie adventure with the confidence of heavy hitters like Undertale, Chicory: A Colorful Tale is one hell of a pleasant surprise that excels on every level it is possible to do so. Would it be too hackneyed to say it belongs in an art gallery?",,,,A charming and imaginative spin on The Legend Of Zelda that is filled with cleverly original ideas and a deceptively serious script that packs a real punch.,"Under its thick features and its childish airs, Chicory shelters very tough challenges. Together, creator Greg Lobanov (Wandersong) and composer Lena Raine (Celeste) have managed to shape a universe generous in exploration, discovery and obstacles to overcome, offering a completely correct lifespan. If you don't want to take the time to solve the ingenious puzzles that present themselves to you, you will have the leisure to get involved freely in the other small quests of the adorable world of Picnic, populated by its charming animals. On the other hand, let's repeat it, the adventure will be much better if you opt for the keyboard.","Chicory: A Colorful Tale is bound to the template set forth by The Legend of Zelda, but, rather than offering reflexive glibness, or inking the affair with irony, its critique wraps warmly around its subject, like a scarf.",,,,,,,,,"What elevates it from charming little indie to sitting alongside Celeste2 as a future classic is that beneath its cosy aesthetic is a beautifully written story that will resonate deeply with anyone who’s ever faced self-doubt or impostor syndrome. There’s also a wonderful reminder, aided by the many places you can just sit down, that sometimes you just need to take a break, even from the things you’re most passionate about.

It takes innovative, artistically driven mechanics and makes them accessible and intuitive. It combines them with a narrative which is emotionally charged and truly engrossing. This is all topped off with a fantastic world that houses oodles of charm, a top class soundtrack and puzzle design that challenges the player while rarely becoming frustrating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chicory: A Colorful Tale is a pristine little adventure with fun puzzles, a surprisingly rich paint mechanic, and a story that's disarmingly real, difficult, and heartfelt.",,,,,,,"As warm and refreshing as it is earnest and rejuvenating, Chicory is genuinely a game like few others and a joy to play. Even if, ironically, it sometimes limits the same creative capacity it encourages, Chicory also lets you know that’s fine.

But its gameplay lacks that spark that made Wandersong great.",,,,,,,,,"Chicory: A Colorful Tale spoke to me deeply. I think most people who have pursued any creative outlet will find something to latch onto in its story. If that were the only strength here, you’d have a game worth your time. When you combine that with a beautiful art style, fantastic music, entertaining exploration, thought-provoking puzzles, and unique boss battles, you have a masterpiece. Coming out during the lead-up to E3, the same week that several other heavy hitters release, it would be easy for Chicory to get lost in the shuffle. Don’t let them happen. Few games releasing in 2021 will be more worthy of your time.",,,,,,,,,,"It's difficult, in fact, to find much friction in the gameplay of A Colorful Tale that prevents you from experiencing its deeply moving tale, and it's balanced well enough to offer an engrossing adventure with standout puzzle mechanics and satisfying solutions. Chicory: A Colorful Tale is a game about self-exploration, frequently presenting earnest themes that can be challenging to engage with given how relatable they can feel. But it's also an exercise in confronting these insecurities and barriers that prevent you from enjoying what you put out into the world and rediscovering its importance in the process. It's an evocative tale that doesn't rest on its narrative alone, making it one of the best games you can play this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chicory: A Colorful Tale is a beautiful adventure where it’s your job to splash life back into this colourless world with the help of your magical paintbrush.

At a time when fans of the genre are in for a treat, Bandai Namco has decided to join the party and offer us one of the best instalments of the franchise. A perfect entry into the franchise, with an interesting story, charismatic characters, beautiful artwork and a combat system that's as accessible as it is deep. It takes a while to get going, but when it does, it's hard to put the controller down before starting the next dungeon.",,,,,"Tales of Arise is a fantastic entry in the long-running franchise, with a beautiful crafted world, unforgettable characters and a wonderful soundtrack. However, it also boasts a lot of technical problems that can't simply be ignored.","Overall Tales of Arise has a great premise and story, and is one of the better Tales games Bandai Namco has produced. If you are a JRPG fan, or a Tales fan give this game a good look.","Indeed, Tales of Arise is a game designed for long-term Tales franchise fans and those who have never picked up a franchise entry before, where story, combat, and various features come together to deliver a high-quality, highly-detailed JRPG. All of that makes it not just one of the best JRPGs on the market today, but one of the best games hands-down.",,,,"Tales of Arise is magnificent. The writing is rich and evocative, and the developers took on a major creative challenge with the themes that they decided to tackle… and did a superb job. The combat system is sharp and offers plenty of complexity, while being accessible to Tales newcomers or people just looking to experience the story. The art and aesthetics are breathtaking, and about the only issue there is a lack of a photo mode so that I could make the most of it (what the hell, Bandai Namco?). I may not have been the world’s biggest fan of the Tales series previously, but this game has immediately become one of my favourite JRPGs of all time.","Tales of Arise accomplishes the rare feat of catering to its many fans while simultaneously making a compelling case for newcomers to give it a try, and it's a JRPG must-play that was more than worth the wait.",,,"Tales of Arise is the best option for this year regarding the JRPG genre. It is a game that you will fall in love with through its storytelling and a set of characters for whom you can actually feel something. Tt also features an acceptable progression system as well as fun battles, some interesting main missions (not so much for the secondary stuff), optional events, impactful visuals... it has everything.","The latest entry in the Tale series offers everything loyal fans could have expected, but also has a chance to enamor many newcomers. The story about two heroes from the opposite sides of a conflict joining forces is surprisingly multi-layered, the combat is flashy and satisfying, and the journey leads you across beautiful, varied regions. As for the flaws, I need to mention problems with map legibility and the necessity to grind, but fortunately both issues are occasional.

The big boss battles that blew me away, and the wonderful feeling of free-forming a combo into a Mystic Arte and then closing the battle off with a Boost Strike. The story was ultimately good, and the world was gorgeous. But really, it’s going to be the campfire moments. It’s going to be how Alphen, Shionne, Rinwell, Law, Kisara, and Dohalim came together as a party, grew closer, fought and struggled together, and saw it all through to the end, one hastily thrown-together outdoor meal at a time. Tales of Arise nails that, and so it feels like a strong step forward for a series with a bright future ahead of it.",,"Tales of Arise is the peak of Tales of franchise, where the dev team managed to use years of experience to craft something really great.",,,,"With Tales of Arise, I think the Tales series is finally ready to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the heavy hitters of the JRPG genre – Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. This is a masterfully crafted adventure, and the best JRPG I've played in a very long time. Combining stunning visuals with a gripping story and the most exciting combat system found in a JRPG yet, this is a must-have for fans of the genre. Its standalone story makes this a great entry point for those looking to get into the Tales series, too. Put simply, Tales of Arise is outstanding.",,,"Tales of Arise offers a superb blend of JRPG favourites, tight combat, and modern-day design choices. It's easily the best Tales game in years.",,"Tales of Arise delivers a fresh start with new heroes and a world that feels all too familiar. The story of an oppressed people living in a land divided into five parts, that need to be liberated isn't quite original, but Arise does offer a streamlined experience that can be highly tailored. Those that want to, can delve into the lore, while others can happily skip that entirely. The same applies to combat, which can be tailored to the player's desire, from (semi)automatic to manual and challenging.",Tales of Arise is a high-quality JRPG and the next technical leap in a series that continues to take steps in the right direction on the occasion of its 25th anniversary. The playable renewal that it proposes places it as one of the most powerful titles of the year and as an excellent entry for players looking to get started in the franchise.,"Tales of Arise was a fresh but familiar experience. The game iterated on the series formula enough to keep progressing the series while maintaining the Tales charm. The combat system is as fluid as ever, and I found it to be engaging and fun. The area that the game shines the most is in its characters, both during the course of the main story or the skits that break up the action. Overall, Tales of Arise is a great example of a classic series that keeps improving while maintaining its identity.",,,,,,,"Tales of Arise is a huge leap forward for the series. Combat is incredibly fun and fluid, the story is fantastic despite a lackluster finale, and the characters are as charming as ever. It’s not only one of the best Tales games, but one of the best the PS5 has to offer.",,"Tales of Arise has a chaotic, but manageable and strategic combat system, a vibrant and beautifully crafted world for you to explore and characters you can see yourself in. The main thread of the story - an underdog bringing an end to tyranny - is a great set-up.",,"I came away from Tales of Arise with a new appreciation for the Tales series.

Tales of Arise is an excellent action RPG, and a fantastic entry point into the series.",,"Deluxe-RPG with a magnificent universe and a prime storyline, which however only unfolds late. Bland side quests tarnish the overall picture.","Tales of Arise is a masterpiece with a deep story and endearing cast that will keep you hooked as you fight for freedom from tyrants. Meanwhile, the action-intense battles are great fun as you plan your moves to take down enemies as efficiently as possible. Exploring the dungeons and overworld is a joy, too, especially with new map abilities that make traversal engaging. It's the best Tales yet.",,,"Tales of Arise is a successfully comeback story. It’s definitely one of the most refreshing Tales game and probably one of the best JRPGs launched in 2021. I’m not sure if Bandai Namco planned to make the Tales franchise mainstream, but that’s something that Tales of Arise manage to achieve, and that’s probably the best compliment I can give the game. My only concern is related to how Bandai Namco chose to advertise the paid DLC in-game, which consists of cosmetic items and spice up your adventures through Dahna. Resting in camps will always run an advert in the right corner, which totally breaks immersion. Other than that, I believe Tales of Arise is not just the best game in the Tales series, but also one of the best titles launched this year. More importantly, the Tales franchise has finally gone mainstream and I’m very happy that more players are joining its fan club.","Tales of Arise is a fantastic RPG. With a big storyline that's much more complex than it looks, and touching characters, great design, combat playability, very nervous and close to a beat'em all, and very satisfying roleplaying aspects. And if the PS5 version doesn't have the most insane optimization, it's been a real pleasure to play this Tales of Arise. If J-RPG is your thing, you shouldn't miss it.",,"It’s been a while, but Tales of Arise is finally here. And you know what? It was worth the wait. This is one hell of an RPG, with an epic story drenched in adventure and atmosphere. The combat is accessible, yet deep and challenging, and the journey takes you to some truly remarkable places. Shame the sidecontent isn’t always quite as interesting.",,"Tales of Arise went above and beyond our expectations. With its picturesque landscapes instilling a real sense of adventure, it's easily one of the strongest, most cohesive Tales games to date. Dramatic cutscenes and memorable character moments help sell an intriguing story, while a satisfying combat system becomes more and more engaging as your party powers up. A fantastic, modernised journey with all the rewarding qualities of a classic JRPG.",,"A very good action JRPG. Very traditional, very spectacular, well done, a feast for eyes and ears, fun and addictive. It’s not, however, innovative in any way.","Tales of Arise doesn't do anything new, but also almost nothing wrong. The story continues to captivate from start to finish, although some of the plot twists are quite predictable for the seasoned JRPG player. The combat is the showpiece of the game and offers wonderful depth, challenges your tactical ability and is a feast for the eyes. You take the small flaws for granted and quickly forget as you wander through the beautiful settings of Dahna and beyond.",,"Tales of Arise brilliantly succeeds in breathing new life into the Tales Of saga. With its universe and its successful characters, the title delivers a striking adventure that takes advantage of superb environments thanks to a unique graphic rendering.

If we can blame it for his clipping, its talkative side, or its redundant bestiary, we still salute its many qualities which suggest good for the future of the series.",,"Tales of Arise is a triumph in almost every way, delivering a strong narrative, well-developed characters, and combat that feels snappier than ever. This is the next step in the evolution of the Tales series, and the future looks awfully bright.","Tales of Arise is gorgeous. The lands are lush and vibrant, even those trapped in extreme weather patterns. Calaglia’s arid landscape makes me thirsty and trudging through Cyslodia’s tundra reminds me of long Canadian winters. Sadly this all seems to be lost when it’s time to throw in some anime. The switch from game graphics to anime cutscenes is actually rather jarring and I’m not a fan. I like the anime separately as its own entity, just not within the game itself. If the coloring matched the game, sure. But it washes out all of the hard work the level design team put into the game. Pair this with just way too much going on with the artes system and you can see how, though a fantastic game, it falls just shy of hitting a perfect ten.",,"Tales of Arise is able to please both longtime fans of the saga and newbies: accessible, aesthetically satisfying and always with a smooth pace, it has managed to refresh the combat system with an excellent compromise between action and strategy , without however setting aside the parametric component: an adventure that absolutely deserves to be lived.","Surprising twists and turns, a more serious story and the picturesque graphics entice Tales of Arise with many hours of JRPG fun in a slightly lifeless and linear world.",,,,"Some JRPG-typical dramatics and muddled combat aside, Arise is a feast for any JRPG fan – beautiful, intuitive and earnest.

It’s the advancement the series has needed for quite some time now, such as the far more explorative dungeon designs (as small as they are) and the switch to the Unreal Engine. On top of that, the majority of the cast of characters are compelling enough to keep your attention locked on the story, and the combat reinvigorates the tried and true formula into something special.","Tales of Arise offers fast and fluid combat and an epic story, paving the way for the first great JRPG of a new console generation.",This is a fantastic JRPG that builds upon its great art style and its spectacular battles.,"For those who thirst for the epic JRPGS of old, Tales of Arise manages to live up to lofty expectations and then some.","Tales of Arise reinvigorates the magic of the long-running series. A franchise that long rested on its established laurels has been refreshingly upgraded and reinvented, resulting in one of the most polished and jaw-dropping JRPGs I've played in a long time. It's an exciting new chapter for the Tales series that won't be soon forgotten.","Tales of Arise is the grand adventure we've been waiting for, and more, for veteran players and new fans alike. Its addictive and satisfying combat design, breathtaking narrative, gorgeous presentation, and engaging cast make it the quintessential JRPG to play. The characters met in this entry add to the growing cast of memorable personalities this series has given us, solidifying it as a true Tales title.","Tales of Arise achieved steady progress under the traditional JRPG framework. With a solid plot and refreshing battle, a very good JRPG experience has been created for players. Although the overall quality is very high, the game still has some problems in character creation and story logic, which prevents it from reaching the peak of the JRPG category.","With a beautiful new style, a more adult narrative, wonderful characters, and a modernised tone and feel, Tales of Arise brings the franchise smashing into the current era. It’s still got the tried-and-true Tales flavour, both good and bad, yet innovates with fluid combat that feels fresh. The best and most essential Tales game in well over a decade.","Tales of Arise is a well-made, consistently enjoyable JRPG, and though its storytelling tends to be inconsistent, its gorgeous world and consistently enjoyable combat are more than enough to keep you hooked until the end.","For an adventure game, the graphics and story are pretty interesting, but for an JRPG, the game is lacking in a lot of elements. While it has RPG trappings, it feels far more like an adventure/action game, which is a knock against those looking for some JRPG action. The graphics, story, characters and overall package are very well done. However it is hard to shake the feeling of the game being far more style over substance, which in general JRPG-ers are not looking for.","With a fun and intuitive combat system, some clever characterization and a gorgeous oil painting look, Tales of Arise is a must have JRPG which shows a confident step in the right direction for the series as a whole.",,"Tales of Arise is the best game in the series, with a brilliant combat system and a story with a lot of important themes tied to the atrocious consequences of post-colonialism.",,,,,"Tales of Arise has all the familiar features that we know and (mostly) love from the “Tales of” series (i.e. combat system, skits, great characters etc.), but at the same time it surpasses most of its predecessors by excelling visually, aesthetically and in its world building.",,"The Tales series celebrates its 25 years with a fantastic title that deserves to be played by all fans of the genre, in yet another demonstration of the good path that Bandai Namco has traced over the last few years, at least with PIs that don't come from known Anime and Manga. The intricate narrative accompanied by a relatable cast bursting with personality and an artistic direction so rich that paints the game's combat and setting elevates the series and makes Tales of Arise one of the best JRPGs of 2021.",,,"With an excellent story and cast and a reinvigorated combat system, Tales of Arise is the shot in the arm the long-running Tales RPG series needed to recapture its best moments.",,,"Tales Of Arise is a treat for fans of the franchise, but also an excellent jumping-on point for franchise newcomers.",,,This feels like a safe yet enjoyable follow-up to Berseria. Longtime fans will be satisfied with this entry after the five-year wait since the last mainline game even though Tales of Arise doesn’t feel like it strays too far away from the standard series formula.,"Tales of Arise is a revitalizing step in the right direction for the Tales of series, offering new players a chance to play Tales at its very best, and old fans an incredible journey that feels familiar. It’s hard not to love what Tales of Arise has to offer and while there are some small issues, it doesn’t take away from my opinion that this is the Tales game that will breathe new life into the series.","While Tales of Arise isn't perfect by any means, it is a meaty, colourful, and engaging game that I think should be on any self-respecting JRPG fans must-play list. Mastering the action combat is a thrilling and rewarding experience, as is the satisfaction of finding rare materials to craft with or taking down massive beasts for big rewards. The overarching plot is richly detailed, filled with twists and turns that will keep you interested, all while embarking on the journey with a party of well-realised characters. With some minor flaws found in the game's competing visual styles, graphical options, and side quest content, I think there are more than enough positives to be found that Tales of Arise could easily end up being one of the best RPGs released this year.","Bandai Namco promised that “now is the time for change,” and Tales of Arise legitimately feels like a game that’s trying to bring change to Japanese RPGs. It’s strong characters, epic story, engrossing battle system, and lush visuals are only marred by a disappointing final act, and those areas of the game where the team refused to let go of outdated ideas and conventions. If the Tales team can find it in themselves to push things just a little further, then this might truly be the spark that sets off a revolution in a genre that’s needed a regime change for so long now.",,,,,,"Tales of Arise brings some needed fresh air to its beloved Action JRPG franchise while sticking faithfully to its classic formula. The renewed visuals and the more mature art-style should not alienate the fandom: at its core, this game is a very classic Tales of title, with new additions that make it an even more memorable experience.","Arise is a good episode, which could have been excellent if it didn't get its feet wet in its last third. At the moment of concluding and confirming all the nice things put forward during the journey, the series falls back into its old ways with unbearable corridors, full of color swap enemies on 10 hours of gameplay that leave a bitter taste. It's a pity, especially since the combat system and the world building are the most solid we've seen on a Tales Of in quite some time.","Tales of Arise harmoniously balances beloved systems like visual novel-inspired skits and upgradable titles with new-and-improved gameplay tweaks. Intricate world-building in sub-quests and even mundane discussions help with pacing and narrative cohesion. Campy JRPG-centric themes like the power of friendship and slow-burn romantic tension are prevalent throughout. Nevertheless, I found myself completely invested in the tragedies and achievements the cast faced, even when awkward pauses and stiff cutscene animations threatened to break immersion. Tales of Arise is a fantastic reinvention of Bandai Namco’s tried and true formula. It might even be the best installment in the franchise to date.",,Tales of Arise is a beautiful JRPG that is fun to play that fans of the genre will no doubt get a lot out of. Its gradual introduction of mechanics also makes it a wonderful experience for those looking to dip their toes into JRPGs for the first time or after a long time away from them.,,"Tales of Arise is a great game and a significant step forward from its predecessor, a wonderful mix of bright narrative and excellent gameplay.",,,,"If this is anything to go off, the series has years left in it yet. This title makes it clear that the folks at Bandai Namco have it in them to move with the times, without losing the essence of what a Tales game is.",,,,"A great experience and brand new breath for the saga. Tales of Arise doesn't quite shake itself from bad old habits in the second part of the game, but it won't spoil its charm and the very interesting story.","After previous attempts only achieved half-measures, Tales of Arise finally takes the series in a new direction. There are sure to be veterans who lament some of the changes in the name of expanding the audience, but the risks taken here pay off nicely. The visuals are a marked improvement from any previous entry, and the combat looks and feels better than ever, even if it comes at the cost of losing some depth. Arise’s narrative admirably tackles some ambitious themes, though not all beats hit their mark. However, despite a few flaws, Tales of Arise is a fantastic RPG that stands as one of the best the series has to offer.",,"Tales of Arise is an excellent JRPG that delivers just about everything you want from the genre: a rich story, intriguing characters, satisfying combat, and an endless amount of lore. The game isn’t able to skirt around the issues that often plague JRPGs, which I feel will make for a higher barrier of entry for newcomers. That said, Fans of the series and those that just love a good JRPG will fall in love with what’s there in Tales of Arise.","Combining the best ideas of the past three generations of 3D action JRPGs, stripped of excess and micromanagement, Tales of Arise is one of the most tactile and frenetic action-narrative experiences to come out of Japan in recent memory.","Taken as a whole, Tales of Arise is a very good RPG, boasting beautiful visuals, a wonderful cast of characters, and engaging combat mechanics--but its flaws (and that odious DLC) are also difficult to ignore. If you're looking for a lengthy, charming, and engaging JRPG to play on your shiny new console or PC gaming rig, Tales of Arise is certainly a fine choice. Just don't go into it expecting an all-time classic.",,"Tales of Arise is a fun game, but one with a bit of tonal disparity to it. One moment, you'll be searching for owls wearing goofy accessories on behalf of the owl king, and then next you'll watch in horror as a town of people is literally liquified before your eyes. As long as you try not to think too much about the stifling and nearly overwhelming amount of horror the characters have been put through, you'll likely feel like you got your money's worth of this very long and winding game.",,Tales of Arise heralds a brilliant new dawn for the series and is one of the best RPGs of the last generation.,,"Tales of Arise is a thrilling JRPG to play. While the story takes a bit of time to get going, a complex combat system and some neat time-saving options mean you'll always come back for more.","Tales of Arise is a games I would recommend for anyone looking for “the future” of the JRPG genre. This game could easily be Bandai Namco’s Final Fantasy 7. It feels tailor-made for the era and pushes the barriers for RPGs thanks to complex combat, weighty storytelling, and gorgeous visuals.",,,,,,,"With its engaging story, dark atmosphere, charming characters, and excellent combat, Tales of Arise provides an experience that feels both new and familiar at the same time, making for a game that both long-time fans and newcomers will enjoy. While the excessive linearity and the removal of multiplayer will disappoint some, the pros far outweigh the cons, making Tales of Arise one of the best entries in the series to date.",,,,"Tales of Arise is exactly what I want in a Tales of game, but also a JRPG in general. It fulfills the promise of a modern-day Tales of title in a way no other game in the series has managed in over a decade. While Tales of Arise is clearly influenced by previous games in the series, it also takes cues from other long-running series like Xenoblade Chronicles and Star Ocean. However, Tales of Arise is its own beast—a refreshing, smartly designed, and just plain fun monument to its genre. I cannot recommend it highly enough.","Tales of Arise includes the trademarks of the franchise and shows that twenty-five years of experience help to strive for perfection. Just like a good wine, the franchise has managed to get better with age. The battle system, anime-inspired visuals, and a story full of lovely characters are the stars of the show, which ultimately make a game that shouldn’t be overlooked. Tales of Arise is an entry that will satisfy die-hard fans and convert newcomers to the series with its awesome experience.",,"Tales of Arise is an excellent introduction to the series for new players and a fantastic entry for old fans. If this is any indication, the franchise is in for a bright future. Hopefully, it won’t be another five years before the next one.",,,,,"Tales of Arise is a phenomenal game: an engrossing story, the best combat the Tales series has seen to date, and art direction that's nigh unmatched in its sheer beauty. But, impressive as those things are, what really sets this game apart—what really marks this as a bold new vision for the series—is how cleverly it twists JRPG conventions to unpack that well-worn ""evil empire"" trope. Tales of Arise is more than just a brilliant game; it's a nuanced, insightful thesis on the mechanisms of oppression and liberation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
octopath-traveler-ii,,,,,,,,,,,,,An outstanding achievement from start to finish. Octopath Traveler II takes what made the original such a success and builds on it. It may feel more of the same but why fix something if it isn't broken. The additions made to exploration and combat are all for the better. The only real issue is that not much effort went into making the game less grandy or addressing the various difficulty spikes Octopath Traveler II suffers from.,,,"A JRPG that refines, polishes and perfects the formula explored by its predecessor, delivering an experience that borders on excellence in each of its sections, including its addictive combat system. A must for fans of the genre, especially for those who miss the stories that do not tend to grandiloquence.",,,,,,,,,"When all is said and done, and the eight storytellers have finally found a way to make their narratives line up and come together to deliver the exciting finale, Octopath Traveler 2 makes for a satisfying night at the bar. It’s full of pathos and excitement that pushes you forward, and the gameplay is tight and enjoyable. You can’t help but wish it was a little more well-structured, but seeing how the storytellers learned so much from their previous attempt, it’s hard not to look forward to the tales they’ll tell next time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Octopath Traveler II is an excellent example of how to release a classic JRPG with a modern flair. Its engaging narrative and captivating characters by themselves already deliver a highly valuable title, but it is on the rich simplicity of its combat where it reaches an even higher bar. The small technical issues, excessive random encounters and simplistic character evolution system are the only complaints that can be made about a title that delights at every minute.",,,,,"Octopath Traveler II is a case of, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Almost everything is very similar to the first game, but there's more content, and the features are smoother. There are a number of areas where the developers clearly had more confidence than they had in the original Octopath. I loved the first game, and I found the second to be a more enjoyable experience in pretty much every way. It's a charming, delightful, and incredibly fun JRPG experience that fans of old-school RPGs should relish.",,,,,Octopath Traveler 2 is a successful sequel that builds on the strengths of its predecessor and brings meaningful improvements.,,,,,,,,,"Octopath Traveler II presents enough rich, turn-based action to forgive its minor combat system flaws. It's a breath-taking work of art, filled to the brim with story and adventure, bolstered by a cast of incredible characters who will leave you wanting more at every turn. A masterfully crafted RPG.","Octopath Traveler II is what a JRPG should be. It does have eight compelling stories, solid and fun combat, and quite relaxing music. It should be in the collection of any JRPG fan.",,"Underneath the beautiful presentation lies a great JRPG that unfortunately lingers a little too much in its old glory. Being nostalgic for the past is super fun, but things like the random encounters, the turn-based battles and the story have really gotten better in modern RPGs. I also expect that from Octopath Traveler 2.",,"Octopath Traveler had set the bar so high in 2018 that it was not certain that its successor would manage to do as well. If it is not necessarily very daring in terms of novelties, this second opus above all strives to refine an already almost perfect formula by integrating ever more subtleties. Fascinating in terms of the scenario, the game system and the strategy resulting from the fights, the title also displays a mastery of HD-2D more fascinating than ever with striking light effects. Too bad the emotion is a little less palpable throughout the adventure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"When compared to the original, Octopath Traveler II is largely more of the same but better. The battle system is just as enjoyable as it was the first time around with additional layers of strategy added. Solistia is a great new world to explore, and the added day and night cycle help make everywhere feel more alive. While at its core it plays like a classic turn-based JRPG, the Break and Boost system helps set it apart from the classics that inspired it. The HD-2D graphic style does a fantastic job in making Octopath Traveler II feel both contemporary and classic with one of the best soundtracks among recent games. It hits the sweet spot where it brings enough elements of contemporary gaming to the classic JRPG format.",,,,,,"Modern games are all about the player experience, but Octopath Traveler 2 isn't. If you change your mindset and take the time to experience it, you can feel the magic that keeps people hooked despite its awkwardness. It's like a thick adventure book, with exciting content no matter when you open it, and once you close it, you won't miss it too much. Octopath Traveler 2 is indeed a game that chooses its players, and I am happy to go back and forth with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you loved Octopath Traveler or are just a fan of expansive JRPGs, Octopath Traveler II is for you. Its cast is appealing and varied, even if the accompanying shifts in tone and stakes between each character’s storyline can feel jarring at times. The combat is also a joy, rewarding experimentation and customisation, despite the amount of level grinding required later in the game. If you want a fun, if familiar-feeling, JRPG that will last you a while, Octopath Traveler II will absolutely do the trick.",,,,"Octopath Traveler II will correct what was not convincing in the first game. Although the game is very close to what has already been seen, it is still an excellent JRPG. Now we have new mechanics that make it a more strategic game. The interaction between characters is much better because of how they relate to each other. If you liked the first game, you'll love this one for sure.",,"Octopath Traveler II is a solid JRPG that shines beyond its nostalgic tricks. With fantastic storytelling, beautiful visuals, an exceptional soundtrack, and engaging combat mechanics, the game delivers 8 memorable journeys. While it stays in line with its predecessor, Team Asano and Acquire understood the areas of improvement and worked to deliver a great experience.",,"With 8 interesting destinies to follow, an HD-2D aesthetic more charming than ever and a divine OST, Octopath Traveler 2 has absolutely everything it needs in its bag to make old school Japanese RPG lovers have a good time. Beware, however, of this particular structure, character chapter by character chapter, which can still put you off, despite the developers' efforts to make the whole thing much more pleasant to play.",,,,,"Octopath Traveler II is the worthy second chapter of a series that made the history of the genre to which it belongs. The influences deriving from the predecessor are more than obvious, but the filings made to the formula, the additions and the large amount of content make it one of the best JRPGs out there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Octopath Traveler II plays it safe when it comes to its core gameplay, offering a handful of small positive tweaks that don’t entirely make up for returning problems like clumsy party management and battles that take too long to wrap up. Thankfully, the game also takes a big, confident step forward in writing, offering a cast of well-wrought, interesting characters and a vividly-detailed world you won’t soon forget. Octopath Traveler II may have the same old engine under the hood, but the road trip it takes you on is well worth experiencing.",,,,"Memory is a funny thing. It can distort our perceptions of our lives, and our experiences aren’t ever really what we remember. Even when the specifics of a memory fade away, though, the feeling of the moment remains. Octopath Traveler II captures the feeling of those memories beautifully, and it’s not a game I’ll soon forget.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Crash Bandicoot 4 on PS5 is pretty much unchanged from PS4, still offering excellent gameplay, but this time with mouth-watering 4K visuals. DualSense use is slight but noticeable; however, useful Game Help guides and Activity Cards make the upgrade well worth checking out for those still collecting secrets.",,,,,,,,,"A lot of effort went into creating distinctive worlds, and they help the game constantly feel fresh and fun. Really, that could be the tagline for Crash 4: fresh and fun. It may be based on a franchise that started a few decades and generations ago, but this new entry feels resolutely modern. It’s a wonderful addition to a series that you’re sure to enjoy, regardless of whether you’ve been waiting for it for many years, or you’re coming to Crash Bandicoot for the first time.",,"Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time on PlayStation 5 is without question an improvement upon last gen. If for any reason you owned the game on PlayStation 4, there’s no excuse not to experience how absolutely crisp and clean the game is on updated hardware. The core experience remains difficult, fun, and nostalgic, hitting all the right notes a classic Crash game would. Is there a chance for a Crash 5? Let’s just hope it’s a matter of time.",,,,"The only obvious upgrade for Crash Bandicoot 4 is the decreased load times, but they are shortened enough to say that the PS5 version is better than the PS4. While many gamers may not care about slight visual enhancements, they will definitely appreciate the time they are saved by playing Crash 4 on the PS5. It would have been awesome for the game to utilize the PS5's hardware a little better, but it's still the same great adventure - just a little faster, which is certainly an improvement, even if it's ultimately a pretty minor one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Even if the PS5 edition isn't a game-changer, Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time is still a delightfully charming title. The environments are bright and colorful, the characters are filled with emotion, the music is bright, and the overall experience just as charming as Crash Bandicoot was so many years ago.",,,The PS5 provides crisp 4K visuals and insanely fast load times. It's worth a play for Crash fans and those that haven't had the joy of taking control of everyone's favourite Bandicoot.,,,,,,,,,,,"Running on the new console, It's About Time just looks excellent. The cartoonish art style, with its bright colours, clean lines, and expressive animation, is absolutely gorgeous at 4K resolution. While it isn't using HDR (as far as we know), it still really sings on a 4K display. What's more, the game is locked at 60 frames-per-second on PS5, running buttery smooth regardless of how chaotic things get.",,,,,"The epic is just more beautiful and smoother than the original one, sometimes giving the impression of being in front of a real animated film, especially in front of the carefully animated cutscenes. On PlayStation 5, adaptive triggers add a little extra to the immersion.",,,"At its heart, this is the same Crash Bandicoot 4 that we loved last year when it came to PS4. The improved loading times alone are enough to make the PS5 version stand out, and the enhanced visuals are an added treat, seeing Crash in native 4K at 60 fps. Additional PS5 features round out the package, but as I played, it was mostly just the improved loading that really stuck out to me as the defining feature of this next-gen port.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Crash Bandicoot fans got what they asked for last year with a proper follow-up that honored the legacy of Naughty Dog’s classic trilogy. Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time embraced the mechanics that made the franchise such a hit while adding its own unique spin. The move to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S maintains the same essence that made the game so enjoyable last year, but it now looks and runs better. The visuals are cleaner and the frame rate runs at a solid 60fps. DualSense support is lackluster compared to other titles, but the smart use of Activity Cards makes up for it. With a free upgrade available for current owners, and the ability to import saves from the cloud, hopping back into Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time is simple, or start a whole new adventure for the first time. Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time was the return to form the franchise needed and it’s looking good on next-gen.",,,"Crash Bandicoot is starting off his 25th anniversary celebration in style with an upgraded version of what was already a stellar game. The number of changes may be fairly minimal overall, but there is no reason not to experience Crash at his very best on new generation hardware with Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time.",,,,"Crash Bandicoot 4 It’s About Time is still the best Crash Bandicoot has ever been, and deserves to be played if you have any interest in platformers or loved the originals way back when. The PS5 upgrade gives it a thin but noticeable lick of paint to stand alongside the next-generation, and a reason to dive back in.",,"Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time is a great game. Although its difficulty can be frustrating and some lengthy sequences are tedious, the world design is crisp and filled with humour, the levels overflow with creativity and most importantly, completing a level is satisfying. The plot is thin, but the cartoony vibes provoke a great mix of nostalgia and charm. The PlayStation 5 upgrade significantly improves load times and takes the game's visuals to another level. Crash fans have much to love in this long-awaited sequel. Although newcomers to the series may be turned off by how punishing the game can be, this title is an adventure worth embarking on.","Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time arrives on PlayStation 5, with many graphic and technical improvements.","It was already a wonderful game to watch on the PlayStation 4, and on the PS5 it is even more flashy: the new version of Crash 4 is fluid and graphically razor-sharp, thanks to the 60 fps frame rate and the 4K resolution; however, the visual upgrade is not all-encompassing, and certainly does not distort the glance of the production. The update for the new Sony and Microsoft consoles, which - we remember - is free and supports the transfer of old gen saves, therefore fulfills its duty without overdoing it, limiting itself to maximizing the strengths of the technical sector. Too bad only for a rather lazy implementation of DualSense, whose features are not valued sufficiently: the use of haptic feedback and a more decisive use of adaptive triggers could in fact have given the experience a more distinctive touch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lively, varied and sometimes quite challenging: Crash Bandicoot 4 builds on the N.Sane Trilogy - on current systems even more vibrant and a little more beautiful.",,,,,,,,,,"Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time may not be the biggest upgrade over its last-generation release, but for a game that just came out a year prior, it does what it needs to do and presents the best console version of an already well-polished game for players to enjoy.","The Next (Current?) Gen patch of Crash 4: It's About Time ups the resolution to a majestic 4K, guaranteeing stable 60fps in every situation. Plus, it's completely free.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"On PS5 specifically, developer Toys for Bob has also added some DualSense haptics, but they don't contribute much to the experience. When playing as characters other than Crash or Coco--Tawna, Neo Cortex, and Dingodile--some moves now come with a very weak haptic response. Using Tawna's grappling hook, for example, elicits a very, very mild trigger shake. Moving from space to space on the Dimensional Map also has a little bit of trigger feedback in addition to a rumble. The haptics really don't add anything, though it isn't as if they felt missing from the original release.",,,,,,,,,,,,Modernized nostalgic bomb stuffed with tons of content. Toys for Bob did it brilliantly again. I just want to know one thing: when will we get GEX? [Issue#310],,,,,"A very pretty and slick platformer that runs beautifully on PS5.

yakuza-like-a-dragon,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yakuza: Like A Dragon on PS5 is still the same great game as it was on PS4. However, as upgrades go, there isn't much here for new players and PS5 feature support is weak or not well implemented. So, the game is just as good as it was, but there isn't much of a reason to come back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yakuza: Like a Dragon is still a fantastic experience, and it's a game that's hard not to recommend. Yes, it is technically an RPG, but it never feels like one when playing it. The entire cast is made up of loveable characters, the storyline is both heartfelt and goofy, and it's almost impossible not to crack a smile while playing. Yakuza: Like a Dragon is pure fun and does a great job capturing the essence of video games. It may not take full advantage of the PS5's hardware, but it doesn't need to in order to be a great game - and what few upgrades occur in the leap to current-gen probably make this the best way to experience Yakuza: Like a Dragon all the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Someone once said that Shenmue crawled so that Yakuza could run. If that’s true, then Like A Dragon is the Usain Bolt of the series. There is so much to love and discover in the game’s 50 to 70-hour main story. Top this off with a new game plus mode, and you have an RPG that I can easily see being played for hundreds of hours.",,,"Yakuza: Like a Dragon is an important entry for a series that's trying to redefine itself without losing what makes it Yakuza. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, even though its pacing was inconsistent. A lot of the enjoyment is due to the new protagonist Ichiban, his memorable companions, and their relationships, which are engaging to explore. Most of the adventure is set in the Yokohama region, which is a joy to interact with, and so are its shops and engaging side stories. While the introduction of RPG mechanics was a daring move, it ultimately paid off, and I prefer the full-on RPG approach over the old brawler gameplay. Most of its RPG systems are simplistic to the point of almost being repetitive, but it lays a solid and fun foundation upon which future titles can build.",,,,,,,,,,Yakuza: Like a Dragon is a must-play for both Yakuza and J-RPG fans. The PS5 version is a step-up from the original release and the story is as gripping as ever. We just wish that the PS5 version had made use of the DualSense's features and the Activity cards.,,,,"The tale of incredibly endearing protagonist Ichiban Kasuga shines brighter than ever on PlayStation 5, where Yakuza: Like a Dragon offers enhanced visuals. This next-gen upgrade lets you choose between 60 frames-per-second at a slightly higher resolution, or 30 frames-per-second with 4K support. And, well... That's about it. Aside from what we think are some improved lighting techniques, Like a Dragon looks pretty much the same as it did on PS4. The draw distance is still a bit wonky and city streets are filled with low quality textures. It's not a bad looking game overall, but it's a shame that it doesn't do more.",,,,,,,,,,Quotation forthcoming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The PS5 version of Yakuza: Like a Dragon delivers a technically flawless experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For RGG Studio's first crack at an RPG, it's a damn fine result. It delivers what I love most about Yakuza and introduces new ideas that largely pay off. Ichiban isn't doing it alone, either. He has friends and mentors, ones who've helped him fight and overcome personal tragedies. It was an absolute thrill to watch him grow, and that's what's most important for a game so focused on its characters. Yakuza: Like a Dragon is a passing of the torch, and a fantastic entry in a beloved franchise that proves that it's in good hands with Kasuga Ichiban.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A basic upgrade. The SSD helps load some elements more quickly; the graphics aren’t radically improved. That said, the game is still phenomenal.

When the PS4 version came out, however, I found I couldn’t wait, and I impulse bought it. I’m glad I did, since it ended up being my favorite game of 2020 and it gave me a story about love, loyalty, and helping those in need during a really trying time. But I’m also glad I played this game again on PS5. Not only is the experience better thanks to the higher resolution, better frame rate, and faster load times, but it’s just a damn good game that I’m happy to play multiple times. There are definitely a few growing pains in the transition from beat-em-up to RPG, but I have no doubt that Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio will address these issues in the next Yakuza game. And with the way Yakuza: Like a Dragon ends, I hope they are already working on a sequel. Because I want more!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cult-of-the-lamb,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For a mish-mash of genres, Cult of the Lamb does an excellent job of making both parts feel significant and dependent on each other. It's gorgeous, rewarding and made me laugh throughout. As your cult progresses and you move on from cleaning up everyone's poop, you will see your followers flourish. Designing and maintaining your base is excellent and I enjoyed the rogue-lite runs that can be completed in easily in under 15 minutes. Highly recommended, cult-based, rogue-lite shenanigans.",,,,,,,,,,,"Cult of the Lamb is perfect example of an innovative indie that proclaims to be one genre, but assumes multiple identities and delivers. The game’s charming yet disturbing theme lends you freedom to play as you want, and have your actions make sense on the lore-front. Yes, this roguelite is most likely the easiest and most accessible compared to its competitors, but that accessibility comes at a cost of some gameplay, like combat, lacking depth and complexity for genre veterans. Knowing all of this, should you sacrifice your time to the altar of The One Who Waits? To this, we say yes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cult of the Lamb mixes two genres with a lot of creativity and delivers a great experience to the players.

It's one of the best indies games of the year.",,,,,,,"Cult of the Lamb is a game that is much more than the sum of its parts. Taken on their own neither the combat nor the cult management would be strong enough to carry the title, but together they form a compelling whole that's then further enhanced by the delightful art style and pervasive sinister tone. It's evil and wonderful and more than a little unhinged. It's also one of the most impressive games of the year.",,"You will never look at sheep the same way again after playing Cult of the Lamb.

On this, the second remake, it has proven that it is functionally timeless, both in terms of storytelling and the quality of play. There weren’t many tactics JRPGs around before Tactics Ogre, and those that were largely looked to Fire Emblem for inspiration. Now, though, the isometric combat system that so many tactics JRPGs use these days was inspired directly by two classics – this one, and Final Fantasy Tactics. We have a lot to thank Tactics Ogre for, and Reborn demonstrates just how playable it still is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For the most part, Tactic Ogre: Reborn is a good game. Heck, it's a great game. But my run took me headfirst into what feels like the cheapest and most unfair change of mechanics that I can remember in my entire personal gaming history.

I feel betrayed by a terrible design choice and look at the dozens of hours to get to this point as a waste of my time.",,,,,"Tactics Ogre Reborn is by its own merits one of the great SRPGs that we can now enjoy in the best way thanks to its new gameplay and graphics. However, we miss a greater courage on the part of Square Enix with this revision of the 2010 remake.

There are so many improvements, including gameplay additions, menu expansion, display clarity, improved graphics, orchestrated music, and fully-voiced dialogue. This remaster isn’t a cheap cash-in. It’s the quality level of remaster that all others should aspire to. The only complaints I can make about the game is that the story and gameplay are dense, and won’t be for everyone. Every tactical RPG fan needs to play Tactics Ogre: Reborn. And for strategy JRPG fans, Tactics Ogre: Reborn is good enough that it might be the exception when saying you’re not a fan of the genre.",,,Tactics Ogre: Reborn is a more than worthy re-release of one of the most influential and maybe the best Tactical RPG of all time.

It's an improvement over the well-done PSP remaster and improves upon it in almost every way. The story and translation remain excellent, and the core gameplay is more fun than ever. The only downside is that it didn't get any visual touch-ups, so you'll need to be willing to accept cute, pudgy little sprites acting out the serious tense political drama. If you're a fan of strategy RPGs and haven't played Tactics Ogre yet, then Reborn is well worth a shot.",,,,,,"If you love grid-based SRPGs as much as I do then you owe it to yourself to play Tactics Ogre: Reborn. It may have laid much of the genre's foundation but it's impressive just how well it has held up over the years.

Above all that, Tactics Ogre: Reborn proves that the game that established an entire genre remains relevant no matter how much time has passed since its original release.",,,,,"The strategy RPG genre owes a lot to the Tactics Ogre franchise, which is filled with lesser titles trying to recreate even a fraction of its winning formula. The experience that lies at the heart of Tactics Ogre: Reborn has stood the test of time admirably and, thanks to the swathe of intelligent tweaks and quality-of-life improvements introduced, will likely remain at the head of the pack for years to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tactics Ogre is one of the great legends of SRPGs and Reborn just makes an already near-perfect game better. With its translation into Spanish, the excuses for not playing it have ended.",,,,,,,,"Square Enix, which usually makes discreet holes in the water with remasters, has managed to significantly improve an RPG that was already a masterpiece of its own. If only he had had more courage, and had put his hand to the slightly spartan pixelart, Tactics Ogre: Reborn would have been perfect, but all in all we also understand the desire to preserve a certain level of nostalgia. It is officially the best turn-based strategy you can play: if you love the genre, and you are not afraid of the English texts, you absolutely have to make it yours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tactics Ogre is the backbone of all tactical RPG games, and although it's not necessarily the best in history, it secured its place over twenty-five years ago, and now it's possible to play it even without a Nintendo console.",,"Tactics Ogre: Reborn really set the gears in motion for a genre. Since the first launch of this game in 1995, a lot has changed and this title has been staunch in both keeping to its roots and also making some needed changes to modernise the game.",,,"Tactics Ogre: Reborn is exactly what fans could have wanted from a remaster. Though not all of its changes improve the experience, the majority are welcome improvements that help elevate the experience to a new level. This is a must-play for fans of the original, and easily the best possible point of entry for newcomers who want to get into the series.",,"Tactics Ogre: Reborn is a very good remaster of an absolute classic. So many lines in-game are raw and palpable and feel like utter poetry, leaving me perplexed at how they could be written by another human. Re-recorded tracks add to the grim but boisterous realities of the universe’s war. Plenty of granular investment and min-maxing is on offer to create a timeless and incredibly realised tactical combat experience. However, I can’t help but sometimes want more from its vague storytelling and opportunities for more quality-of-life improvements. Concessions absolutely could’ve been made for more difficulty and saving options, doing away with the feeling of hitting roadblocks. Still, this is a genre experience that’s as true as they come. Tactics Ogre has once more cemented itself as one of the tactics giants, and a bloody momentous one at that.",,,,"Tactics Ogre: Reborn is a classic title brought back in this age of HD. It is a game that tactical role-playing lovers will enjoy, being a worthy representative of the genre. It requires a lot of patience to overcome its campaign, but it will not leave anyone indifferent who decides to try it. The improvements implemented are well received because they make it easier to approach a game considered complex in many of its sections.",,"Tactics Ogre Reborn is not perfect but it is a very wise re-release. It's not uncommon to see re-releases that disappoint by being simplistic or disrespecting the original creative vision by changing too much, but in this case we're talking about a release that avoids falling into either of these holes. Instead we have a title that succeeds by delivering the definitive version of a tactical RPG that deserves to be played by more people.","Tactics Ogre is back again, and it's in a better shape than ever. This new edition brings back all the deep gameplay of the original title, adding brand new mechanics which make the overall experience smoother and more contemporary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tactics Ogre: Reborn is a treasure of both classic tactical RPG design and modern sensibilities. I really like the quality-of-life features that make it so much easier to play and stay on the path of the story without much padding. I can also appreciate that this game also contains some tough-as-nails challenges that take an incredible amount of dedication to overcome. In between all that, it’s also just a great story and I really appreciate the Chariot Tarot system allowing you to see the paths untaken at any point you desire. If you want a great tactical RPG, this is not only the forerunner to many favorites, it’s also well-polished for a new generation.",,,,"While I missed it back then, Tactics Ogre was, by all accounts, a pinnacle of its genre when it first debuted. The game has aged well, especially with Tactics Ogre: Reborn's enhancements, and remains an incredibly engrossing, absorbing game with nearly unmatched storytelling and gameplay. Tactics Ogre: Reborn is a masterful remaster of a game that was already a masterpiece. It shouldn't be missed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration,,,,,,,,"If you're an Atari fan, it's hard to imagine a compilation put together with as much attention to detail and love for the subject. Sure, the games aren't always that good but even for us as UK gamers who never much cared for Atari, there are some gems on here to play and plenty of extra material to check out. This is retro done right.",,,,,"Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration is an absolute masterclass in how to fashion a retro compilation, all the while providing both contemporary and older gamers with an immediately accessible and immaculately produced window into the halcyon days of one of the video game industry's most prolific pioneers. This is the preservation of video game history done right and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration is the best retro compilation ever made, bar none.",,,,,,,,,,,"Atari 50 from developer Digital Eclipse provides a proper path down memory lane with video interviews, old commercials, and a cornucopia of information to dig into about Atari’s history, the good and the bad. The inclusion of early Atari games, arcade experiences, the Atari computing systems, Lynx, and Jaguar are just icing on a well-baked, delicious cake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Like any retro game collection, how much you get out of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration is largely limited by your appreciation of its games. There are a lot here, and it’s safe to say that the majority of them didn’t really hold our interest. There are some classics that remain very playable though, and some were worth returning to just for a hit of nostalgia. The real reason to pick this up, though, is its wealth of museum-like content, as well as its new, reimagined takes on some popular titles. They make this a retro collection like no other.","50 years of memories. 50 years of being the king. I love how the 50th Anniversary Collection shows the ups and downs, and exposes the vulnerabilities, of one of the greatest companies of all time. Although some games could go, and I would love to see some DLC. Digital Eclipse deserves a round of applause for this as well. You love documentaries, and you love games, so here's both. And you're going to love it.",,,,,,"For game buffs, or Atari fans, this collection is a no-brainer and if there is any collection that could be considered a must-have, this is it.",,,,,,,"Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration is both a game collection and an interactive documentary, and excels in each aspect. There may be a few hits missing, but the 90 games available are perfectly emulated and serve as an incredible time capsule of a bygone era. The unexpected star of the show is the interactive documentary, filled to the brim with interviews, documents, pictures, and interesting stories all told by pioneers of the era. If you have any nostalgia for this era or just enjoy learning about the history of gaming, check out this collection.",,,,,,,"As a long-time gamer who's stuck in the past, I must say that Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration is one of the best compilations ever produced. From its expansive museums to its wide variety of classic games and hidden gems, it really is the cat's pajamas.",,,,,,,,"While many of the included games may border on unplayable from a modern perspective, the painstaking attention to detail in Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration is extremely easy to appreciate. The museum-like carousel of content, from interviews through to original artwork, is presented so handsomely that you can’t not get swept up in Atari’s dramatic story. And the fact that there over 100 of the company’s most famous titles, emulated excellently with their original instruction manuals available to pore over, adds playable context to a lot of the content. This is just an impressive overall experience that will appeal to those who lived through the rise (and fall) of Atari, as well as younger players eager to learn a little more about one of the industry’s true pioneers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As an interactive museum exhibit, Atari 50 is quite successful, if with a clear point of view. As a labor of love, it’s filled to the brim with everything Digital Eclipse could fit. Whether it transcends “well-crafted curiosity” status, though? That’ll depend on your nostalgia for a library of games that has some trouble standing the test of time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I’ve played plenty of retro collections that either just give you a library of games alone, or accompany the games with a bunch of box shots and manuals that you often have to unlock through play, all thrown together under a menu almost as an afterthought. Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration is nothing like those game collections. I thoroughly enjoyed making my way through each chapter - the videos are fascinating and playing the games after learning about the story behind them made me see some old favorites in an entirely new light. Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration is a game-changer – it’s the way all future retro game collections should be made.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tunic delightfully combines what we loved about games from our childhood with modern day influences. With tons of challenging enemies to encounter, cryptic puzzles to solve, and secrets to uncover, this game will ensure you won't regret embarking on the adventure of this cute little fox. There’s simply no better way to play this game than on the PlayStation 5, with the intuitive Game Help feature and flawless performance.",,,,,,"If you’re a fan of exploration and puzzle-based adventure games, then playing Tunic is a no-brainer. While it does have elements of Souls games, it has more elements from The Legend of Zelda series and lots of elements from other genres as well. What makes Tunic unique is the way it gives the player items and abilities, without fully explaining them at first, and allowing the player to experiment while exploring its world. Retro players who love cryptic NES titles of yesteryear take note, this might be a GOTY contender for you.",,,,,,,"Tunic on PS5 is fantastic. Charming level design, creative puzzles, surprising challenges, along with a lush world to explore and decipher all merge to create one of the best adventure games in recent memory.

It's a cohesive, satisfying game that scratches an old school action-adventure itch, going above and beyond with subversive, cerebral puzzles. It maybe goes on a touch longer than it needs to, but this little gem of a game punches above its weight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tunic can appeal equally to those seeking a solid challenge, and those who want to be able to cruise through the experience.

returnal,"The more you learn about Selene across the game’s gripping campaign, the easier it is to relate to or agree with her observation that “I deserve to be here.”",,,"Returnal is by turns a gloriously dynamic action game and a dark slice of psychological horror. [Issue#259, p.106]","Whether the story pays off is up to personal interpretation (for me, it did not) but putting that aside, Returnal’s general lack of persistence, enthusiasm for negative items, and heavy focus on twitch skill without options for self-regulating difficulty results in an experience that caters to a very, very specific type of player and coldly shrugs off the rest. With some rebalancing and a few tweaks, it’s not hard to imagine Returnal as one of the year’s best thanks to its fantastic controls, intuitive physics and beautiful graphics. But as it stands? My guess is that most people will abandon Selene to her inhospitable time loop long before the credits roll.",,"Due to it's Rogue-like structure, Returnal is a hard game to get into as it requires a lot of trial and error to get comfortable with. But thanks to its mysterious setting, fun gameplay, fantastic use of DualSense technology and superb audio and visual design, you will be satisfied when you finally tackle all the challenges.","Returnal is as bold as it is relentless. Taking the best of Rogue-lite mechanics, third person shooting and foreboding sci-fi atmosphere; Housemarque have delivered an evolution of their excellent pedigree while masterfully demonstrating what the PS5 can do. While the notable difficulty will be a test for some, conquer it and you will be rewarded with a game that is slick, ruthless, and dangerously addictive.","Roguelikes can be divisive, I know - but that shouldn't deter you from playing what is an excellent PS5 exclusive and most definitely, it's biggest game in 2021 so far.",Returnal is a must-play and a first perfect true next-gen experience that utilizes all that Sony has marketed for its new console. A sci-fi third-person shooter that uses its roguelite attribute in combination with its time loop story that surprises with its originality and surpasses the expectations by far.,"Returnal is a punishing game which revels in the brutality of its challenge – and given the randomness baked in to the roguelike conceit, it doesn’t always feel like a fair one. Extreme difficulty spikes abound and ultimately twitch-like reflexes will only get you so far; the success or otherwise of any given run can often depend on which weapon types, buff-bestowing artefacts or consumables appear early on. I managed to blitz through one of the game's six biomes, boss-fight and all, at the first attempt thanks to a fortuitous combination of auto-healing augmentations and a launcher blessed with homing ammunition. Conversely, soldiering on with a sub-optimal build can be a dispiriting struggle.",,"Returnal is a masterclass in how to create gripping, exhilarating arcade action and feels like the first game to truly realise the PS5's potential. It uses everything the system offers to craft an experience completely unlike anything else available today at this budget. Apart from narrative missteps, Housemarque's latest is flawless and a game that everyone who owns a PS5 and every gamer should experience at some point. I hope this is the start of a new, prosperous franchise for PlayStation and Housemaque.",,Housemarque successfully pulls off what made their arcade games so addictive into a beautifully crafted 3D mysterious world.,"Returnal mixes the peculiarities of roguelike with continuous progress that rewards the efforts and dedication of the player, with an enigmatic story that will keep us prisoners of that house that we will visit (or not) in each new attempt. Perhaps it fails in trying to offer an experience like infinite roguelike.","Returnal masterfully makes use of the technical possibilities of the PS5 and succeeds in creating an immersive gaming experience that has rarely been seen before. The end result is a rock-solid game that is not for the faint-hearted, but has raised the bar just that little bit higher for all the games to come.",Returnal is one of the surprises of this 2021. Housemarque creates a strong shooter that demonstrates the capabilities of PS5.,,"I have thoroughly enjoyed playing Returnal so far and its unique die-and-start-over mechanic, excellent graphics, gameplay and sound all work brilliantly to deliver yet another fantastic first-party exclusive for the PS5.","I think that if you were one of those who recently made the enormous expense to buy a PlayStation 5, you must have Returnal among your priorities, because it is precisely software that gives the hardware a sense of existence. It is useless to have all those capabilities without games that make the most of it. Housemarque's work has rekindled hope for what the developers will present to us in the future. The truth is that anxiety invades me because I already know what else has been prepared for us and more than anything else, it adds some flavor to this new generation that, as I already told you, had a strange beginning in large part due to the complicated situation that It surrounded us and continues to surround us to this day. Returnal is a celebration of the modernity and sophistication of the medium.",,"Returnal is an excellent video game flirting with perfection. It has the most satisfying gameplay loop Housemarque has crafted to date, which says a lot considering the studio's pedigree. If PlayStation's other PS5 exclusives feel even half as satisfying as Returnal does, fans are in for one hell of a console generation.",Housemarque’s Returnal is a brutal rogue-lite that constantly keeps the fun coming through its well-thought-through item system that is exquisitely balanced and its randomized gameplay design that feels fresh after every death. Definitely a must-have game for the PlayStation 5.,"At its core, Returnal is one of the most satisfying third-person shooters I’ve played - it’s Hades via Vanquish. It forces you to meet it at its tempo and doesn’t relent. It makes Doom Eternal seem like Baby’s First Shooter. It’s gorgeous, frenetic, and endlessly replayable. I just wish success wasn’t so tied to fortune and misfortune, which only exacerbates any frustrations you have when repeatedly trekking through areas you’ve already beaten. Even after the credits rolled, I felt satisfied, but that satisfaction was also mixed with relief - the ordeal was finally over and the chiropractor's elbow has been removed from the small of my back.","Returnal can be messy, tough, and perhaps a little too uncompromising for a $70 game. And yet, despite the moments of pad-clenching exasperation, it remains a moreish experience even after you’ve plummeted its depths.","I do admire Returnal. From aesthetics and atmosphere, through to its structure, this is a game that is confident, and even brave in the “blockbuster” space that it will be playing in. You can see that the team at Housemarque had a creative vision and were prepared to lose players over it, in return for delivering a purity of that vision. And as a result, this is the first original PlayStation 5 title that I’ve found compelling, given that Demon’s Souls was a remake. When I look at why I find it compelling, it’s for the effectiveness of the horror and the slick vision for action games that it offers. Scratch beneath that surface and the game doesn’t say much to justify its existence, and it is going to be far too challenging for a lot of players, but within its fairly narrow scope, for the audience that it was made for, Returnal is going to be a vividly entertaining ride.","People who love hard video games will find a lot to praise in Returnal, but the haunting beauty of Atropos is surrounded by a harsh environment that will overwhelm those who can't keep up.",,"Returnal's constant action and clever semi-procedural structure make it an engaging adventure, not to mention a visually stunning one. The lack of any difficulty levels may unfortunately exclude less experienced gamers, but anyone who doesn't mind dying a bunch of times will thoroughly enjoy themselves.","Given that Returnal was not amongst the most anticipated upcoming games of 2021, carrying a sort of underdog label, it is a massive surprise. Housemarque has carried out its most ambitious project and, although it has slight shortcomings, it is one of the games that best use the DualSense and PS5 characteristics, thus becoming an essential pick for both shooters and roguelikes fans alike. And, of course, it's very addictive.","An unobvious reinforcement of PlayStation’s range of exclusives. You can love Returnal, you can hate it, the feelings can even be simultaneous. Even though it’s tough love, there’s something about this game that makes you scream into a pillow and then try again. And again. And again. [07/2021, p.44]",,Returnal is a thrilling sci-fi action romp that suffers from a lack of scale at times.,"Returnal is unambiguously and thoroughly an outstanding game. Mixing the RPG progression and ever-evolving suite of roguelite hooks with a frenetic third-person shooter results in a new experience with two halves that make each other better. As it did with the PS3, Vita, and PS4, Housemarque has once again provided Sony with another launch-era hit and in doing so has created a rewarding, replayable, and revolutionary game that’s hopefully the foundation for other future AAA titles that are as clever with the roguelite blueprint.","Returnal is a bold sci-fi adventure, where the plot and the setting co-exist in a very natural way, while everything else being brought to life through unique DualSense features and great sound from the Pulse 3D headset.","Despite certain shortcomings in variety and clarity, Returnal manages to deliver both an engaging story and fast-paced gameplay at almost every turn.","This lack of variety in the style of play makes every run feel samey, and they begin to blur together. That leads to a roteness that made me want to put down the game when I was struggling with the difficulty. I like challenging games, but roguelites need to walk a fine line between familiarity and routine. Familiarity is the warm embrace of something that feels like home. Routine is boredom, and it is poison for a game like this.",,"Playing Returnal, it feels like next-gen has truly begun. The way it seamlessly moves from third-person to first-person; how you move from biome to biome without loading screens taking you out of the action; the DualSense implementation; the fluidity of the gameplay; the phenomenal visuals and audio; all of these elements, and more, come together to create an experience that is truly like no other. This is not only Housemarque's best game to date, but perhaps also the best game currently available on PS5. It's a genre-defying delight that raises the bar on so many levels. If you own a PS5 you need to play Returnal. It's as simple as that.","Returnal is a shining technical achievement, possibly the best looking game on PlayStation 5. With addictive gunplay, a brutal learning curve, and a focus on exploration and temporary buffs, roguelike fans will be in heaven. Be warned though, the difficulty level is not for everyone. Though I learned to love Returnal with time, many players may walk away frustrated.","It's an impossibly slick game that's bound to delight fans of Housemarque's previous work and anyone looking for a substantial new roguelike to sink their teeth into. But for everyone else? The difficulty paired with the sluggish sense of progression may prove to be a major turn off. What I will say is this: If you're even slightly interested in Returnal, consider checking it out. Some games are worth fighting for.","Returnal's fluid, graceful movement and satisfying, punchy gunplay combine with a sense of exploration at once both wondrous and morbid, and a drip-fed progression system that makes you feel like you're always discovering or unlocking something new.","To enjoy Returnal you have to abandon the idea of accomplishment, and stop looking for the breadcrumb trail of pleasing achievements that typically pulls you through a game. Forget about making progress. Forget about seeing the end. Once you do that, you can lose yourself in the near-infinite pleasure of the movement and combat, and the near-infinite mystery and creeping horror of Atropos. Every try is different, and yet also the same. But, with the right mindset, you can find meaning and pleasure in that instead of despair.","Returnal is an amazing game from Housemarque that translates the arcade gameplay the studio is known for to an intriguing 3D world. Gameplay doesn't get better than this, making Returnal a must-play for anyone who wants to experience what next-gen is truly about.","We can say a lot about Returnal, but in the end it is best to understand that behind the gunfights with next-gen graphics and the roguelike mechanics at half throttle lies a Housemarque game: a high-speed arcade that is a pleasure to play. They may not have reached it, but they have stayed very close to touching the sun.","Returnal is so much more than a rogue-like bullet-hell game. It tells a captivating, mysterious, and oftentimes haunting narrative with gorgeous, unsettling visuals and compelling voice acting. It offers a wide variety of collectibles, health upgrades, and unique features to give you a fresh and varied experience with each cycle, and gives players shortcuts so they can continue to press on with the story rather than have to complete every single biome time and time again.","Returnal may have made people think ""this game is not for everybody"", but after playing it, this quote definitely does not make much sense. Returnal is fresh, addictive and maybe can end up being a game that can break barriers for the roguelike genre.",The core gameplay loop is definitely not for everyone but the rewards for persisting are well worth pursuing here. The gunplay and movement feels absolutely divine and the “one more run” approach to the gameplay is certainly addictive and unique amongst larger budgeted titles.,,,,"Returnal couldn't have wished for a better release date - there are no new AAA titles coming out right now, so Horsemarque's new game takes all the publicity. It's pretty, it's demanding and mysterious, and it makes for tons of fun. Hopefully gamers will appreciate it as much as journalists do. A game of the year candidate?","Firsts don’t come around very often, but this is one of PlayStation’s first PS5 exclusives and Housemarque’s first triple A releases, and the combination is a triumphant success. I’m not sure how they’ve managed everything in play, taking the bullet-hell stylings of old and meshing them with the trappings of a third-person roguelike, but it works to a fantastic degree. On top of that, the action-packed gameplay is some of the best around, additionally being one of the most immersive and next-gen experiences available thanks to an incredible understanding of the DualSense controller. Yes, the story may take a backseat, but that’s the nature of the roguelike genre, and doesn’t hinder Returnal in the slightest. I may not be much for roguelikes, but I can see myself “returning” to play this one again and again.","If there's a sticking point to Returnal, it's that it's a big PS5 exclusive that is most definitely not for everyone. It's next-gen beautiful all the way, but if you've never played a game like this before, even all that beauty and amazing design might not be worth the sense of dejection you might feel as the body count starts mounting. Returnal and other games like it will force newer players to ask questions about what kind of games they want to experience. It takes a little bit of weird thinking to relish the prospect of repeated punishment. I recommend it, just for the experience of it. If you're part of that wider audience who wants to give a next-gen roguelike a shot, then be prepared for an awakening. And another one. And … another one.","Returnal combines the adrenaline of a bullet hell shooter, the depth of a roguelike and the allure of a blockbuster game. That special mix provides a gaming experience that is as unforgettable as it is unforgivable.","Returnal makes us feel confusion, excitement, fear and fascination, being one of the best adventures of the new generation. A combination of genres and styles not tested so far that, even with its flaws, works so well in terms of story and gameplay, showing that Housemarque is a studio for much more than arcade games.","With some doubt at the front of people’s minds, Returnal is a shushing finger across the lips of detractors as well as a tremendous example that PlayStation’s middle line titles can still offer as much value and entertainment as its tentpole exclusives. Housemarque achieves an atmosphere like few can and set up a universe ripe for expansion while marrying it to a grind — which is more forgiving than most of its kind but will still alienate some —that’s both brutal and gratifying all at once.",,"Returnal is a difficult rogue-like shooter in a class of its own, whose many strengths outweigh the balancing weaknesses.","Returnal absolutely blew me away with its challenging combat, atmospheric exploration, amazing sound design, and rewarding campaign setup. Housemarque crammed a ton of elements into this experience and everything comes together brilliantly.",,"I don’t see Returnal becoming another Uncharted-style mega-franchise for Sony. It’s just too punishing and quirky to nab a massive audience. That said, it’s a well-produced and polished play that doesn’t really feel like anything else out there at the moment. If you’re not afraid of a challenge, it may be worth adding to your PlayStation playlist.","Even though its roguelike recipe feels flawed, Returnal's exhilarating gunplay, clever story, and mesmerizing atmosphere elevate it to a higher than average rank. Its addictive gameplay loop, gorgeous visuals, and amazing 3D sound create an immersive atmosphere that is difficult to imitate.","Returnal is the first big original PS5 exclusive, a fantastic game and a quite intense adventure. It looks great, plays wonderfully, tells a captivating story and is definitely an amazing AAA Rogue-like that PS5 owners will be delighted to play again and again.",,"Housemarque's first triple A game does just about everything right, with an intriguing story and wonderful world that's begging to be explored. Add some truly memorable boss encounters to the mix and you won't be surprised to realize that Returnal may just be the PlayStation 5's first genuine must have.","But as someone who went out and got a PlayStation 3 just to play “Demon's Souls” (2009), and, moreover, loved Housemarque’s last two games, Returnal makes me rue the influence that Souls games have exerted on the industry. In my view, Returnal’s severe difficulty level does a disservice to its entertainment value.","Housemarque has delivered the PS5 promise with Returnal. All the console's bells and whistles enhance the experience, making this a real showpiece for the hardware. But more than that, the game is a force to be reckoned with; the breathless combat, super slick gameplay, and the subtle but unsettling story combine for an experience of surprising scale. Rogue-lite aspects mean it won't gel with everyone, but for those looking for a challenging, addictive arcade shooter, this comes highly recommended.","Returnal is the first big surprise of 2021, exploiting the capabilities of the DualSense and 3D audio of the PS5. It's a challenging game with well-implemented mechanics and an intriguing storyline that will keep you hooked.",A brilliant game and a very good reason to buy a PS5. The mysterious world is filled with fun action and a compelling story. This game will get your heart pounding.,"Returnal is unique, original and atmospheric, with gameplay that is tight like a tiger. It could’ve been a true system seller for the PS5, if not for the insanely unpredictable difficulty and the overload of gameplay systems that can make it playing it feel frustratingly unfair. Hopefully some updates can make Returnal less unbalanced and more fun, because there is a truly remarkable game here, that could be for everyone.","What should have been a hotchpotch of other people’s ideas, made worse by frustratingly high difficulty, is in reality one of the most cleverly designed video games of recent years, with superb action and endless replayability.","The combat system itself ensures a memorable experience of constant challenges, of which the bosses are the focal point. The difficulty inherent in the genre is rarely a source of frustration, and the exhilarating sense of accomplishment is so present. Unfortunately, the procedural generation sometimes struggles to find a certain balance, which penalizes the time of a time loop for the players.","Complex systems are made simple, by committing their clutter to muscle memory, and play—good play, at any rate—requires that you, like Selene, ride its enigmatic loop.",,"Returnal is an essential PS5 title, now and throughout the console’s life. Housemarque took the rogue-like bullet-hell formula and applied it to a AAA experience in a way that creates something exceptionally unique yet wholly familiar. Returnal is an engaging experience in narrative, gameplay, and player discovery, consistently surprising on every level. Utilizing the PS5 technology in a way that most other developers are barely tapping into, Returnal feels like one of the first truly next-gen experiences, letting Housemarque set the stage for the new console. And like Housemarque games before it, it’s the kind of game that will withstand the test of time, begging for additional cycles well into the future.",,"Returnal is a captivating PS5 exclusive which blends a third person shooter with several cornerstones of the roguelike/roguelite genre in an astounding result. Housemarque creates a challenging and rewarding gameplay delivering in every other aspect of the experience: graphics, sound and DualSense features above all. Then the plot...a complex and convoluted mystery that will definitely capture you.","Dead Nation developer Housemarque doesn't fail with Returnal, but also can't thrill the gaming world with its ambitious Roguelike shooter. Aside from its promising start, the game increasingly disqualifies itself for a more general audience by walking a fine line between being mercilessly tough and frustrating. Nevertheless for hardcore gamers Returnal is still worth playing.","Returnal is a brutally tough but satisfying roguelike journey that is buoyed by its addictive combat and myriad of weapons, items and upgrades that ensure the journey doesn't get stale. Its narrative is gripping and unsettling, its visual aesthetic is arresting and despite a high level of difficulty, it's a damn joy to play.","There is no pleasure without some pain. There is no pain without a certain pleasure. These words spoken by the monk Henepola Gunaratana (94 years old this year) perfectly match what Returnal stands for. The game is far from free flaws, but it offers a thunderous spectacle, especially during boss battles, with these ballets of particles that light up the screen and make you want to be contemplative.",,"Dripping atmosphere and making great use of PS5 tech, its roguelike elements don’t quite come together, as great to play in the moment as it is. [Issue#2, p.78]",Returnal is frenetic and challenging. It takes all the roguelike basics and applies the kind of fast-paced shooter that Housemarque has always loved to make. [Recommended],"I really like Returnal, but if you check the Ars Slack logs, you'll find that I complained quite a bit along the way. I needed a full 10 hours for its combat and universe to click in a crucial, ""I want to beat this game"" way, and I'm still left wondering how many good ideas and systems were left out of this game just to get its sky-high aspirations out the door. Maybe some of my positive bias comes from dreams of a sequel, which might build upon Housemarque's first stab at the genre. But I won't blame anyone for having less patience with Returnal's uneven ambition (or its $70 price point, which, from what I've seen, does not favorably compare to last year's $60 Last of Us Part 2 or Ghost of Tsushima, also published by Sony). But this is the stuff that keeps Sony fanboys drooling: ambitious new IP that succeeds more than it fails while turning the familiar into something fresh. Returnal clearly heralds a new era for Housemarque, in terms of turning the focused arcade-blasting likes of Super Stardust HD into quest-worthy 3D action. Keep it coming, Sony and Housemarque. [Ars Technica Approved]","Returnal gets halfway to doing it. It is full of real, bona fide video game magic, but with each death it becomes less special, more mundane, and this is why it feels so difficult to pick up the controller again, why Returnal feels like it doesn't want to be played. But the magic it does have is transcendent. And so I do still want to play it - whether Returnal likes it or not. [Eurogamer Recommended]",,"The game is freakin’ gorgeous. You get the standard next-gen fidelity benchmarks—4K resolution and a framerate of 60 frames per second—but the beauty of Returnal is more than mere numbers. It’s how moonlight peeks through the forest canopy, or how blue-tendril fauna arcs toward Selene in moments of respite. It’s the way snow shuffles in the wind. It’s the way fog parts as you stroll through buried tombs. Returnal moves at a brisk pace, but I’ve spent long moments just standing still, drinking in the sights.","I didn’t get very far in Returnal, and it’s not for lack of trying. The game is tough for me — and I play “Dark Souls” to relax. [Impressions]","Even after more than 60 runs of Returnal, the enchanting presentation and sense of discovery still remain. I now feel vigorous compared to the creatures that have tried to defend their territory against an unwanted visitor. The last boss only took me one try to beat it, yet I could barely make any progress in finding the right answers. I feel like I’m running in circles. But I’m not giving up.","Though the ending doesn’t fully deliver on the hours of build-up, it’s still a worthwhile tale to explore. The combination of roguelike design with third-person bullet-hell gameplay mechanics is a true treat, keeping players on their toes and continuously challenging them to get better. Returnal can get repetitive, particularly in the second half due to the repetition of layouts and long bouts between the biomes. Still, the addictive, fast-paced nature of the gameplay helps keep players engaged. Holding it all together is a beautiful presentation filled with next-gen flair and spectacular audio design. Housemarque has done a wonderful job with Returnal and it’s well worth living, dying and repeating to get to the final credits.","Returnal cast a spell on me -- awing with explosive combat, immersing with haptics, and captivating with a monumental atmosphere. Not only is it an easy game of the year contender, but it might also be one of the best action rogue-lites ever made.","Housemarque combines many ideas and genre in a game that is, above anything else, fun. It might fall a bit short as a roguelike, but we’ve had a great time with it.",,"It feels immensely satisfying to be sat here in 2021, eons after playing Super Stardust HD on PS3, and see just how far Housemarque has come. Offering a visual bullet hell spectacle, a showcase for the DualSense controller and a rewarding sci-fi narrative woven around the roguelike loop, we can say with unflinching confidence that Returnal is the PS5’s best game to date.",,,,"Returnal is an astounding game, one that easily and instantly claims the proud title of being Housemarque’s best game to date, and is an unmissable killer app very early in the PS5’s life.",,"Housemarque did a great job creating a bigger, more ambitious game than before. A fun experience that PS5 players will love.","Returnal is complex, it is punitive, it is mysterious. It is a powerful act of courage, a “leap into the void” that could inaugurate a bright future for Housemarque or put his work at risk. Recklessness and ambition are not enough to break through, but in this case they are accompanied by a great creative vision, solid production values and a meticulous and calculated design. Returnal does not reach the perfection of Hades, but is destined to leave his mark on the Roguelike landscape, letting himself be played, watched, discovered again. And again, and again ...","Returnal is the most important game for Housemarque, with a stellar gameplay and a ever changing structure of levels. However, procedural algorithms create some problem with casual enemy spawn and luck managment.","Almost everything about Returnal is working towards making it the premier PS5 exclusive. Stellar graphics, a great story, and amazing gameplay make it a joy to play, but a lack of saving and the constant fear of crashes make it hard to recommend at the present moment. At the end of the day, Returnal is a fantastic game, but whether or not you want to risk wasting hours of your life on potential crashes is really up to you.",,"From the moment it starts, Returnal is unrelentingly challenging in a way that begs the player to try just one more time.",,"Returnal is a blast to play, with nice visuals, exceptional sound production and one of the best DualSense implementations to date. There is a significant degree of difficulty that might discourage a lot of players, but the gameplay is so addictive that it keeps you coming back for more.","If you have a PS5 then you need Returnal. The game will absolutely trounce you with everything it’s got, but once the mechanics start to resonate and the overarching narrative gradually falls into place then it becomes near-impossible to put down. Returnal sets a new standard in the roguelike genre.","Being used to fast-paced, visually exuberant titles Housemarque brings us one this year’s good surprises. A game that in keeping its studio’s tradition takes a step forward on a very specific genre. Returnal is aesthetically delightful and has a very important narrative basis, but the gameplay is the true protagonist and motivating agent for its fluidity and fast paced constant confrontations against creatures and machines that challenge our understanding, mainly for the certainty that the failures of the past where not in vain, and that next time everything will be different.","While Returnal’s marriage of rogue-like loops and serpentine story isn’t perfect, it’s a dark, engaging, and innovative experience which provides plenty of gameplay grunt to match its brain-teasing plot. There’s symbolism to ponder, Easter eggs to spot, and tons of memorable moments across the 20 or so hours it’ll take you to reach the end the first time, with yet more to unlock and mess with after you’ve mastered the core concepts on your initial clear.",,"The moment-to-moment gameplay of Returnal is sublime, with a great selection of weapons that each have a wide variety of interesting possible traits, meaningful strategic decisions that can either keep a run afloat or doom it to sink, and punishingly challenging yet rewarding gunplay that is consistently exhilarating. Even with all of this focus on action, it never drops the ball on the story. Its big issue is that runs last way too long, and there’s no way to save progress outside of putting the PS5 in rest mode. That saps the desire to immediately return and try again after a failure, though not enough to grind it to a halt. Even so, Returnal is an incredible roguelike, and one of Housemarque’s best games to date.",,,"Though a much harder game to pitch than many other exclusive titles that come from PlayStation Studios, Returnal has every right to belong in the same conversation that titles from the likes of Insomniac, Naughty Dog, Sucker Punch, Guerilla, and Santa Monica do. It’s a wonderful point of difference within the PS5 portfolio of titles, but in its own right, it shines too. It might feel like you’re beating your head against a very smart wall, but persist, because as you learn to play by the game’s very specific set of rules, mastery will reward you with one of the finest titles you’re likely to play in 2021.",,,,"Returnal is undoubtedly one of Housemarque’s best games and is a triumph for the PlayStation 5. The premise is interesting right off the bat, and the way the game feeds narrative breadcrumbs throughout the game only made me want to continue on. With the tight gameplay that the studio is known for, along with an intriguing story and blockbuster presentation, Housemarque hits all the right spots. Returnal sits as one of PlayStation’s most unique exclusives.","Returnal comes in with some new ideas and finds a way to implement them incredibly well. The game has an attention to detail and a unique sense of style that goes beyond anything I would have expected from this comparatively small development studio. It’s a roguelike with a great deal of substance and scope and feels really good with a DualSense in your hands. Despite one decently sizable detractor in its lack of autosave functionality, Returnal proves to be a remarkably fun and satisfying experience from beginning to end.","Returnal excellently blends third-person shooter gameplay with bullet-hell style enemies and roguelike elements to craft a fun, challenging action game that you’ll have a blast learning to master. The only real shame is that the action is yoked to a story that mistakes being vague for being smart and interesting.",There are many rogue-likes out there. Returnal is one of the best - and the first on a AAA-level. Have fun and don’t quit – it is worth it!,,,"Returnal is a game that sucked me in through its design, and achieves the eerie atmosphere promised from its promotional material. It then kept me hooked by having some of the best feeling combat and boss fights I have ever experienced, which is helped by its on-point audio implementation. It’s a shame then that poor pacing and lack of save structure tainted my experience with Housemarque’s unique third person roguelite experiment. Despite this disappointing downside, I still can’t help but recommend it to anybody who enjoys satisfying combat with a horror-tinged mystery to explore.","Returnal is a fairly forgiving roguelike that quickly shows its true size and scale. It offers an excellent atmosphere and combat systems, with an intelligently woven plot. A solid recommendation for PlayStation 5 owners.",Housemarque delivers an unforgettable experience: Returnal is an intoxicating action game that thrives on its design and aesthetic.,"Returnal is a fascinating mix of genres, between science fiction, horror, and psychology, which gives a much more immersive and scary adventure than what we are used to in a Rogue-like. The realization is good, and the game takes full advantage of the PS5's performance to achieve this result. The gameplay is solid and the fights are intense, especially when you have to desperately survive in the middle of a deluge of projectiles in order to progress further and further. It's a shame, though, that it quickly becomes repetitive, even with its somewhat short lifespan (about 30 hours), with the added bonus of a game design that breaks the rhythm by encouraging us to go back and forth too much.","Returnal is a relentless nightmare that’s a dream to play. The journey is full of horror and terrible discoveries, but also unbridled curiosity and wonder. If you have the taste for it, this is an adventure that begs to be experienced.",,,Returnal sets a new standard for Housemarque and delivers a must-play game for fans of roguelike titles while offering everyone else a genuinely unique experience. The game masterfully blends arcade-inspired gameplay with AAA quality chops usually reserved for a first-party PlayStation developer.,"Returnal is an amazing game. Metroidvania, roguelite and bullet hell mixed perfectly, and the result is fluid, rich and incredibly addictive action. The loop becomes the cornerstone of a mysterious, allegorical, at times terrifying narrative, capable of keeping you glued to DualSense from start to finish.",,,The quality of Returnal makes me enormously excited for what Housemarque can do with higher budgets and modern games. I just hope they learn some lessons here to make their next title even better. Arcade is dead. Long live arcade.,,"With its fast and fun action, Returnal can look like a cool sci-fi game where tons of enemies turn into colorful explosions at a fast pace. That is also how it feels for a while, until we die. And die and die again. Everything wants to kill us and when we die, we must start all over again – without most of the items, weapons, and enhancements we had collected. It is frustrating, yet we can not wait to restart immediately. We want to keep exploring the sinister world, we want keep fighting against all the horrible creatures – and most of all we want to understand what is happening to Selene. The unforgiving setup will probably divide people, but for anyone with an interest in sci-fi – this is a gem.","Returnal the game that combines roguelike and metroidvania genres, using horror elements as spice. Combining so many different types in them, it has managed to keep the aspects that all of them are successful in, despite some of their shortcomings.","Returnal is a tour de force for Housemarque and Sony, and is one of the best games I've played this year with gorgeous visuals, a surprising story, and great roguelike gameplay.","Not the 80 euros system seller Sony wants it to be, but Returnal is still a great roguelite shooter, original and inventive.","Returnal is a great debut for Housmarque on the PS5. The $70 price tag may be off-putting for some, but it makes a great case for itself thanks to excellent gameplay, an intriguing narrative, and replayability. It would be nice if some of the areas felt more distinct from one another and there are a few tech issues left to iron out. Regardless, Returnal is a blast to play and worth going down the rabbit hole in search of its secrets.","Returnal expertly weaves shoot 'em up and Metroidvania mechanics into its base, roguelike gameplay. Though its tight controls, visual fidelity, and intriguing story may entice you to play, the game's almost insurmountable difficulty will certainly alienate a portion of its intended audience.","Housemarque reminds audiences that it’s got the chops to be one of the premier-tier game developers with Returnal. The game is wholly difficult with a roster of powerful enemies and bosses to overcome, but also gives the player everything they need in order to succeed. The game just gets better and better as you go on, as recognizing patterns and learning to adapt is endlessly rewarding. Despite some issues with RNG, it’s hard to knock this creepy sci-fi adventure. Returnal is a must-play PS5 exclusive for any roguelike fan itching for their latest challenge.","Returnal is a challenging, atmospheric and creative experience that boasts amazingly smooth and satisfying gameplay. Add in an intriguing narrative, graphical excellence and some impressive utilisation of the DualSense controller and Returnal might just be an instant PlayStation classic.","Returnal is constantly unsettling and consistently challenging. Its mysterious story and demanding action feel intense, urgent, and fresh. The fast-moving combat manages to appear incredibly daunting, bordering on overwhelming, without ever actually becoming insurmountable. Every moment is a rush, either because you just barely evaded a giant purple laser or because you have no idea why there's an Apollo-era astronaut following your every move. Do you need to be a little brave to play Returnal? Yeah. Do you need to be glutton for punishment? It helps. They say that anything worth doing should scare you at least a little bit. I'm not sure if that's always true, but Returnal makes a strong case.","In some ways, the whole Lovecraft angle plays out here -- too big to conjure, fathom or even understand, Returnal is difficult to want to wrap your head around, and that’s largely because it hangs its space hat on that death loop (again, different game, same platform). If you’re a glutton for punishment, don’t mind a grind and will happily deal with unfathomable RNG forces at cosmic play, you will absolutely get something out of Returnal, but if like me, every time you die, a little piece of the part of you that wants to play more, dies too, then you might find yourself not return(al)ing to this in a hurry.","Other games may employ similar mechanics in the future, but Returnal should always be remembered as one of the ones that did it first, and, as of now, did it best.","Returnal is a game that comes at a time when PS5 owners are starved for a new title. It will do really well, but I wonder how many people will stick with it due to the roguelike nature. The launch issues are also causing problems with losing runs, which are overly long and really defeating when lost. Still it did something very few games of its type manage to do, it got me to really enjoy the genre. I loved playing Returnal and I would definitely love a linear-progression version of it, but am perfectly satisfied jumping back in just to play because it feels so good. I hope they make some quality of life changes over time and really bring this game home. As it stands this is a great roguelike experience that can deliver many hours of entertainment if you don’t mind recycling that fun over and over.","Returnal is a tightly designed roguelike with some of the best gameplay the genre can provide, and it's the first game since Demon's Souls to provide a reason to own a PS5. If you’re looking for an experience that really takes advantage of the latest console hardware, Returnal offers it and a lot more.",,,"Returnal is a winning combination of big-budget production value and creative, genre-spanning gameplay that’s usually reserved for cult indie hits. It tells a haunting sci-fi story that thematically justifies its cyclical, roguelite setup. Demanding action combined with a lack of viable build options turn too many runs into frustrating nonstarters, but a compelling mystery and fast-paced action always provide a strong reason to die and try again.","The result is a game that has everything I wanted to love, but when the stakes are this high, unfair design is unforgivable. No doubt some PS5 owners will love the gauntlet that Returnal offers – the satisfaction of progress, when it all clicks together, can be excellent. But it’s not a game that respects your time. So I’ll just go back and play Hades instead – a game made retroactively even better now that its greatest strengths have been laid bare by Returnal's shortcomings.","Returnal misinterprets the incremental progress integral to the success of the roguelite. These games are supposed to carry a level of frustration and feel difficult early on in order to challenge players. But Roguelites are supposed to carry a glimmer of hope: Next time will be easier. Next time I'll be stronger. All too often, Returnal denies players that hope and that makes it difficult to keep going when it feels like all is lost. The game is about being stuck in a time loop, but it's not supposed to feel like I'm actually stuck in a time loop.","Returnal is not a system seller. (Damn thing’s $500, so what could live up to that?) But it is bold, cool, and fearless, full of shocking moments and highly addictive systems. (I haven’t even dipped into the game’s obsessive focus on risk and reward, constantly daring you to take a debilitating weakness in exchange for a much-needed dose of power.) If you already own one of Sony’s big white bookends, though, I’ll be blunt: You probably owe it to yourself to check out the first really great PlayStation 5 game.",,"A perfect example of the performance of the PS5 and all its functions. Great gameplay and the music catches and won't let go until you get to the bottom of it all. But in the end, the final may surprise you unpleasantly.",,"Barring a sci-fi horror tale that doesn't quite nail the slow building reveal, Housemarque has absolutely succeeded with their fusion of third-person shooting and roguelike elements in Returnal, one of my personal favorite PlayStation 5 titles so far.","Returnal makes the most of the capabilities of PlayStation 5, offering a daring title based on the rogue-like genre with tinges of bullet hell in which both its story and its challenging gameplay will keep its players hooked for hours.","In a genre where déjà vu is more of a feature than a bug, it makes sense that Returnal doesn’t feel any pressure to disguise its genealogy. And yet, Housemarque’s masterpiece — without question the best and most promising game of the brand-new console generation for the time being — takes things a step further by weaponizing that eerie sense of recognition against the player and protagonist alike.",,,,"Returnal is an unrelenting and unforgiving challenge for the ages, but it still captures the magic of what makes Housemarque so special. It has a weirdly unique style and substance, every level is an unpredictable white-knuckle ride and it fully commits to its rogue-like influences. The end result isn’t just a showcase title for what the PS5 is capable of, it’s a thrilling mix of arcade bullet-hell gaming with precision thrill power.",,,,"Returnal has everything you’d expect from an exclusive that comes early in a console’s life-cycle. It shows off everything PS5 has to offer, while delivering a solid roguelike experience. [Issue#254, p.54]",The more pressing problem: the second zone isn't that interesting. But the shooting is good. Really good. I just don't know how long that'll last. [10-Hour Impressions],"I'm torn. On the one hand, Returnal is one of the best third-person shooters you'll find, full of the kind of frantic, precise action that's so satisfying to master, but on a scale and with a sense of atmosphere that's far beyond anything Housemarque has done before. On the other, the ill-conceived idea to make it a roguelike sits at odds with everything the game does best, undermining its greatest strengths and turning an exciting game into a tedious and frustrating one. If you've got the patience for it, this is an adventure that's absolutely worth taking, but I can't help but wonder how incredible Returnal could be if it didn't keep getting in its own way.",The game’s blend of an original Metroid-style progression system with a rogue-lite and a bit of Alien thrown in with the unknown nature of the world makes Returnal a compelling experience at all times. It looks and sounds great and controls like a dream – although it would be nice if gyroscopic aiming was added in later on for a bit more intuitive control.,,,,,,,,,,"Housemarque has managed to do the impossible by crafting a solid story that fits within the tight confines of a roguelite. Mixing the studio’s signature fast-paced arcade action with an atmospheric environment, Returnal gets its claws into you early on and refuses to let go, instantly putting it up among the first true next-gen experiences of this generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chivalry-2,,,,,,,,"Chivalry 2 takes some cues to make the sword and shield combat feel a touch more accessible. I feel it's for the better with a fairly decent tutorial leading you right into the fighting. Whilst it can feel daunting, I've seen myself contributing to battles very quickly. The combat is deep with an importance on positioning and timing. It is slightly undermined by trying to keep the players together but, even if duels are harder to come by, the chaos of a full battlefield is hard to ignore. It's fascinating, fun and fluid.",,,,,"Chivalry 2 prides itself on its chaotic, yet comedic world. It’s a glorious battle cry for gaming, with its spectacularly vicious combat, amazingly detailed maps and particularly awesome performance on PlayStation 5. An early contender for Game of the Year for sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Chivalry 2 doesn’t necessarily feel like a totally new game, but it brings a lot of little changes that make it feel like a fresh experience. While there are still a few kinks to be worked out, Chivalry 2 brings everything that I loved from the first game and takes it to the next level in an incredibly fun and addicting experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Chivalry 2 is a beautiful, hilarious, and surprisingly deep medieval brawler. If only it offered a few more modes or dynamic battlefield movement, this could be a classic for the ages.",,,"Chivalry II is one of the best online multiplayer games I’ve ever played, it’s as simple as that.",,,,,,,"Chivalry 2 marries ridiculously violent melee combat to a tone that completely undercuts any notion that the mayhem should be taken seriously. With that out of the way, it provides accessible but ultimately challenging swordplay and the promise of nearly endless multiplayer fun. It doesn’t try to do everything, but instead picks a lane and absolutely owns it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite a slight lack of content at launch, we can only invite you to take up arms.",,,,,,,,,,"Pressure mounts thanks to player counts – 64 players at the top end, with 40-plus in other modes (and a huge free-for-all mode too). Neat DualSense features add pleasant friction, like your p guard being harder to use the less stamina you have. Not every map and mode is a winner, but it looks fab and is fun, with a nice sense of humour. [Issue#3, p.155]",,,,,,,,,,,,"The melee combat may not be as technical or strategic as some hardcore fans might like, yet it’s hard to deny the appeal of Chivalry 2’s dismembering deathmatches. Those first few sieges are truly enthralling as watch waves of red and blue troops smash against each other. Over time it may lose its edge though Chivalry 2 is still one of the most fun and unique multiplayer games out there.","Chivalry 2 brings out the hero in all of us as we race towards death with our friends by our side. There’s something about the chaos and immersion that draws you in for hours. Thankfully the servers held up across matches full of battle cries and deaths at the hands of my allies. There’s never a dull moment, no matter your skill level.",,"Chivalry 2 is an immersive, chaotic, gory, hilarious, carnage spilling thrill ride of a game which will have you storming castles like a true knight of old one moment, before bewildering you with someone beating you down with a loaf of bread. It’s a fantastically enjoyable experience which is unfortunately held back by a light content offering and some technical as well as balance issues. While this knight may have taken an arrow to the knee, it battles on to launch a cabbage at you another day.",,,,"Despite some uncertainty both on the playful and on the technical level, Chivalry 2 therefore proves to be able to conquer both the old-fashioned fans and the new recruits, among the jerseys of a satisfying, multifaceted and more tactical gameplay than the light-hearted nature of the production do not imply.",,,,,,,,,,,"I am having a ton of fun with Chivalry 2. The maps, outside of a few balance issues, are a total blast – everything from the shining armor to the soaring castle walls looks great and there are a huge range of objectives to keep things interesting. Whether I'm swinging a sword or plucking away with a bow, combat hits that elusive sweet spot between accessible dumb fun and rewarding, skill-based mechanics where the wheat is separated from the chaff. When you respawn and everyone around you is spamming the battle cry button as you rush headlong into certain death, you just know you're in for a rockin' time. I don't think I'll be putting away this sweaty coat of mail for a good while.",,,,,,,"To be honest, I was taken off guard by how much fun I've had with Chivalry 2 so far. It scratches a very specific itch, and while I probably won't be signing on every night for the rest of the year, I have found myself loading the game up to play a few matches and hone my skills with the war club. The combat is the highlight for sure, but Chivalry 2's unique brand of slapstick and gore elevates it from being a straightforward medieval simulation game. By focusing on nailing the moment-to-moment fighting, it allows for player experimentation and roleplaying, rewarding those who want to have fun above those who take themselves too seriously.",,,,,,"The multiplayer action of Chivalry 2 has depth, replayability and, most importantly, it's fun. Torn Banner Studios have built upon the success of the original to create a game that could have a lasting impact on the gaming landscape. However, there is a distinct lack of variety in other modes and many key features are missing in regards to quality of life and accessibility. Modern multiplayer games are an everchanging experience, regular support and updates is a promise that the developers need to keep. Perhaps in a few months, the game will be in a better state with the inclusion of new modes, added customization and a greater parity between platforms.",,"Chivalry 2 has achieved its goal: while not perfect, it offers a great combat system that it's easy to learn but difficult to master. The game never takes itself too seriously and really shines using its best weapons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spot rusting aside, Chivalry II's got heart, humour and has polished those combat fundamentals to a high sheen.

Despite the 30 year absence, not a step was missed, as Return is just as funny as its predecessors and seeing Elaine, LeChuck, Stan, and the rest of the gang together again is rather bittersweet. Charming characters – old and new alike, great dialogue, fun puzzles, an intuitive hint system, and a story which sees Guybrush visit multiple islands, all blend to make Return everything I had hoped for. I’m glad that I was able to finally uncover the secret of Monkey Island.",,,,,,,,,,"Still the new art direction will not be to everyone’s liking, and it remains one of the compromises made by the developers to ensure that Return to Monkey Island is relevant for 2022.

It has some minor shortcomings, but overall, it is once more a shiny standard of how good adventures should play and feel.",,,,,"Ultimately, with Return to Monkey Island, original creators Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman have not only crafted a loving throwback to a genre they helped popularise, they've also reinvigorated it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The return is mostly triumphant, as it feels like the series has never been away.

This is an excellent return, to say the least, and I can only hope this is the beginning of a new age that Terrible Toybox will be leading from the front.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Like the older but wiser cast of characters, the puzzling gameplay has matured, taxing your wits, but not your patience, never leaving you so bogged down with frustration that you can’t enjoy the comedy.

crusader-kings-iii,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There is absolutely nothing like Crusader Kings III on console. By including such deeply embedded and emergent role-playing elements in Crusader Kings III and thus making it much more approachable than any of its more decidedly hardcore strategy predecessors as a result, Paradox have also created something of a gateway to bring traditionally non-strategy fans into the genre at large. Oh and it's basically a Game of Thrones simulator to boot. Which is nice.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Bringing this game to consoles turned it into the most beginner-friendly and fastest-loading version of Crusader Kings yet.

When you start a campaign in this one, you’re going to need to settle in for the long haul, and in the initial stages, where you’ll make mistakes (and often not understand why), it can all be too overwhelming and you’ll give up on it. That’s fine if you decide on that basis that the game isn’t for you. It’s not for everyone and it’s certainly not Civilization. However, there’s no other way this game could have been made, and when it all finally clicks, the depth and intelligence of what Crusader Kings III offers also make it impossible to put down. You’re not going to find a more complex strategy game, nor a more rewarding one, on consoles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,One of the greatest strategy games of the latest years finally arrives to console.

Insanely deep, the new nugget from Swedish developers Paradox takes strategy and RPG to the top. With the exception of an often errant artificial intelligence and a DLC policy that will not please everyone, this episode benefits from a remarkable interface, insane content and a much more pleasant visual approach. than previously. Each part is a discovery and leads to sometimes unsuspected decisions. And for the first time, the series has a tutorial and many contextual guides that open it up to a much wider audience, including on consoles.

The scenario is controlled, the characters have relief, with what it takes surprises and reversals even if we can expect some things. Failing to have the dimension of its predecessor Miles Morales impresses with its graphics and has an identity of his own. A real success.","Rather short but action-packed and full of exciting moments, Spider-Man: Miles Morales shows what PS5 hardware is capable of, and tells a fresh and different Spider-Man story.",It may not offer anything substantially new compared to the 2018 PS4 Spidey game but Miles Morales plays great and looks even better. Miles himself is a likeable hero (albeit it with some annoying co-stars) and the open-world action is just as enjoyable as ever. It's a bit pricey for what you get but the game benefits from the shorter run-time.,"What a way to launch a new console: Spider-Man: Miles Morales is everything Uncharted: The Lost Legacy wanted to be but couldn't, giving us a whole new Spider-Man adventure packed in a smaller, tighter game. Better graphics, awesome soundtrack and improved combat make this game a joy to play and a must have game for PS5 owners.",,"Perhaps inevitably, on PS5 the game itself almost feels like a secondary concern to the tech demo but developers Insomniac deserve credit for delivering an experience at once both familiar enough to appeal to fans of the first game but also with a strong identity of its own.",,"A stunning and must-have PlayStation 5 launch title, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a beautifully digestible superhero yarn that not only maintains the formula of its 2018 predecessor, but which also lays down an enticing blueprint for a full blown sequel to follow.

And for those that love a fresh, modern take on superhero storytelling, this is a brilliant exclusive game for Sony.",Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a great sequel to the 2018's Spider-Man game and a pretty good demo of some of the PS5's capabilities.,"We probably would have preferred a $40 price point for what’s included in Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales but at $50 it’s still a great buy, and also one of the cheapest launch PS5 releases. So if you were disappointed by Avengers and were waiting for the return of Spidey, it’s time to suit up with Harlem’s newest hero.","Spider-Man: Miles Morales is an exceptional follow-up to Marvel's Spider-Man, even if a lot of the formula feels familiar. On PS5, though, it is a must-play just to see the potential of the new hardware and what it will offer from both a visual and a performance standpoint. For many console gamers, this will be their first taste of steady 4K 60FPS or Ray-Tracing that adds meaningful improvements to the presentation.

This certainly beats Knack and Killzone: Whatever the Subtitle Was on PlayStation 4.,,"Think of it as a more focused sequel instead, as that’s what it actually feels like. It’s free of story bloat, and the gameplay has most definitely been expanded upon and improved. Plus, since when has an expansion looked so much nicer than the game it’s building upon?

It looks sensational and is an absolute riot to play. Miles’ story brings all the drama and feels it needs to and highlights a community outside what’d normally be on the drawing board for a game like this.

It offers an expensive-TV-justifying visual feast – not to mention a tantalising “What Dreams May Come” glimpse at the sugar encrusted future of eye-candy. (Console hasn't even launched yet and I can feel my eyes getting the diabeetus.) Likewise, it delivers super-fast load times and an immersive, tactile DualSense experience you simply can't 'feel' anywhere else.",,"The atmosphere of Spider-Man: Miles Morales is something very special. It is clearly politically positioned and the focus is on stories that are neglected in many video game blockbusters. This alone makes the spin-off look new and different, even if the recognition value is actually quite high.

It's too bad that it isn't longer because I loved every minute of it.",,"It’s jam-packed with funny, heartwarming, wholesome scenes and dialogue. And it’s a pleasure to play. Swiftly and effortlessly swinging through corridors of New York skyscrapers is exhilarating, and the combat choreography is stunningly cinematic. If it weren’t for the repetitive nature of some side activities — such as tracking down loot stashes and saving civilians — it would earn must-have status. As is, it’s still the best game to show off PlayStation 5’s potential to players of all ages — especially if you want to have a terrific time in the process.",,"Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales is a fantastic way to extend the original game, with the same strengths and weaknesses. This game is not already using the full potential of PS5, but it still is a great adventure that will totally conquer fans of Spider-Man with its universe, pretty good ideas and soundtrack.",,"Absolutely stunning to look at and amazingly fun to play, Miles Morales is kind of an improvement over its already great predecessor. The side quests are still repetitive though and the game’s a bit too brief to justify its price tag.","I’d wager that Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales will be remembered as the year’s most ingratiating family-friendly video game. It is a feel-good, unabashed spectacle that controls well, looks great and has a hyper-efficient story line that never tries to overdeliver.","Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is effortlessly cool. The overall gameplay structure may prove samey for those who failed to fall in love with Insomniac Games’ previous effort, but everyone else will have a blast with this generous spin-off story. Great characters, tons of activities, and some epic set-piece moments round out a must play superhero romp – and with the developer on this kind of form, we can’t wait to see more of the full-scale sequel that it’s inevitably cooking up.",,"This new adventure with a new hero in an old environment hits all the right spots. The focus on Miles’ family was a correct choice, plus there’s the obvious benefits of the new console’s power - and you can even enjoy the game on the PlayStation 4 with very few compromises! It’s just a shame that it’s a bit short.",,"A far better advert for the PS5 than its short length and last gen assets might have suggested, with superior storytelling and more compelling characters than the original.","Classic in its construction and its scenario, breathtaking in its staging, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales detonates if it's not surprising.","The developer, Insomniac Games, has a similar storytelling confidence to that of Naughty Dog—a natural cinematic ease, bolstered by money and technology, which gives equal weight to ground-level struggles as to those beyond the rooftops.",,"Marvel’s Spider-Man Miles Morales is the perfect showcase of the PS5, espousing multiple enhancements to its last-gen predecessor while also feeling familiar.

It doesn't aim to step up the open-world genre: it simply desires to stand out as an entertaining experience within the usual constraints, being just a great videogame part of the best Spider-Man tie-in.",,,"Spider-Man: Miles Morales isn't a big surprise as it's a direct sequel to the game released in 2018. The new hero offers a rejuvenated gameplay thanks to its powers, but the game doesn't really feel next gen', partly due to the choice we have to make between 4K Ray-Tracing or 60 FPS.",,,"Spider-Man Miles Morales isn't as good as Insomniac's last, but it's also a nice way to launch your PS5 experience. A great action and adventure game that could be awesome with some innovation and fresh ideas.","Miles Morales may not be exceptionally original, but it’s a well-told, exceedingly human superhero story built on a strong, proven foundation of open-world mechanics. What better way to show off a new console?","Given the circumstances that Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales releases into, it's heartening to have a tale that's so eager to see the best in everyone, and that strives for diversity in a world divided. In that way, Spider-Man: Miles Morales' message of hope feels like the right sentiment for this very moment. It's escapism with a social conscience, a timely, tremendous thing right now. Insomniac's second crack at Spider-Man retains the breathless energy of the original, but ends up a lot like Miles Morales himself - still fresh on its feet, a little awkward in places, but steadily growing into itself. It's a game that's full of character, and a tremendously likeable one it is too.

Insomniac Games has built a game that uses the bones of the 2018 title to tell a new story and inject new gameplay elements. The story may not be all that surprising, but it’s told superbly with a strong focus on developing Miles and his friends and family.","While it does little to move the needle for the series as a whole, Spider-Man: Miles Morales both plays the part of a much-needed stopgap and serves as a technical showcase of what the PlayStation 5 can bring to the table.","Miles Morales is a fun action adventure that bridges the previous entry and its sequel. It keeps all the good things about it, but it doesn’t offer anything new.",,"Spider-Man: Miles Morales feels like more of a sequel than it is a stopgap, entangling players within its web of cleverly refined mechanics while delivering some familiar web-slinging thrills. A heroic technical showcase for PS5 owners picking up their consoles on day one, this meaty side story in the Spider-Man saga has us even more excited than before to see what Insomniac Games have planned next.","Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales expands this series with the addition of a new protagonist. There are some excellent moments of storytelling here as we watch Miles become adjusted to the superhero lifestyle, which is something a bit overplayed through the eyes of Peter Parker. While some moments seem to resemble more of an expansion than a true sequel, the advanced systems, unique battle system, and beautiful environment make this a must-own for any PS5 owner.",,,,,"With an improved look and no loading times at all, Spider-Man Remastered brings a beloved adventure and one of the greatest superhero games on PS5.","Ultimately, Miles Morales is a fun and well-written open world; thanks to a properly conceived development system, it encourages players to tackle even the slightly more repetitive tasks, which fortunately are accompanied by a well-woven main quest. Nothing new for those who have already worn the Spider-Man costume on PS4, but Insomniac is always a guarantee of great quality.","Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales doesn't even try to reinvent the wheel, but it's enjoyable and well-paced.",,"New York City is a fantastic setting to step into the world of next-gen gaming, with smooth, consistent frame rates and the mind-blowing ray-tracing capabilities to carry Spider-Man into the future. With Insomniac Games likely planning DLC to extend the campaign, Miles Morales is a brilliant follow-up to a fantastic PlayStation-exclusive franchise that will likely tempt over many gamers on the fence to buy the PS5, just so they can experience this wondrous story.","Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a worthy follow-up to the previous installment, even if a lot of the core DNA has remained the same. Despite some rough edges, the experience as a whole is one that’s hard to put down once you get entrenched. This proves to be doubly true if you’re playing on PS5 and are really looking for a game that’s going to show you what this next-gen leap is all about. Even though the first game in this new franchise from Insomniac might still be the one that I prefer overall, Miles Morales gives us more than an ample taste of where we could see this series going in the future, which makes me quite excited, to say the least.",,"Insoniac Games has a triumphant debut on the PS5 with Spider-man: Miles Morales, a stand-alone ""expansion"" of Marvel's Spider-man. With insanely fast load times, superb technology, an updated fighting system and a really likeable protagonist, this is the PS5 launch game you should look forward to.","Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a brilliant expansion of Insomniac's beloved superhero adventure from 2018. It shows why Miles Morales is the franchise's greatest strength, while also proving how much of an impact the next generation will have on visuals and performance. If you're picking up a PS5, this is essential.",,"Launch games are rarely remembered as earth-shattering experiences years later, but at the time, elements of them always feel magical. On PS5, Miles Morales has both of these feelings down – it’s familiar and unsurprising, but some of its technical presentation will wow you nevertheless. If you’re picking up a PS5 on launch day, for that reason this will surely do.",,"Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales may not be quite as packed with content as the original, but it stands out as an essential story in Insomniac’s Spidey Universe. It earns its spot as a fantastic follow-up, telling a wonderful Miles-specific story while improving upon the fundamentals of the first game with distinctive moves and enemies. And it’s an excellent way to break in your new PlayStation 5; it looks spectacular, loads fast, and makes fun use of the DualSense controller, the directional audio, and more. But regardless of which generation you play it on, it’s a worthy followup to one of the best superhero games ever made.",,,"Though only an evolution and not a further revolution to the Spider-Man formula, Miles’ journey is full of heart, is riveting to play through and a joy to just kick back and immerse yourself in.",,,,,,"Don’t be fooled into thinking Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is some minor spin-off of Insomniac Games’ PS4 exclusive. Sure, it’s not as long, but the experience is packed with enough new gameplay ideas and design refinements that it feels every bit like a true, substantial successor. Throw in a story that does justice to Miles as a character and tech that wonderfully showcases the power of the PlayStation 5, and you just might have one of the best console launch titles of the modern era.","Cool superhero action in an open world with the star being the aerial acrobatics, just like in the predecessor. While the shortened load times are noteworthy, it is the auidohaptical controller feedback that keeps the experience fresh.",,,"Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is truly one of the best launch titles to date. With the release of the PlayStation 5, Miles Morales stands as an impressive achievement in visual design, engrossing gameplay, and an unforgettable story about responsibility, culture, and family. It's well worth the price of admission for all the fun, content, and interesting story this game delivers. The neighborhoods of New York are in good hands with this new and improved Spider-Man.",Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a solid installment from the friendly neighbor that shows us that the city of Manhattan has a lot of potential to offer new and varied stories of this young Spidey.,"The second coming of Insomniac in Spider-Man’s universe translates into a convincing ’standalone DLC’. Nothing really new in the structure of Marvel’s Spider-Man, but some interesting new actions are surrounded by an impressive technical achievement.","The developers from Insomniac Games have successfully entering the next-gen era and are rewarding us with a second high quality instalment for their Spider-Man license. Miles Morales has completely seduced us in spite of its rather non-innovative side content, simply because the magic of the superhero blockbuster still works very well, and keep on carrying us away without ever getting boring. On the performance side, the PS5 already shows us a taste of what it will be able to do through a game very well polished. Don't miss out on Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales.","No load times. Beautiful raytracing. The PlayStation 5 version of Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a technical juggernaut that continually impresses. It is the ideal way to play the game if you can. Feeling the Venom flow through the controller is quite cool. That’s not to say the PlayStation 4 version is far behind, however. Marvel’s Spider-Man from 2018 remains one of the generation’s best-looking and playing games, and this game’s performance is in lockstep with it. Fast travel and restarts bring up short subway rides and loading screens (they are instant on PS5), and the visuals may not have that next-gen sheen, but the PS4 version is still a beautiful and worthy way to experience this excellent game.",,,Spider-Man Miles Morales is a tightly packed improvement on 2018’s entry. Its engaging characters and fun moment to moment game play combines well with the next-gen visuals and emotionally rich story. If you’re going to pick up only one single-player game to play with your PS5 than Miles is a worthwhile choice.,"Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales certainly does not reinvent the original work, but manages to tell a particularly intense story by introducing and deepening an extremely positive character with a compelling personality. More compact than Peter Parker's adventure, with an elegantly told political subtext and a warm family dimension that you’re going to want to protect at any cost, Insomniac’s game also showcases what PS5 has to offer from a technical point of view, with an impressive lighting system that benefits greatly from Ray Tracing and a world that loads in an instant thanks to the new and powerful SSD, which virtually eliminates pop-ups, while also allowing incredibly fluid action, a great sense of scale and an absolutely breathtaking overall visual impact. Some repetitive secondary missions and not particularly exciting environmental puzzles dampen the rhythm a bit here and there, but at the same time the game does not lack incredible scenes, both scenographically and emotionally. A very good stand alone episode, a must for those who loved the Marvel’s Spider-Man, and a great appetizer for a more than likely sequel.",,,"From its newly incorporated next-gen technology down to its rooted and representative backstory, Spider-Man: Miles Morales showcases some of the best capabilities of the PS5. A short but fun sequel to the groundbreaking Spider-Man for PS4 that’s more than worthy as a successor.",,"Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a clear upgrade of the original concept. The feeling of being the Spider-Man is constantly there, especially when we swing through a technically impressive Manhattan that we have never seen before in games. It is simply a demonstration and a new standard for how open, endless worlds can be built with the help of the next generation of consoles.","Although Miles Morales is a very good expansion package with its short story and minor innovations, it has the difficulties of being presented as a new game. A game that Spider-Man fans shouldn't miss.",,,"Whether you’re taking in the details up close, or soaring over the freezing skyline, Spider-Man: Miles Morales looks and performs better than the first game in every way. It’s clearly setting the stage for a massive sequel, but this is more than just a stop-gap between generations. The struggles that Miles faces and the fears that he conquers to become a hero on his own terms make this short but sweet side-story memorable and meaningful. It’s an unmissable adventure for any Spider-fan that can’t wait for a second chance to suit up.",Spider-Man: Miles Morales kicks off the PlayStation 5's launch by putting you in the web shooters of the titular new Spider-Man in a satisfying side story that covers much of the same terrain as its predecessor.,"Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales will appeal to loads of gamers and I suspect it will be a hit for PlayStation owners this holiday season. While there isn’t as much to do this time around and what is included is mostly recycled, the asking price is lower than normal. Being Spider-Man is still as fun as it was in 2018 (and potentially more fun now at 60Hz) and Miles Morales is a character that is more compelling than Peter Parker. Should the few technical hiccups get sorted out, this will be a solid inclusion for any game library. Anyone grabbing a PS5 at launch would do well to grab a copy.",,,"The world is full of activities and things to do, but they’re super-checklist heavy, and don’t flesh the world out enough. You can knock the experience over in about half the time of the original and while you unlock requisite NG+s and the like, you’re kind of left hanging. Upside down. Like a spider, man.",,"Spider-Man Miles Morales is a wonderful introduction to the PlayStation 5. It checks all the boxes of showcasing the new consoles features. The game is heart-warming, fun, and impressive on all levels. If you bought a PlayStation 5, this game should be mandatory. While it is available on PS4, this version really shows what Sony’s new console is capable of, and I cannot wait for Insomniac’s next game in the series.",,"Another fantastic experience from Insomniac’s serving of Spider-Man. An improvement on an already fantastic original title. In Insomniac’s hands, we don’t just have two great Spider-Man games, but two great Spider-Men.",,,,,"Judged on its own merits, there’s nothing automatically wrong with more of the same. But its status as a flagship part of the launch of the PS5 confers extra power on this unassuming little title—power it doesn’t always wield with the great responsibility such a prominent position demands.","The game Miles Morales reminds me the most of is Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. Like that title, it’s a smaller-scale spinoff of a blockbuster hit, and one that introduces a new character into the mix. Both are great examples of how much tone matters: with the same basic framework, Miles Morales still manages to feel fresh and interesting. It gets what made the original so good and builds off of it in smart ways. You may be sick of Peter Parker, but it’s hard to get sick of being Spider-Man.","Remarkable spin-off of two years old spidey game. It does not bring anything new or spectacular compared to its older brother, but it looks amazing and plays more than well. [Issue#308]","With more complex combat, a slimmer and harder-hitting story, more interesting characters and better performance, this is a superior game to its predecessor in every way except for the fact that there's less of it. A perhaps unintended consequence is that I find myself caring less about a full-fledged future sequel following the adventures of Peter Parker and his rich friends. I'm really hoping we see more of Morales.","Miles Morales is a far more charismatic hero than Peter in Parker in Marvel's Spider-Man and there's no better way to tell his story than with his own game as a PlayStation 5 launch title. While shorter and more compact than Peter Parker's adventures, this quick trip to Harlem should be on any superhero fan's wishlist.",,"Spider-Man: Miles Morales might not escape the sense that it’s just a gorgeous stopgap between the previous game and its “proper” sequel to come, but this welcome offshoot is so sure-footed and self-possessed that it finds a way to stand on its own. This is a game that was designed to salvage the launch of Sony’s latest system, and with great processing power comes great responsibility. Much like its namesake, Insomniac’s latest is able to exceed expectations because of its bone-deep understanding that saving the world starts at a local level. People don’t show up because they’re superheroes; they’re superheroes because they show up, and Miles Morales just got here right on time.","A fantastic superhero story. Miles is an easy lead, and the tight design puts him to spectacular use (and is visually jaw-dropping on PS5). It’s a must-play. [Issue#182, p.131]",,,"It’s shorter and familiar, but the first solo outing of Miles Morales in his own dedicated video game is nothing short of amazing. A follow-up to an already spectacular first game, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales improves on its core design with creative energy and attitude that sets it apart from the original. A brilliant first step on the PS5 and a final hurrah for the PS4, Marvels Spider-Man: Miles Morales is spectacular.",,"Without repeating myself and filling up pages and pages on what this game is and how it accomplishes what it set out to do, let me wrap up by saying regardless of this being a PlayStation 5 launch title, it is a phenomenal game. I’m not all that steeped into the Spider-Man lore but when I finished this game I turned to my spouse and said, “I don’t want another Spider-Man game, I want Spider-Man 2 to be a Miles Morales adventure.” This character, this world, is what I’m here for and I hope to be swinging as Miles again soon because this first entry is something truly special.","The early heroic career of Miles Morales gets some shine in this standalone soft sequel to Marvel's Spider-Man for PS4. Web swinging is still fantastic and the combat system expands with Miles' more varied powerset. And while you might have played most of this game before, Insomniac does an amazing job telling the story of its version of Miles. Rooted in his new home of Spanish Harlem, he's probably the most ""friendly neighborhood"" of any version of Spider-Man.",,"As fun as it is to be Miles, to be the geeky black superhero I have always wanted to exist, the game cannot reconcile the differences between its New York and the one I see outside my window. That failure would be understandable, but what is unforgivable is that it does not even make the attempt.",,"Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is an all-killer, no-filler follow-up to the 2018 classic – and has managed to unseat it as the best Spider-Man game ever made. It takes all of the same core gameplay and fine-tunes it while cutting out a lot of the bloat and telling a better story to boot. It looks gorgeous on any console you play it on, but PS5 users do get a boost in graphics and the added tension on the trigger when you’re swinging helps a bit with immersion when compared to the normal DualShock 4 controller. Anyone who loved the original game will enjoy this, and you may very well come away from it digging it more than that.",,,,,,,,,"Spider-Man: Miles Morales tweaks the original formula not only to fit its character but to show how stunning and exciting the next generation of games can look like. Far from being a rehash, it iterates on what made Marvel’s Spider-Man great and asks the right questions about how and why Miles Morales is different and important. He’s a new kind of protagonist in big release games, and one other franchises should strive to emulate: an unlikely hero whose perspective adds value simply by being his.",,,"By virtue of its smaller scale, Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a tighter, better designed package. It might not boast as many hours of content, but what it has is far more worth your time. If you felt the original Marvel’s Spider-Man was a bit average or too bloated with open-world gaming cliches, Miles Morales might just be what you’re looking for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
control-ultimate-edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Control: Ultimate Edition is the definitive version of Remedy's adventure. Bringing together the worlds Remedy has created under one roof and looking stunning while doing so, Remedy has done a fantastic job of upgrading and improving the experience in meaningful, additive ways, such as the use of the DualSense controller and Ray-Tracing. There isn't a universe more worth exploring and losing yourself in than the one in Control.",,,"One of the best games of the previous generation better than ever. The two graphics options are worth it, and the expansions will delight those who enjoyed the base game. Remedy is in control.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, the current-generation upgrade of Control is a stark improvement in terms of loading times, overall graphics quality, and smoothness compared to the original release during the previous console generation. With no stuttering and the added benefits of raytracing, the latest iteration of Remedy Entertainment’s action-adventure title should make fans both returning and new feel like their hard-earned money was well-spent on a PS5 or Xbox Series X, if they are lucky enough to get their hands on one.",,,"Control was already a good game before Ultimate Edition, with obvious negatives but impressive gameplay, but Control Ultimate Edition in PS5 is amazing: graphically it is in a whole other level, with a very stable performance at 60fps (if you set the performance mode) and a good resolution (1440p). However, the best part is how Control Ultimate Edition takes advantage of the DualSense features such as the adaptive triggers or the haptic feedback.","My first experience with Control was underwhelming due to my base PS4 not being powerful enough to do this great game justice. Now I wish I waited for the next-gen version. The Ultimate Edition finally looks and runs as it should (however, if you want ray tracing, you’ll have to accept 30 FPS) and also offers two expansions that tie the story to Alan Wake. [04/2021, p.34]",,"Again, loads are quick, the DualSense is up to the task (and feels great with the heavy emphasis on gunplay in Control), and the game itself runs extremely smooth: especially on performance mode.","If Control was “weirdness, perfected” then Control: Ultimate Edition is weirdness, perfected and fully realized. Bundling all of its content in one place is a decent proposition as it was supported supremely well after its launch, but the technical advancements are what make this “ultimate edition” so ultimate. Its swift combat is finally stable enough to move at the pace it was supposed to originally move at. The immersive world is made even more immersive with its many visual upgrades. Control was so obviously built ahead of its time as these enhancements aren’t just surface-level touch-ups; they’re instrumental improvements that help this game become its fullest self and the best Director of the FBC it can possibly be.",,,,,,,,"On PS5, Control is sublime. The atmosphere is almost palpable, helped by sound direction that keeps you on edge all the time.",,,"On top of being a great game, with satisfying shooting mechanics and a universe that goes well beyond the main story, the next-gen version of Control Ultimate Edition is a visual showcase. It's a shame that early adopters of the original game can't benefit from this upgrade.",,,"If you missed this game on the previous consoles, now is the perfect time to buy as it contains everything plus RTX and more importantly, it is a fantastic story that draws you in and drives you on. If you are a fan of The X-Files or similar genre shows, material… I have no doubt you will enjoy this. An exceptional job from the whole team!",,,,,,,,,"As a next-gen update then, Control does a decent job of taking advantage of both the power and unique features of the new generation of consoles, especially if you happen to be playing on a PlayStation 5. While the ray-traced effects might not make this a must-replay, it’s still a far better and (crucially) more stable experience than the game has ever been on consoles, not to mention the joy of playing with the 60fps option instead.",,,,,,,"Control Ultimate Edition on PS5 is still a great game, and its enhancements are pleasant - Ray Tracing or 60 fps, it's up to you - even if we could have asked for something more with the DualSense. If you've never met Jesse Faden and never been to the Bureau, it's time.",,,,"Control: Ultimate Edition represents a great achievement. Between its already impressive gameplay and a robust number of performance upgrades, Control both looks and feels like a next-gen title. Sussing out secrets and uncovering the myriad mysteries and suspicious happenings tied to one of gaming's most unique and interesting places are better than ever. For anyone who had been holding off on playing the game, there’s never been a better time to give it a shot.",,,,"The best version of Control so far, that makes good use of the PlayStation 5’s features and leaves plenty of hope and anticipation for a future sequel.","Despite the precision of the reflections provided by the “graphics” mode, we especially appreciated a “performance” mode capable of bringing an epic to life in 60fps. Thus, exploring the Office and the many clashes becomes more enjoyable than ever. The included DLCs extend an adventure that retains the same qualities and flaws as in 2019. If you're still new to Jesse Faden's story, it might be time to catch up.",,,,,Quotation forthcoming.,,,,,,,,,,"If you can get over having to rebuy the game again and not being able to transfer over old saves, Ultimate Edition on next-gen consoles is the best way to play Control outside of a solidly powerful PC. If you didn’t like Control back when it first came out, because it was too hard or you didn’t find the world engaging, this new port won’t change your mind. But if you bounced off the old game due to long load times or performance problems, this might be the best time to jump back in.",,,,,"This Ultimate Edition is the best way to play Control on consoles, with the best graphic quality available and solid framerates. It doesn’t address some of its issues, like the ridiculously large amount of documents you need to read, but the gameplay is still fantastic and it plays better than ever before.","Control shines on next-gen hardware. Whether you're delving into the Oldest House for the first time or are revisiting the facility to get a taste of the new ray-tracing features or 60 FPS performance mode, Control: Ultimate Edition is a stellar experience that provides the definitive way to play Remedy's latest title.",,,,,"For those who've never played Control before, Ultimate Edition is a must-buy.","Control is an amazing experience that is befitting of the next gen consoles. It has killer Ray Tracing features, unfortunately hampered by their implementation, and a rock solid performance mode which feels amazing. The truly twisted dystopian world of the FBC is one that will persist in player's memories for a long time with its strange otherworldly places, alongside its humanising story. Highly recommended to all PlayStation 5 owners looking for an action-adventure with some real depth and fun combat!","Control is a great action shooter game, with solid gameplay and a compelling story. The Ultimate Edition adds two expansions and the long awaited next-gen upgrade, that lets you play at 30 fps with ray tracing or 60 fps without it.","If Alan Wake was an introspective, crepuscular and dreamlike thriller, Jesse Fayden's adventure adheres more decisively to the logic of genre, recovering (from House of Leaves as well as from the Area X Trilogy) a sprawling, obsessive narrative, in a strongly intimate and in any case allusive science fiction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Those who are fortunate to have a next-gen console will be able to experience Control at its best, but even those who are playing on the last generation still have the benefit of an awesome game that has had the annoying issues fixed from the original release. If you haven’t yet experienced Control, now is a perfect time.",,,,,,,The Ultimate Edition is definitely the best console version of one of Remedy’s finest games. But even with all DLC included it lacks the fidelity that you can get on a high-end PC.,,,,,,"Without being a graphical revolution, Control Ultimate Edition's Next Gen patch freshens up the game a bit and gives good reasons to discover Jesse's paranormal adventures on PS5 or Xbox Series. The quality of life and immersion improvements are welcome, but the focus should have been more on solving some of the original game technical problems.",,,,"Exclusive to the PlayStation 5 version of the game, Control Ultimate Editon features Activity Card integration, a natural fit for an expansive, Metroidvania-style game such as Control, making it great for those wanting to easily track and manage some of the side quests present in the game. Another exclusive feature reserved for PlayStation 5 owner’s of the game is its excellent use of the Dualsense controller.","Control: Ultimate Edition on PlayStation 5 is a real treat. Gone are all the technical issues that plagued the game on the old generation of consoles: loading times are lightning fast, textures load instantly, and the game runs smooth as silk. Ray Tracing is also an impressive addition to what is already one of the best games of recent times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"With its graphical add-ons, the stability and performance enhancements, and the inclusion of all of Control's DLC, the Ultimate Edition really is the best way to experience Control--and the PS5's haptics really add an extra layer of intensity to a game that already feels great to play. If you haven't experienced Control yet, this is the best way to do so. If you have, this is a good excuse to jump back into its beautiful, strange, inventive world once again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Not being able to carry over save data is a huge drawback.

warframe,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Warframe is made better by its release on PS5. The gorgeous glittery visuals jump off the screen and improved loading times get you into the action faster than ever. With a wealth of content to discover, unlock and find, Warframe on PS5 is a title everyone should check out and what was once one of the best looter-shooters on PS4 is now one of the best on PS5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s an extraordinarily well-made game that shows no signs of slowing down, and which performs very, very well on PS5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A showcase-worthy action game that every console owner has truly free access to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The PS5 version of Warframe is a perfect upgrade: resolution, frame rate and loading times are better. The real star here is the new lighting simulation, that makes every corner more beautiful, sharp, deep and realistic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’ve never played Warframe and are looking for an opportunity to jump in, then the PS5 version provides an excellent opportunity to do just that. It’s beautiful, complex, and offers a free-to-play business model that offers content in spades without prompting you for your bank details on a regular basis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This current-gen version of Warframe sticks closely to its PS4 counterpart, even offering cross-save and crossplay functionality between both versions of the game. What's new with the PS5 edition are improved visuals that run at 4K and 60fps and added haptic features with the DualSense controller. This in turn gives a greater sense of visual and gameplay feedback in combat and the general action of the space-faring adventure, which is one of the most compelling aspects of playing Warframe.",,,,,"The gameplay loop of Warframe remains the same, but the smooth frame rate and great loading times will be a great benefit to long term console players as they move to the PlayStation 5.

the-forgotten-city,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Utterly absorbing and rarely anything less than completely fascinating, The Forgotten City is an intoxicating microcosm of Ancient Roman society embedded in a dialogue heavy adventure and wrapped around one of the most smartly designed mysteries and sleuthing yarns to come along in a good long while. Occasional technical creakiness and issues aside, it's a deeply pleasant irony that The Forgotten City will remain long in your memory after the credits have completed their roll the first, second, third and fourth time.",,,,,"The Forgotten City looks like the result of crossing Skyrim, Outer Wilds and Deadly Premonition. Fascinating. One of the stories of the year. The Skyrim mod that transformed into a swan.",,,,"It’s a fun game built around a tantalizing mystery, and once it gets its hooks into you, you’re guaranteed to want to keeping playing until you’ve uncovered all its endings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Forgotten City is a project that came to be from the fan mod for Skyrim. It's a game with an interesting concept and narrative, that suffers from weak visuals, pacing issues, and shoehorned action sections.",,,,"Based on a mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, it’s great that The Forgotten City has been expanded upon and given a chance to truly shine as a standalone product. The writing is stellar, and the whole affair is so unique and interesting that you can’t help but get sucked in, attempting to find a way to put an end to The Golden Rule once and for all. Not all of the endings available are particularly gratifying, but follow The Forgotten City through to its true ending and you’ll be left with an experience that you won’t soon forget.","The Forgotten City is a modern classic, an utterly compelling video game that reinvents the adventure genre through intriguing writing and exploration. With stellar voice acting, sparkling conversation, and story twists to spare, The Forgotten City is one of the best games I've played this year, and one of the best video game narratives I've ever encountered. Utterly original, completely entrancing.",,,,,,"Choices matter, both in life and in The Forgotten City, which uses ancient Roman beliefs about morality, ethics, and law to subtly comment on our present-day conflicts. But it’s never heavy-handed and what you’ll mostly pay attention to are the characters and their needs, your own objectives, the mysterious city, and the clever way time loops and puzzle-solving work together. Whether you play it once or try for the multiple alternative endings, The Forgotten City is a unique adventure.",,,,,,,A masterclass in narrative driven storytelling. Every character is important and every choice could lead to your doom. Play it and see if you can solve the mystery for yourself!,,,,,,,The Forgotten City is a thoroughly enjoyable and engaging murder mystery where the decisions that you make actually matter. Exploring the beautifully rendered city is a treat and I look forward to whatever the developers create next.,,,"The Forgotten City would have been a good game, if the developers would have remained in the lane of adventure games. The action scenes are more of a miss, since the whole game was built on the idea of observing and solving puzzles. Although you have other means at your disposal, the strongest suit of The Forgotten City remains its slower gameplay focused on problem solving. For a small group of people, putting together The Forgotten City is no small feat, and they deserve the praise.",,,,,"For fans of storytelling, The Forgotten City is a solid recommendation. Freed from the shackles of Skyrim, the full game tells a captivating story elevated by clever and humorous writing. With the interesting time loop mechanic creating further situations full of comedy and intrigue, settling down across a few evenings with The Forgotten City will delight. We just wish the combat was either improved or not there at all, and the technical setbacks weren't quite so rampant.",,,,,,,,"The Forgotten City is a consistently engaging mystery that I couldn’t help but get trapped in. It features an amazing blend of narrative mystery buoyed by some fun bouts of exploration and light combat, just enough to really break up the pace. It’s a game that encourages you to put pressure on its established boundaries to see what you can break and change. There’s a brilliant web of mystery within a time loop that you can manipulate, delivering some great and clever commentary around a whole bunch of topics. Seeing how far Modern Storyteller has come from “The Forgotten City” mod to this full game makes me beyond excited to see what Nick Pearce and the team come up with next.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A fantastic investigation-drive game that, even with the limitations of an independent studio, manages to deliver a compelling adventure from beginning to end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Forgotten City is this year’s unexpected contender for the “GotY 2021” award. Exceptional writing and wonderfully built world, all come together in a wonderfully balanced adventure game that finds the golden line/ rule between the hardcore fist person adventures of the past and the more modern walking simulators, offering a deep experience for all type of players.",,,,,The Forgotten City does a fabulous job exploring interesting moral quandaries through excellently written dialogue and characters.,,,,,,,,,,,"The power to immerse into 6 hour gameplay originates from the great narratives of the game. Even though the animations and face expressions are a bit clumsy, The Forgotten City's deep story added on award-winning original mode is something that should not be missed by those who love mysteries and adventures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Forgotten City rewards your inquisitive mind with equally satisfying rewards at every turn, making its time-travelling tale one not to miss out on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
valkyrie-profile-lenneth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"At first glance, this game seems like everything I love in a retro RPG. There’s a unique combat and progression system, detailed pixel art, and a fascinating narrative. But most of my biggest issues are in these same areas. The graphics for this release are ill-suited to modern TVs. Progression is obtuse and murky. And the combat quickly wears out its welcome. If you missed out on this game when it first dropped, you’re in luck! It’s been perfectly preserved. But if you’re going in blind, you may be somewhat disappointed with Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth.",,,"Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth is one of the most important classic JRPGs in history, even if it is less well known than other titles in the genre, and this new version maintains all the best that the game represents. Even if one or another aspect seems dated, the whole remains beautiful, captivating, and charming, which guarantees it a top recommendation for old and new fans alike.",,,,"Valkyrie Profile uses the conventions of a dungeon crawler to highlight an aspect of games, and really humanity itself, that often goes understated. The path to our true calling is vague, confusing, and full of trial and error. If you’re willing to persevere and think beyond the immediate path before you, however, you reach your full potential. You might like Valkyrie Profile, too!","In some ways, it can be difficult to be objective about Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth. It's one of my favorite games, and barring a terrible port, there's no way I'd really dislike it. Getting the chance to play it again after a few years really drives home that as weird and strange as it is, it's still an absolute classic. You need some tolerance for the oddities of a PS1 title, but if you have that patience, Lenneth is easily one of Tri-Ace's best games and one of the best RPGs out there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Valkyrie Profile Lenneth is a true classic from the PlayStation era. However, the PSP version was the brightest, especially with all the improvements it received. Thanks to PS5 and PS4 emulation support, it can be played one more time by a whole new generation, with strengths and weaknesses, hits and misses. Its price could be more friendly. However, its quality and replayability make it an option that any Japanese RPG fan should experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"At the very least, the remastered add-ons contribute toward newer players learning the ins and outs at their own pace. With this launch, I sincerely hope the rest of the older Valkyrie Profile games make their way to modern platforms with similar treatment, too, as this is a criminally underrated series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The JRPG Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth is brought to modern consoles so that those fans who are so fond of it can enjoy it. It is a game that has a sometimes tragic story but that keeps the player watching. It is very replayable due to the various endings it has. As a port, my complaint is that hardly any improvements are implemented.",,,,,,,,Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth is a great port of a great port that newcomers and series fans alike will enjoy.,,,,"Most of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth holds up exceptionally well, in fact. Even 23 years after its initial release, this is still an excellent game. Sure, there are some minor issues, like awkward platforming, that wouldn’t have been good 23 years ago either, but for the most part, they’re minor issues that don’t take away from a game with fascinating mechanics that are still unique after all these years. If you’re a fan of RPGs and haven’t played Valkyrie Profile, don’t wait 23 years as I did. Make sure to check it out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"All in all, Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth holds up remarkably well in 2023. The game’s mix of 2D platforming and RPG mechanics wouldn’t be out of place in today’s indie scene, and ditto for its slightly opaque nature. Valkyrie Profile hails from a time when games weren’t afraid to have mysteries, and while you’ll have to do a little digging to see everything this title has to offer, the experience is well worth it. So if you’re looking to experience a classic RPG from the days of yore, look no further.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
death-stranding-directors-cut,,,,,,,,,,"If you loved the original, Director's Cut won't really offer anything mind blowing when it comes to the gameplay. A couple of innovations might please those that found the original too sluggish or repetitive, but what really makes the game shine this time around, is a flawless presentation. Graphics, audio and controls, make this as immersive and memorable experience as possible. Still not a title anyone could enjoy, but those who will - won't ever forget it.",,,"Though the additions to this newly reinvigorated version of Death Stranding might be considered to be superfluous by die-hard Kojima fans, there's no denying that Death Stranding Director's Cut is the definitive version to play Kojima's most recent opus on console, thanks to an opulent visual makeover and a wealth of quality of life improvements. Though still remaining divisive at its core, Death Stranding Director's Cut is absolutely the best way to see the hype surrounding Kojima's most esoteric work.","Death Stranding: Director’s Cut is the definitive version of the game, packaging everything in and adding a whole lot more. Kojima’s unique and captivating journey across America feels like it achieves what it couldn’t on PS4, due to excellent DualSense enhancement and some meaningful updates.","Death Stranding Director's Cut will appeal to players who liked the original, but for everyone else there is nothing game-changing here.",,,"Although the story is interesting, it fails because the missions are designed for infiltration, but the game lacks enough mechanics in that regard. Something similar happens with vehicle racing, that the controls are very simple and were not conceived for a modality of this ready. What is very good is the shooting range, an addition that allows you to test the weapons before using them with the enemy through small missions. In short, with its mistakes, this is the best way to enjoy the experience that Death Stranding proposes.",,"Overall, this is a full-to-bursting title, even bigger than the huge PS4 original. It looks astounding, sounds great and that immersive feedback in the controller brings this odd sci-fi world to life like never before. If you played the original and feel ‘done’ with it, there may not be enough big tweaks to bring you back for another go. But the upgrade price point is good and it’ll definitely appeal to those gamers who missed out on playing the original and now fancy jumping in on PS5.","Who is this new version of Death Stranding for? The answer is extremely simple: for those who enjoyed and appreciated the work of the father of Metal Gear. Of course, it is also a product designed for those who, at the time, overlooked it for whatever reason. If you are in this situation and you are already the proud owner of a PS5, I would tell you that this is the best opportunity to try one of the best titles of the past generation of consoles and find out for yourself why we say it is. so special. I repeat, as someone who spent several dozen hours two years ago with the game, I would have loved to have an expansion the size of Iki Island that would allow me to know more about the lives of all these characters who made me go through such good times, even so. , it was a delight to return to travel these desolate landscapes with Sam Porter Bridges.","If you have never played Death Stranding and are on the fence about picking it up, this is the version to go for. Everything about it has been improved upon, and navigation has been perfected, so if you don’t want to walk 20 minutes to every destination, the Director’s Cut has supplied you with all the right tools to make it faster and more efficient.",,"I got to a point where I was not enjoying playing Death Stranding, but I was enjoying watching Death Stranding to see what happened. For me, it would have been better, probably, if the game were much shorter, because I got to where I wanted to experience the story without having to deal with the gameplay. I rarely find myself in that situation! Even still, I recognize the sheer quality and accomplishment Death Stranding is, and the value the Director’s Cut offers, so I find myself still recommending this game. If you are at all curious, you owe it to yourself to try it out, and odds are, you’re going to enjoy it more than not.","Death Stranding remains a bizarre masterpiece on PS5, and the director’s cut only further cements that reputation with a number of worthwhile new ideas that enhance the act of delivering packages across a picturesque landscape of nothingness. The story of Sam Porter Bridges is overblown and wondrous, taking hold of you and refusing to let go as you’re dragged into an adventure that takes the medium to places it has never been before. It’s mindless self-indulgence of the highest order, and it’s rare to see a game deliver upon its overarching ambition in such a bold, uncompromising way in the modern era. For that very reason, it deserves to be celebrated.","Death Stranding: Director's Cut is like going for a hike through the most haunting beautiful woodland you could possibly imagine, only for a guy in a cinema-quality Jason Voorhees costume to leap out at you unexpectedly from behind some trees and try to shove you into the mud. Naturally, the surprise creates some tension the first time around. Maybe the second time it happens too. But eventually that tension transitions into annoyance. That annoyance quickly into embarrassment for everyone involved. That dichotomy between Death Stranding's two halves has only been further exposed by the Director's Cut. Exploring its wondrous world is an experience quite unlike any other, but it is so routinely shattered by stilted combat and pantomime villains that you'll routinely wonder whether it's worth the effort.","I don't have much to say about Death Stranding that I didn't already say back in 2019. The game remains the excellent and unique piece of art that it is. The ""Director's Cut"" stuff is an absolute bust and I'm disappointed that such cynical ""blockbusterisms"" have been applied to Kojima's work in particular. However, this is more than outweighed by the utterly different tone that eminates from the game, now that it comes across as reflective rather than prophetic. It might be sobering, but it's worth musing over.","Director's Cut is the definitive version of Kojima Productions' masterpiece. It delivers an incredibly pertinent story, with more content than ever before, to be experienced through ingenious integration of the PlayStation 5's DualSense.",,,"The 'Director's Cut' of Death Stranding is basically the same game we once enjoyed on PS4 but taking advantage of all of the technical prowess of the PS5, plus there are some interesting additions to top it off.","Director's Cut is by far the best way to experience Kojima’s latest game. However, if you’ve already played Death Stranding and you’re considering buying the new edition just for the added content, better sleep on it. [12/2021, p.78]",,"My advice? If you’ve got a partial PS4 save file ready to go, or even an endgame file that’s not at 100 percent completion, Death Stranding Director’s Cut is a wonderful way to tie up loose ends. Some of the additions are interesting distractions at best, while others are genuinely helpful tools that provide alternate plans of attack as a futuristic delivery man. The short but memorable line of new side-quests is essentially icing on top. Brand-new players, by all means. Tear into this poignant, artisanal, off-the-rails hiking video game, even if it’s slow at first. And don’t forget to smash that “like” button.",,"Death Stranding: Director's Cut is great way to revisit the game, especially if you enjoyed your first playthrough. And now it's time to go back to the roads most taken with your fellow BB in hands. Unity always beats isolation, you only need to make the first step.",,,,,,,"Death Stranding Director's Cut is a magnificent game, bringing in plenty of new stuff that genuinely improves the overall experience.","Death Stranding remains kind of ridiculous: a bloated prog rock album of a game created by a man with a large film collection, an indulgent publisher and a budget few creators could ever dream of. But out of such ostentatious ingredients, astonishing moments can occasionally arise. If you were looking for a PS5 game that informs us that, yes, near-photorealistic visuals can lift a work in more than a surface aesthetic sense, this is it. The image of the dead rising as twisted smoking shadows above the gnarled countryside is something that will live with me for a long time. It all goes to show that sometimes, it really can take a £500 games console and a multimillionaire developer with an Ultravox fixation to make magical things happen.",,"Two years after its original release, Death Stranding is still a masterpiece, with a moving story, unforgettable characters and impressive visuals. New gameplay mechanics, missions and minigames don't add much to a game that already felt like a director´s cut.","Hideo Kojima is the physical manifestation of the Director’s Cut. Often times his idea of a nice neat package is like having a 6 hour version of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I’m ever so grateful for his presence in our industry. He’s not scared to take chances and make something people don’t like, and more often than not, he makes things I like or can at least appreciate. Death Stranding is some combination of all those things. I appreciate it, enjoy playing it, and on this third playthrough became more convinced than ever that there’s something really special here for those willing to take the time to stare at their boots.",,"It’s easy to declare Director’s Cut the best way to play Death Stranding, period. It looks and executes like a dream, and crosses over PS4 saves seamlessly (to include perfect transfer of trophies). Its improved presentation and gameplay additions (notably DualSense integration) are stellar, and make a great game…even greater. Also, the new modes, items and options are icing on an already delicious cake. Death Stranding Director’s Cut is therefore an arguably must buy for PS5 owners new to the game, a solid upgrade previous players will definitely appreciate.",,,,,"Death Standing: Director’s Cut is the definitive version of the game. It’s gorgeous and runs at 60 frames per second, while including everything from the PC version. The new missions are a bit too light on content, but they round out the experience nicely.","I very much enjoyed Death Stranding on the PS4, and that hasn't changed after playing through Death Stranding: Director's Cut on the PS5. It's not perfect in its overall story and gameplay execution, and it isn't a game that everyone will enjoy. If you can get past that, it's still is a uniquely rewarding experience that looks and plays better on a PS5, and it's one of the few PS5 titles that doesn't demand a fortune to upgrade for existent owners. At the same time, the content additions are a bit thin and don't add a lot to the experience, so the upgrades in visuals and performance are likely the main reason to upgrade your version.","Death Stranding Director's Cut is full of big and small adjustments. Some changes make the game a little more accessible, while others, such as the racetrack, increase the already stark contrast between the more playful and more serious side of the game.","Death Stranding: Director’s Cut must have been the original version of a masterpiece that knew how to never leave anybody unmoved, being unique at the same time. For those who have PS5 and have not played Death Stranding, this Director's Cut is a must for their library. But for those who have already played Sam Porter Bridges's story, the incentives to replay this version are not so juicy.","Death Stranding: Director's Cut is easily the best way to play the game. The additions are numerous and bound to help players make their journey across America much more palatable. If you’re someone who gave up on Death Stranding because you found it to be too frustrating or long-winded, the Director’s Cut additions could be enough to lure you back. If you’re someone who’s played the game to death already, there’s probably not a whole lot of reason to come back given how little extra content there is.",,,,,,,"Death Stranding Director's Cut rekindles the flame for this extraordinary epic tales. The new additions allow this adventure to be seen from a new perspective. It adds new features aimed at neophytes. It is above all to them that this title is addressed. However, Hideo Kojima's teams do not forget the fans through the new action missions and the scoring table in order to push for performance and replayability. We are facing a title that is already excellent in its foundations and the new additions come to strengthen them to give an overall rendering that it would be a shame to miss out on, especially if you had not given the original version a chance.",,,,"Death Stranding Director's Cut is a fantastic port of a fascinating game. It introduces lots of new features that enrich the experience, the graphics and performance get a big boost, and PS5's bells and whistles are all put through their paces. It all adds up to make this the best way to play Kojima Productions' insane adventure, whether you're new to the experience or want to pick up where you left off. It's not going to change anyone's mind one way or the other — it's still Death Stranding, like it or not — but Director's Cut certainly presents the game in the best light.",,"At its core, it's still absolutely amazing, now a bit more beautiful and smoother game.","When Death Stranding came out in 2019 I was in a bit of a conflict: on the one hand it was a great gameplay experience that presented me with something I hadn't played before, but in terms of story it sometimes completely derailed by tons of dialogue. The Director's Cut gives me the same feeling, but I'm convinced that newcomers will definitely take advantage and enjoy the new quality-of-life additions and the DualSense features. On the other hand, it offers owners of the PlayStation 4 version enough additions and improvements to justify a ten euro upgrade should they want to play this unique game again.","It’s hard to believe this is Hideo Kojima’s preferred version of the game, considering it side lines so much of the core gameplay and adds little else of any substance.","Two years later, Death Stranding remains a masterpiece. Undoubtedly always so divisive, the last born of Kojima Productions offers a unique gaming experience, transfigured by the capacities of a PlayStation 5 allowing him to give everything he has in the belly, to the point of pouring into bulimia new unpublished content. Admittedly, not all are equal, but the experience offered by this Director's Cut is complete, can potentially suit more player profiles, can potentially appeal to those who had succumbed to this fantastic and exotic journey on PS4 and who will appreciate to (re) live new adventures with a Norman Reedus larger than life. Certainly a must have for anyone who owns a PS5 and wants to embark on a unique game that is landmark and still upsets us today.",,,"Every new line of code written enhances the original experience, bringing new ways for existing players to enjoy Death Stranding again. Whether you're here for exploring the factory and playing with the new toys like I am or want to challenge friends for top spot on the racing and firing range leaderboards, odds are there is a reason for you to come back. Reworked missions will aid new players into the world more smoothly than the original release, too. I definitely felt as though the difficulty spike wasn't nearly as harsh thanks to this. Keep in mind that while the Director's Cut expands and adds delicate touches here and there, this is still a game that requires patience and time for the best results.","The original game itself is a triumphant genre experiment, but viewing these new additions in a singular lens begs the question: is it worth upgrading? Simply, yes. Death Stranding Director's Cut has become the essential version of the game, even if purely for the better optimization alone. Available for a mere £5 / $7, players who already own the game aren't risking too much when it comes to revisiting Kojima Productions' bizarre hike through America.","It is unlikely that those who hated Death Stranding in its standard version will be able to change their judgment about the Director's Cut; all other players, on the other hand, shouldn't miss the opportunity to live and play again the adventure of Sam Porter Bridges.",,,,,"You’ve also got new tools for making deliveries, such as a cargo cannon, a robot helper, and even an on-foot only, very steep bridge. Nothing here really ousts the base game’s structures, which is for the best as it means the shared network of nearby players continues to stand strong. Some of it may make the game a little easier, but none of it’s really necessary. That holds true for many PS5 upgrades. Death Stranding is better here than it was on the last-gen console, and it might be worth a revisit to see how the land has changed, but it’s not a must-see replay. [Issue#7, p.74]","Death Stranding: Director's Cut changes some of the foundations of the original game. Its new additions soften many of its exploration and combat mechanics, something that some players may be grateful for, but that will create some division within the community. Its extended plot is limited to a small detail that can change the player's perception of some characters, although it is not vital to understand its plot. All in all, it is a version that takes full advantage of the technology of PS5 and expands its content with a good number of activities such as Fragile races, practice in shooting ranges or the missions of Half-Life or Cyberpunk 2077 Whether you choose this version or the 2019 version, Death Stranding is and will be an unforgettable title. [Recommended]","If you're on board with his insane premise, this is best version of Death Stranding to get.",,,,,"Some art will, given time, morph alongside us. Some art will wait calmly, even stubbornly, for us to return with a new perspective. Death Stranding, by my estimation, has done a bit of both. It has sat patiently, confident in its mechanisms and gargantuan in its ideas, but it has also shifted — just a little bit — while we all did our best to grow. So: Is Death Stranding: Director’s Cut worth playing? Absolutely. Especially now. Was Death Stranding also worth playing in 2019? I’d say so. I just wasn’t ready for it yet. [Polygon Recommends]","When playing the original version of Death Stranding, I would have described it as lethargic with some horror elements when dealing the monsters. With Death Stranding Director’s Cut, this opinion was reevaluated. It’s a game about many things. It’s about society and the role each person plays in it. It’s about overcoming depression. It’s about confusing and/or boring friends when they watch me play it. This is a chill game punctuated with tense moments, with a pacing that I didn’t appreciate until this edition. As an unexpectedly-improved release, Death Stranding: Director’s Cut is well worth the time for the curious or the existing fans, proving that Kojima still knows how to surprise.","Death Stranding Director’s Cut is an oddly named excuse to get addicted to delivering all over again. The visuals are stunning, but the haptics and new gadgets take things to even greater heights. Its themes have never been more relevant, and its gameplay never more fun.","This is the best way to play Death Stranding. Some of the additions are great, some seem a bit strange, but that’s exactly what you would expect from Kojima.","More could have been done on the story front, but Death Stranding Director’s Cut is still a solid experience on the PS5.","Death Stranding Director's Cut is not a Director's Cut, it's Death Stranding Plus Some Frivolous Extra Bits, but for five quid or ten dollars you can't really complain. If you've never played the game then you are getting the best version, so it's win either way.",,"Whether the 4k60 frames or the powerful features of DualSense, the experience of Death Stranding: Director's Cut has been taken to another level. With this Director's Cut, there will be some new feelings when going through the ""journey of connection"" again.",,"Some of Death Stranding Director's Cut's new additions are a little disappointing, but the experience's core mechanics remain intact. Though it is an inessential purchase, those who enjoyed the original game and want to dive in again will find plenty to like here.",,"A great game now a little bigger. The new features do not break the gameplay, but give additional variety to the action. The best Death Stranding is here.","Death Stranding makes its debut on PlayStation 5 with a Director's Cut which, while offering players a good dose of unreleased content, does not significantly alter the quality balance of Hideo Kojima's latest work. The playful narrative essence of the production has therefore remained the same as it was two years ago, with all its strengths, its flaws and its overflowing expressive power. With an exceptional technical sector, the monumental epic of Sam Porter Bridges returns to console in its best form, to propose to the public an exceptional science fiction story placed between the meshes of an extraordinarily rich and fascinating imaginary, which frames a poignant story supported by a gameplay as satisfying as it is unique, capable of triggering a pleasant addiction. More than anything else, Death Stranding is the ardent manifestation of the creative flair of an author who is not afraid to challenge the logic and dogmas of the market, with the aim of pushing the medium towards still unexplored territories.","A pandemic later, Death Stranding feels even more powerful, meaningful and precious. A once in a lifetime experience that you should definitely live, to learn more about yourself and how big our achievements can be when we are determined to work together.","Death Stranding Director’s Cut is a game with a ton going on. It’s an easy recommendation for anyone looking for a creative and enjoyable experience. The only question for those who played the original version is whether or not they enjoyed their first trip through Kojima’s brilliant creation. If you did, or if this is your first time playing Death Stranding, you are absolutely going to love every second of the Death Stranding Director’s Cut.",,,,"Death Stranding Director’s Cut brings some additions and gameplay improvements to the original game, thus making it even better. If you still haven’t played Kojima’s masterpiece now is the time.",,"Death Stranding Director's Cut is more than extra content, it's a new chance to experience a title that many see wrongly and that deserves to be experienced by all those who love this industry. Kojima's work, misunderstood by so many, reaches its final evolutionary state, with new technological additions that neither compromise the trip nor take away its meaning. A lonely but wonderful journey that deserves a second chance from those who threw the towel in 2019, with visual improvements that elevate the narrative experience, music that enhances a deep soundtrack, and new activities that drown us even more in an hallucinated America. Director’s Cut is the end of a piece of art that has remained closed to so many people, which is now opening doors again, re-presenting one of the most brilliant works of the past generation.",,,"A long list of quality of life improvements certainly makes the PS5 Director’s Cut the most feature-rich and accessible version of Death Stranding. If you’re yet to experience its gorgeous vistas and general sci-fi weirdness and you’re not turned off at the thought of a 40-hour fetch quest, then this is the best way to enjoy its fiction with the least amount of friction. However, by giving us powerful new cargo-moving tools that allow us to forgo heavily burdened hikes in favour of walking the path of least resistance, it diminishes frustration at the cost of any sense of hard-earned gratification. This may be called a “Director’s Cut,” but I can’t help but feel that, for better or worse, the PS4 original perhaps more closely resembles the director’s vision.",,,"I went into Death Strand Directors Cut, ready to embrace the weird and enjoy the experience. The story, visuals and world are all quite good and up to a great standard. But before too long the monotonous nature of its core gameplay had me feeling I was doing a job that I had little interest in.","While I took a lot away from it the first time, Death Stranding Director’s Cut affected me far more and left an even more positive impression. Regardless of whether someone likes it or not, it sticks with you. Even if the story doesn’t click, the underlying concepts stay with you. And at a time when we can’t easily travel or connect, having this game where you can and make a difference in strangers’ lives online is very welcome.",,"Death Stranding Director's Cut continues to impress with its fearless commitment to fetch quests on top of fetch quests, and again, it's not going to change your mind if you didn't already buy into what it was selling back in 2019. But if you did, the Director's Cut enhances and enriches that original experience, and you'll be happy you jumped back into this one.",,"I am a genuine fan of Hideo Kojima's work and Death Stranding as a whole, but the lack of substantial new content to justify the additional price of entry holds back Death Stranding Director's Cut from reaching the soaring heights it potentially could. There is maybe enough new content to keep a returning player engaged for a weekend or so, but there really isn't anything in this update that couldn't have been included in a PS5 patch. However, Death Stranding itself is a modern marvel of creativity and risk-taking that I consider a ""must play"" for anyone who has not yet experienced it, and the upgrades in the Director’s Cut make it the optimal way to tackle this unique journey.",,,,,"Death Stranding Director's Cut is an artistic vision fully realized. If the original Death Stranding did not entice you, do not expect to be converted. However, if you resonate with the experience being presented, the game is a must-play and the definitive way to enjoy a one-of-a-kind title.",,,"Two years later, Death Stranding is still an atypical and compelling adventure that managed to transport us for more than fifty hours. No matter how much we might grumble about the weaknesses of its creator's writing, the fact remains that its unique concept still holds up well, while its panoramas are sublimated by the PS5's optimizations. So the verdict is pretty much the same as for other editions of this kind on Sony's machine: if you've never played the original game, go for it, but if you've already played it, the new content doesn't necessarily justify paying for it again.","If you've never played Death Stranding, I think you should. Whether it's the original release or the new Director's Cut, the game is worth experiencing. Not to say it's perfect by any means (read Game Informer's review for a second opinion). But there's nothing like Death Stranding. And there may never be again; I struggle to think Sony or any other publisher will ever let Kojima be this free a second time – at least not with this kind of budget. That's what makes Death Stranding worth experiencing. Gravity Gloves, race tracks, and cargo catapults are just icing on the cake.",,If you’ve been holding off on Death Stranding in the hope they would improve it then Death Stranding Director’s Cut is the perfect time to jump in. Even outside of that though I found Death Stranding a fascinating game to be playing for the first time.,Death Stranding the Director's Cut is the definitive way to experience the game and is worth checking out for those who may have missed it on other platforms.,"On the PS5 Death Stranding is as beautiful as ever and this Director's Cut gives players a bunch of new and (quite) interesting content, but not enough to make it feel really new and fresh.",,,,,,Death Stranding Director's Cut took a good game from Playstation 4 and brought it to the next generation in the best possible way. Every Playstation 5 player should try this game.,"Death Stranding Director's Cut is for fans of the series who want to replay this title in all its glory on a PS5, but it's mainly for newcomers thanks to tweaks to the early game that make it more accessible.",,,"Featuring 4K textures, smooth frame rates, and new content that complements the core story, Death Stranding: Director's Cut tops the vanilla game in nearly every way.","The Death Stranding Director’s Cut adds enough new tools and toys for players to utilize to make the experience worth replaying for those diehard fans. And for those that were unsure about getting in, the shuffling and redistribution of tools ensures that the early game is more approachable, while still retaining the sense of scale and progression offered at launch. The other features, like the firing range, racing track, and new location elevate an already rich experience. So collect your order and tie up your laces, because you’ll want to walk another 500 miles or more to experience what’s on offer here.","Death Stranding Director’s Cut is a visual and technical marvel that introduces a number of features that, while not essential, absolutely add to the overall experience.","It is undeniable that returning to the world of Death Stranding after the year we've all had was affecting in ways I never anticipated going in. It didn't strike me the first time just how much positive feedback the game gives for every little thing Sam does. It didn't strike me the first time just how accurate the game would be in how isolation makes every interaction with a live human being into an event. The hope, the despair, the determination of it all just plain hits differently now, and in ways that make the game one to experience even if you don't end up liking it enough to stick with it for dozens of hours. The Director's Cut still does an admirable job goosing up that experience for maximum immersion. Even while trying to nudge itself towards something more approachable, there is still nothing quite like this game.",,"There's no denying Death Stranding: Director's Cut's technical achievements. It's incredibly immersive, putting every new capability built into the PlayStation 5 to the test and coming out triumphant. If you were disappointed by Death Stranding's unwieldy gameplay the first time around, the Director's Cut isn't going to win you over. But if Kojima's storytelling took you in, this will be a worthwhile upgrade.","Death Stranding: Director’s Cut is easily the best version of Kojima’s latest game. The new features and additions are more than worth the $10 upgrade for existing owners. Visually the game always looked amazing, but the new higher resolution just showcases the details even better. For anyone who enjoyed the original this upgrade is easy to recommend. For those that never played it, this is the version to get. I continue to think about this game on a weekly basis and enjoyed revisiting it with the new content.",,,"If you’re a newcomer to Death Stranding, the Directors Cut is the best way to play an absolute masterpiece, and I’m very jealous that you’ll be able to engage with it in all its glory. Some of the systemic chaff has been cut out to maintain the atmosphere while making your adventure a little less punishing, and, as a result, it feels far more accessible than it was at launch. Death Stranding feels at home on the PS5 with its enhanced immersion, loading times, framerate bump and graphical fidelity, elevating an already great game into something extraordinary. Returning players are also getting a lot of bang for their buck if they upgrade thanks to a job lot of new content and lore, providing a great excuse to transfer your data, slip on your Bridges Boots and dive back in.",,,,,,,,"Easily the best way to experience building bridges across America, Death Stranding Director's Cut is less of the final cut one might expect from Kojima himself and moreso a collection of novel enhancements to make this the best looking and best feeling way to experience this unique title.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Death Stranding: Director’s Cut is a solid remaster with smart upgrades that build upon the original release without taking away from what made it a unique experience. The game itself has a lot to say and some of it is genuinely compelling, however, the pacing is abhorrent and the core gameplay is a deadly pill made out of tedium and boredom, that I really wish I hadn’t swallowed. Let’s hope I’m a Repatriate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With a higher level of stability and some wonderful vistas to explore, alongside the continuous qualities in terms of control and combat, Assassin's Creed Valhalla is an impressive title to kick off the new generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"There are two competing experiences here: that as as Assassin, and that as a Viking, that either on its own feels like it might have been a triumph and better than this good but not great Assass-king hybrid we have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla really comes together on PS5. Near instant load times combined with silky smooth performance make it a joyous open world excursion, complete with an engrossing main story. What's more, the countless bugs that plagued the PS4 version of the game have, for the most part, been squashed. This is Ubisoft's best ever attempt at an open world RPG in the vein of something like The Witcher 3, and while it is still a little rough around the edges, Valhalla leaves its mark as a top tier entry in the Assassin's Creed series.",,,,,,,,"Is Assassin’s Creed Valhalla the best entry in the series yet? Some would be tempted to say so. While the map size might overwhelm some players, it remains an easy game to mainline with the right navigation mode turned on. In fact, the quick load times help to make this an even easier task than in previous generations. This is an iteration of Assassin’s Creed that has a bit of everything from the previous games, as refined as we have seen to date.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla effortlessly plants its banner as the best open world RPG available for the new consoles. This Viking epic flexes its gore-soaked, tattooed muscles when it comes to world-building, and medieval England wows with its enchanting untamed vistas. It’s also portioned out at a steady pace and, if not for the repetitive, limited combat, Valhalla could have ranked even higher among our favourite games in the series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"On PS5 Eivor’s adventure is not flawless either, but brings you an always entertaining mix of exploration, story, battles and town development – while constantly looking great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Valhalla is equipped with a number of gameplay systems that clearly echo the last two games and while positive tweaks and light refinements have been made, the overall experience feels overly familiar by now. What Valhalla lacks in originality, however, the visceral and fun combat makes up the deficit and that speaks volumes to me as a longtime fan. Packed with enough content on the disc and planned future DLC, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is another hefty and captivating entry in Ubisoft’s long running historical franchise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The multiple possibilities and the freedom of action at the heart of the various beautiful environments make the game an extremely pleasant journey.",,,,,,,"Hitman 3 closes out the World of Assassination trilogy with developer IO Interactive in a confident mood. Lessons learned from the past five or six years have worked their way into this splendid epitaph for a series that looked dead and buried more than once along the way. As with its predecessor’s there are some lows to go with the highs, but those highs? They are truly something special and make the future of IO Interactive an exciting prospect.",,,,,,,,,"Sure, it’s overly serious, and sure, my experience had a few blips along the way, but ultimately, it allowed Agent 47 to do his thing — and finish up this part of his story — in a way that felt true to this reborn version of the series. It may not be my favourite entry in the series, but it’s a good way to finish things off, and for that reason, it’s well worth your time.",,"Hitman 3 is about the highest bar IO Interactive could set with the franchise. This is a universe the developer has lovingly crafted over the years and a perfect opportunity to let Agent 47 rest awhile. Hitman‘s laughable dark humor is here in spades, as the community devises weird challenges for each other that were never part of IO Interactive’s original plan. There are flaws–one’s that haven’t changed since 2016–but they are merely quirks that fans have embraced and come to terms with. As Escalations, Contracts, and new content trickles out over the months to come, Hitman 3 will continue to delight in its murderous, unique intent. Though 47 will eventually be traded for 007, it would be foolish to not recognize IO Interactive as an accomplished developer, responsible for an incredible game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hitman 3 doesn’t break the mould, it merely beats in some extra details that give it a little extra depth and richness. For fans of the series it won’t be an issue; this is the final piece in a trilogy, after all – if it was too different it would stand out like a sore thumb. Ultimately, then, the only really disappointing aspect of Hitman 3 is its final location, which plays more like a sequence from Hitman: Absolution. With every other location offering so many possibilities, however, it’s forgivable. Chances are we aren’t going to be placed in control of Agent 47 again; at least for a fair while, anyway. But with Hitman 3, IO Interactive has at least made sure he’s had a worthy send-off.",,,,"The final part of the modern Hitman trilogy is a minor masterpiece, a treasure trove of unforgettable player-generated moments. It doesn’t add any new ideas to the series, but perhaps it didn’t need to – because this is a game that lets you come up with the ideas, whether good, bad, deadly or ridiculous.","Whilst nog being the most revolutionary entry in the series, Hitman 3 truly does deliver the best the new trilogy has to offer. With six stunning and diverse locations, plenty of opportunities to kill and all the finetuning, Hitman feels better than ever before. There are some minor technical flaws and bugs, but overall Hitman 3 is a worthy ending of this modern Hitman-era.","Hitman 3 is a good entry in the series.

Direct, effective and with multiple possibilities to think like real killers.",,,,,,"Hitman 3 is the ultimate Hitman experience, period. The game runs almost improbably crisp, and each location is a ton of fun to explore. Replayability is a must, but not just because of the brevity of the campaign, but because there is so much to do in each one. Adding the missions of yesteryear appends even more to the package, along with the ability to be the assassin in VR or take it on the go with Stadia or Switch. I could try and nitpick it for what it doesn’t do or where it comes up short (of which there’s almost nothing), but when it comes to being an early contender for Game Of The Year, Hitman 3 hits its target dead center.",,"Hitman 3 manages to find an excellent balance within the existing formula.

There are some small technical issues, but they're nowhere near prominent enough to hamper your enjoyment.",,"On its own, Hitman 3 is a moody conclusion to a generation-defining trilogy, but when taken as a complete compilation, it’s the ultimate stealth sandbox. IO Interactive has honed its gameplay formula to perfection, and it’s on top form here, designing missions like Dartmoor where you can lose yourself for hours solving a murder mystery that’s largely separate to the events of the core game. The process of puzzling out each level, deconstructing it, and then executing the perfect Silent Assassin run is some of the most fun you can have on PS5 right now – don’t miss this victory lap from one of gaming’s best franchises.",,"This is how you end a trilogy.

The game is a glorious romp through six beautiful maps, leaving a trail of bodies in your wake. The many varied ways to deal with targets means replayability is a joy and exploration is fun.

Agent 47 might be taking a break for now, but IO Interactive is on a roll and only time will tell if their next project is as good.",,,,"With the new trilogy coming to an end and Agent 47 yielding to 007, the developers have finally stuck the landing thanks to a few smart tweaks to design, mechanics, and tone.

With its delightfully witty dialogue and the fact that all existing Hitman content (as long as you’ve bought Hitman and Hitman 2) has progression carry over into Hitman 3, this game is a joy to play and the best Hitman has ever been. It takes all the best parts of the series we’ve come to love and leaves us with a bittersweet, Agent 47-sized gap in our hearts.",,,,,,,"After four years, the Hitman trilogy is coming to an end. And what an end it is. Not necessarily in terms of story, but in terms of gameplay, Io Interactive has put together a fantastic sandbox that invites to both brutal, clever, and purely comic murders.

You can spend as much time on an individual destination as you would any Triple-A action game. Dartmoor’s atmosphere and family conspiracy is a highlight; Mendoza’s another, with a fancy party held in a winery fronting some intense security and a guarded villa above. It’s interesting that both feel very much inspired by Hitman: Contracts’ Beldingford Manor and Blood Money’s A Vintage Year, but it’s a testament to the design that they manage to feel so distinct, highlighting just how impressive the near flawless execution of social stealth is here. [Issue#185, p.76]",,,,,,,"It doesn’t really bring anything new to the Hitman formula. Still, Hitman 3 offers the biggest and the most intricate levels in the trilogy, as well as the satisfying conclusion to the current story arc. [Issue#241, p.52]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
olliolli-world,,,,,,,"Highly addictive and visually stunning, OlliOlli World is the definition of entertainment.",We're not too sure about the new visual style and cheesy story but we've always loved this series and OlliOlli World has elevated and improved the gameplay a huge amount.,,,,,"OlliOlli World is an incredible reboot and the perfect evolution of the OlliOlli franchise. It's vivid and bright levels combined with the creativity in their design make for a deep gameplay meta that will keep you coming back for years. To put it simply, Roll7 did for OlliOlli in 2022 what Sony Santa Monica did for God Of War in 2018.",,,,,,,"It’s slick, speedy, plays well and addictive and embraces the weird, wonderful and diverse side of skateboarding culture. This is a game all about going on a road trip with your friends, finding crazy spots, pulling mad tricks and skating everything in sight.",OlliOlli World is an extremely fun experience that showcases Roll7's passion for skating. The game is spectacular and shows that this extreme sport still has room in the industry.,,,"OlliOlli World is an absurdly intricate game. Yet it is lovingly approachable. Roll7 has been working with this series for almost a decade and their efforts have bore exceptional fruit. In the path to achieve Gnarvana, players will encounter an exuberant world populated with a wild cast of characters. The series’ move to 3D has paid off. But more importantly, the complex mechanics of its tricks and combos have been polished to a luxurious sheen, rewarding players of all skill levels and degrees of dedication. I can think of few things I would change about OlliOlli World aside from more and more levels and hundreds more cosmetic options. As it stands, though, the game is bursting at the seams with finesse, eclipsing what was already a near-perfect harmony.","Although February has a whole host of excellent games that are all vying for your wallet, I can’t see any of them overtaking how heartfelt, charming, and satisfying to play OlliOlli World is. Sure, it might not have double-jumping horses or robot dinosaurs, but becoming a skate wizard should be your first priority this month.","OlliOlli World expands the series' formula with great success, effortlessly generating competition with a relentless sense of forward momentum.",,"Although some mechanics can take a while to master, and challenges may be frustrating at times, OlliOlli World is an overall fun experience with a lot to offer those familiar with, and new, to the series.",,,,"OlliOlli World is a fun, very accessible game that lets you easily pull of many tricks, fly over chasms and slide on dinosaur bones as you explore an enticing wacky world. What I don’t like about Roll7’s latest creation, was its narrative side, a sudden difficulty spike by the end and the lack of a good level editor.",,,"OlliOlli World finally sees the series’ visual style matching its frenetic, fun gameplay. Mostly every new feature added by Roll7 works in its favor, providing a satisfying and impressively deep skateboarding game with immense replayability, tons of customization options, and a fun multiplayer mode. OlliOlli has always been slept on as a series, but with World, this could — and hopefully will — all change.",,,,,"If you enjoyed Roll7’s previous OlliOlli games, it’s safe to say that you’ll love their evolution into OlliOlli World. Even if you weren’t a fan, there’s more than enough here to entice new players. The controls are accessible and easy to get to grips with, though there’s still plenty of depth for advanced players. Combine that with beautiful visuals, a kicking soundtrack and wonderfully animated characters, and what more could you possibly want? It’s never felt better to land a truly epic trick.",,,"OlliOlli World is a beautiful game, but the gameplay gets very frustrating after the first few worlds.","If you’re feeling understandably worn down by the monotony of the daily grind, OlliOlli World is the charming virtual alternative.","OlliOlli World is an amazing skateboarding experience through a Cartoon Network like world. Almost every aspect of this game is enjoyable, except of the dialogues and the not so interesting story.",,,,,,,,,"While I wish there was a ‘Story Mode’ toggle of some kind, OlliOlli World’s writing didn’t distract me too much from an otherwise fantastic skateboarding game. The levels are beautifully presented, well designed, and diverse, while Roll7’s approach to difficulty makes the game easy to learn but tough to master. There’s plenty to see and do in OlliOlli World, and with some tough challenges and neat social features, OlliOlli enthusiasts will be playing this one for a long time to come.","OlliOlli World is a delightfully charming little platformer. It has its own sense of style, and it's dripping with personality. The gameplay is a delightful mix that's easy to pick up and play but difficult to master. If you're looking for something that scratches the Tony Hawk bug, then OlliOlli World succeeds in spades. Just don't get frustrated when your near-perfect run is ruined by a stray cat sitting at the very end of the level.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Skating in 2.5D is a real pleasure with OlliOll World. The gameplay is almost perfect and thanks to the creative levels with plenty to do, the game has a high replayability. This is accompanied by a fine learning curve, an excellent soundtrack, many customization options and so on. That the story is not that interesting you have to accept, because the rest is excellent! Must have.",,"OlliOlli World is a huge leap forwards for Roll7's skating series. Lovely new presentation, a fun location filled with personality, and that all-important, ever-addictive gameplay align to make for a super fun take on the sport. While it's been made more approachable to new players, it still offers quite a stern challenge, and not all the dialogue and characters nail it. However, any nit picks easily melt away when it all clicks. Heaven really might be a halfpipe, after all.","OlliOlli World is a well-made game that tests your coordination. The story might feel simple, but it does have beautiful art and fun challenges that keep you coming back, even with its intense difficulty.",,,,"In short, it's more complete, more pleasant to watch, still as exhilarating and quick to play. A real achievement for the license.",Whether OlliOlli World charms you or chafes at your patience will depend on your appetite for such whimsy.,,,,,,,,,"Constantly expressive and chill enough to be mesmerising, World hits the line between welcoming and challenging with all the grace of the Hawk-man himself. [Issue#12, p.74]",,,,,,,,,,"OlliOlli World is an incredible skateboarding-based platformer with fantastic level and mission design and one of the tightest control systems in the genre. A must-have for those who like skateboarding, platformers and a challenge.","Roll7 has put out an impressive game, and if you're up to the challenge, you'll have a great way to spend your downtime.",,"OlliOlli World opens the door for new and old fans with casual and hardcore systems to master. Its controller layout takes some getting used to, and the frame rate issue doesn't make that easier, but there's so much here to keep you invested. It's a game that demands to be replayed, and luckily it's so damn fun that that isn't an issue, and the sheer amount of content will keep you skating for hours.",,"OlliOlli World is exactly what you want from an arcade game: it's quick, it punishes mistakes, but it embodies the spirit of trying again. Pair that with some Saturday morning cartoon visuals and characters, an overly-sweet level of charm, and the sense that Roll7 are having a fun time making this, and you've got a perfect recipe for frustrating fun.",,,,"Olliolli World is a promise kept. A game dedicated to skate that embraces every aspect of street culture in a perfect blend of Platform, Rythm Game and heart-pounding Arcade. The biggest news is in having finally discovered the third dimension, lighting that has led to a crazy level design in its intricate simplicity, the real keystone of a title that makes inclusion its watchword. One of the best titles on the market, perfect both for those who want to be obsessed with the execution of the perfect combo in each stage, and for those who need a ""different"" title to disconnect from the wear and tear (even videogame) of modern life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"OlliOlli World is simply brilliant. It's a hymn to gameplay, joy and the search for the perfect run. Mixing up old school platforming and a very keen skate simulation, Roll7 created a clever, fun and compelling adventure on wheels.","Without bringing any significant gameplay novelty, Roll7 still offers to its series a universe with a crazy charm. For those who have already played the first two episodes, you will certainly be on familiar ground: the levels follow one another at full speed, the difficulty is still high, and the secondary challenges should keep the hardcore gamers busy for many hours. A good game, efficient and fun, if not as original as its artistic direction would have let you hope.","I really enjoyed my time with OlliOlli World. It's a gorgeous and goofy game that onboards new players well while also giving veterans plenty of challenge. There's even a silly story tied in about searching for the mythical skate gods of ""Gnarvana"" in the world of ""Radlandia."" It's sufficiently dumb in an endearing way and entirely skippable if you're not interested – which I wasn't after an hour or so. Despite some headaches thrown in the mix, I welcomed all of OlliOlli World's challenges, even when they came at the detriment of my own hands.",,,,"OlliOlli World is one of the best platformers of recent years, a spectacular interpretation of the skate genre and, in general, a very fun, serene game, as relaxing as it is competitive, as spiritual as it is consistent and muscular.",,,,,,,,"A (lot) more content on the multiplayer side would have been welcome, but as it is, Olli Olli World is enjoyable and will please anyone enjoying Scoring, and Scoring higher, and higher. Also, fancy art to boot.",,,,,"There's so much to OlliOlli World that you can always leave a course to try something else for a while before coming back. That freedom to just leave a problem and tackle it again later, or to shut off the point-scoring part of your brain and get into the flow, is what makes OlliOlli World so endearing. Its controls feel great, its art style is gorgeous, and its characters are light and fun. It's a game that will push you to be the most ridiculously skilled skater you can be, or just let you spend some time in its world for a bit. Either way, it's easy for hours to evaporate as you rattle off tricks and snag sick grinds. That seems like a perfect conception of skateboarding to me.","And so what looks like a fun, cartoony jaunt on a skateboard, that can actually be played as such, early on, can also very quickly turn into a deep and unforgiving monster wrought with indomitable challenge and pedestal moments brought on by death-defying triumphs. It’s the sort of slowburn game communities build around, in league with titles like Super Meat Boy, the Trials series or Cuphead, to name a few. Games where challenge is key, but bragging rights are better.",,,,,"OlliOlli World is pretty much the ideal arcade game. Incredibly tight systems and gameplay, a feedback loop that keeps you wanting to top the leaderboard, and a soundtrack that makes every session a strong vibe. Accessibility and body customisation options are lacking, but are areas that should easily be updatable, and will hopefully add to an incredible basis.","OlliOlli World delivers beautiful, fast-paced, and captivating skateboarding fun.",,,,"Maybe the most important thing about OlliOlli World is that it’s playful. It encourages experimentation, whether it’s with how you approach an obstacle or how you want your character to look. That’s really the essence of skate culture: creativity on a board. OlliOlli World captures that — and then puts its own bizarre twist on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A gorgeous piece of skateboarding. The culmination of everything we've come to expect from OlliOlli with a heart-warmingly wholesome approach that reminds us anybody can board if you've got the urge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f1-2021,,"There isn’t a ton to dislike about F1 2021. The latest version adds to the series’ win streak with another strong iteration. With a few additional layers to the visual and audio presentation, we could have been looking at a form of racing perfection. As it is, F1 2021 is still really good.",,,,,,"It hasn't moved far visually from last year's effort but the package F1 2021 is offering is substantial. Braking Point provides a daft narrative diversion that might offer new players a gateway into the sport. For the rest of us, career mode remains largely the same with plenty of time to be spent chasing the front of the grid. The handling feels consistent and the racing is compelling, although the AI does seem to lack a little pace. The DualSense offers some welcome additional feedback, although I did find initially the adaptive triggers off-putting.",,"F1 2021 is one of the best F1 games to date, with a fun little story mode in the form of Braking Point, also presenting a great co-op driving career mode, and marking the return of the extremely detailed and fun My Team mode. The only drawbacks it has are its severely smaller amount of content than the 2020 edition, and occasional server problems.",,,"If you’ve grown tired of last year’s game then you can probably sit this iteration out; for first time players, or those returning after a couple of years' hiatus, Formula 1 games have never felt so authentic, so in-depth, yet so accessible. Slip on your race suit and climb into the cockpit.",,,,"‘F1 2021’ builds on the solid foundation of its predecessors and has retained their strengths. The sense of speed is phenomenal, and thanks to the many driving aids, both a beginner, a seasoned simulation racer and everyone in between will find plenty of challenge on the track. The game also takes advantage of the powerful hardware of the latest Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X, thereby also eliminating one of its biggest shortcomings: the miserably long loading times between races are a thing of the past.","F1 2021 continues the excellent playable feel boosted from its previous installment. The arrival of the new generation of consoles brings us a game that takes few risks, but does not make it worse for that: it is the best opportunity to enjoy F1.",,,,,,"F1 2021 continues to grow on what 2020 built. It’s a technical, story driver, fast, and fun ride. It’s a continuation into a franchise that has become what any F1 fan, or honestly racing fan in general has been wanting for years.","Whether you’re looking for fierce competition or you simply want to get as close to driving around F1’s real tracks as life allows without becoming a professional driver, F1 2021 has you covered. It’s the closest you’re ever going to feel to the real thing while sitting on your couch, and isn’t that really what playing any sports sim is all about?",,,"With one of the most comprehensive Career Modes available in a sports game and enough options to make it accessible to anyone, F1 2021 is enjoyable for newcomers and veterans alike.",,,,,,,,,,,,"F1 2021 is, without a doubt, Codemasters’ best F1 game to date. It’s just a shame that coronavirus hasn’t made its career mode quite as accurate as some might hope it to be, and some bits here and there seem to be lacking a bit of polish. Still, if you’re open to look past such issues, you’ll find a deep, rewarding racing experience that’s highly customisable. And if you delve into Braking Point, you’ll also find a story mode that genuinely adds to the package. Whether you’re an ardent F1 fan or not, F1 2021 is likely to be a contender for the accolade of best racing game of the year, that’s for sure.",,,"F1 2021 is the complete package. Braking Point is an excellent single-player experience, driving is perfection, and there's so much to do. It really does have everything, regardless of whether you are a fan of the sport or not.",,,"F1 2021 is a great racing game, specially once you move into the car and feel the excellent handling and the great performance. Modes (specially Braking Point and classic content) could have been better, but you will feel like Hamilton and Verstappen racing each other for the victory.",,"F1 2021 arrives with the clear premise of being continuist and at the same time introducing improvements among what has worked well during these past deliveries. The inclusion of its story mode under the name of Braking Point gives a real breath of fresh air to a trite season mode that, while entertaining, needed this twist.",,,,,,,,,,,,"F1 2021 surpasses its predecessor again and, along with the career co-op mode, makes a fantastic racing game likewise for beginners and experts.",,,,,,,"A new year, a new F1 game. This one boosts an elaborate story mode, that's somehow both clichéd and very much worth experiencing. On top of that, F1 2021 also has a number of significant improvements over its predecessor. There's still some clumsy animations, though, so take that into account.",,"With a bunch of smart additions, F1 2021 is a cracking simulator for both die-hard fans and newcomers. The Braking Point story mode doesn't have a particularly compelling narrative, but it's a brilliant gateway into the motorsport and a primer for the wider game. Two Player Career, the Expert driving style, Real Season Start, and more make this the most customisable and accessible iteration yet, allowing you to play how you like across the game's excellent career options. Of course, the driving itself seals the deal, and it's a winner on that front. This is a no-brainer for F1 fans, but it's also a fantastic entry for newbie drivers to start with.",,,"Whether you're a Drive to Survive-looking casual fan or a hardcore racing fanatic who knows the precise sector times at Spa-Francorchamps from the past ten years by heart, F1 2021 is literally for everyone's Maximum enjoyment.",,"For its first lap on the next-gen, the Codemasters F1 series manages to offer content at the level.",,,"F1 2021 is the most fun you can have in a Formula driver’s cockpit. Braking Point brings the kind of drama you didn’t realize you needed in your racing life, even if it does get a little cringeworthy on occasion. This wonderful looking and sounding Formula racer shines on the PS5, even if some of the platform’s features are under-utilized at this time. With some sense of normalcy slowly returning to the sporting world at large, F1 2021 represents a great way to follow along with the F1 season while attempting to make a virtual name for yourself, and nowhere else does the sport come alive more than in F1 2021.",,,"Despite some flaws, Codemasters delivers the total package with F1 2021. A huge amount of options and licensed content are only topped by the superb handling and the great graphics – especially on PS5. F1 2021 sets its own bar a bit higher than before, without being a revolutionary on its own right.",,,,"Another stellar sim that isn’t quite as assured on PS5 as you might hope. But story mode is worth playing and career mode is the best in the business. [Issue#4, p.82]",,,An entertaining and surprisingly effective new story mode heads up an otherwise modest refresh for Codemasters' official series. [Eurogamer Recommended],,,,,"There either isn’t enough focus on the story to engage you or the racing focus is held back by the unattainable challenges and grind that comes with progressing. My Team is largely the same and if you paid more for the legendary drivers, you’ll be selecting one of those seven as a teammate at a time and won’t be using them in any other mode. The removal of Classic Mode and the ability to race as a current F1 driver in any mode outside of Grand Prix is disheartening and the fact that this information wasn’t made readily available to potential buyers isn’t good. Hopefully the issues with the AI can be patched as the actual racing and car physics are still excellent. There was a lot of opportunity for F1 2021, and on top of three circuits on this year’s calendar not being readily available for launch, there’s a lot left on the table for the current generation premiere of the series.",,,,"F1 2021 is one of the broadest depictions of the sport ever created, building on familiar cars and handling alongside returning multiplayer, esports, and My Team career modes, while the new Braking Point story gives you a taste of the teammate drama you loved to watch (and mock) in Netflix's Drive to Survive.",,,,,,,"F1 2021 is a solid, full-bodied chapter full of content. It probably represents one of the best hybridizations between simulation and accessibility on the market today.",,,,,,"The Braking Point mode needs some work and the absence of F1 Legends let us down, but with superb visuals and great driving mechanics, F1 2021 is one of the best entries in the series so far.",,,,,"F1 2021 is the best-looking and most customisable instalment of the long-running Codemasters series to date, and the ability to tinker under the hood of the core career experience and play co-op with a friend is very welcome. With the addition of Braking Point it’s also arguably the boldest F1 game so far. The characterisation is a little underdone and the E for Everyone approach means it’s quite an airbrushed take on the F1 world compared to Netflix’s tense and profanity-laden Drive to Survive, but injecting a story mode into the F1 series was a risk well worth taking and I’m certainly looking forward to more of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"F1 2021 incorporates (and improves) all the features of the previous F1 games developed by Codemasters. Driving is fun and can be adapted to suit both newbies and those looking for a sufficiently complex experience, although players who look for a full simulation might be slightly disappointed. Game modes are numerous, varied and well structured. Both those who love to run alone and those who prefer to compete with (or against) other players will find something that will keep them busy for months.",,,,,"When Codemaster's acclaimed F1 series makes its debut on the new consoles, it is not the enhanced graphics that make the biggest impact, but a brand-new story mode. An exciting addition, which unfortunately does not reach its full potential. Fortunately, the superb career mode is intact and slightly improved, as are the many options available to those who prefer to play online. Although some content has been removed since last year's version, and a few other issues remain, F1 2021 offers almost everything an F1 fan could wish for.",,,,,,,F1 2021's new story mode and level of customisation and accessibility make it perfect for hardened racing fans and those looking to take the genre for a spin.,,,"This is about as realistic as you can get for a console racing game, but don't let that intimidate you.

It is “one hell of a game.”",,,,,,,,,,"There's something so magical about the way Overcooked mixes simple cooking instructions with frantic stage hazards that require verbal check-ins between co-op players.

Outside of it, things are a little less straightforward. While there is some excellent world-building and combat here, Hogwarts Legacy is let down by a questionable narrative and some unnecessary open world baggage.","Hogwarts Legacy takes you on a magical journey full of classes, adventure and unlocking the mystery behind your protagonist's unique abilities in addition to mix and matching your learned spells to vanquish your enemy in style.","A gigantic love letter to one of the most beloved and relevant universes of youth literature, and one of the best games of the year.","Warner Bros. announced this game with much fanfare a long time ago, but Hogwarts Legacy lives up to all expectations.

It is one of those entries that puts everything else in a difficult position, first because it is miles ahead of everything that has been done before and second because the video games after will have quite a tough time to match its quality. Hogwarts Legacy is the video game that Harry Potter fans deserve, and one for which I was not ready at all.","Avalanche Software made us wait a long time for the effects of their efforts, but today I can only take my hat off to the team behind the game and admit it was worth it. Hogwarts Legacy is not just an amazing gift for Harry Potter fans, but above all an excellent action RPG that provides many hours of fun. It brilliantly fulfills a child’s dream of a journey to the world of magic, for which the credit goes primarily to the gameplay and world designers, because what the writers delivered is sadly no better than fan fiction.",,Hogwarts Legacy is a sometimes unremarkable open world game that's severely uplifted by its dedication to the best parts of the source material.,"Hogwarts Legacy is full of Harry Potter fanservice, but as a game, it’s only serviceable. A fun but forgettable journey that isn’t worth the amount of controversy surrounding it.",,"Thanks to its sprawling world and plethora of engaging ways to play, Hogwarts Legacy manages to set itself apart as the best Harry Potter related game of all time.",,,"Avalanche Software and Portkey Games have done an impressive job of creating something original within a much-loved franchise. Hogwarts Legacy is the closest any of us are ever going to get to actually attending Hogwarts, and what a magical experience it is. It’s clear that it’s been created with love, and the attention to detail here is phenomenal. It’s not without its issues, of course, but there’s few that get in the way of the overall experience. It looks gorgeous, it’s a joy to play, and being a wizard is just about as fun as we’d always hoped it would be.","The bottom line is that Hogwarts Legacy is fun. Exploring the school, Hogsmeade and the surrounding hamlets is rewarding. The spells feel like they’ve come alive from the pages of the books. Combat is exciting and very challenging on the higher settings. But it’s not without some faults. Glitches are encountered frequently, and some parts of the game can be frustrating. On PS5, Hogwarts Legacy looks and runs great. If you’re really into the world of Harry Potter, or open world games in general, you are going to love Hogwarts Legacy.","Vaguely stale combat and an open world with little to offer beyond the castle grounds aside, it’s hard to consider Hogwarts Legacy as anything other than a success for the Harry Potter fans who have waited this long for their letter. This is a strong adventure with more than enough magic to ensure players will be attending classes long after the credits roll.","Hogwarts Legacy is filled with so many mechanics that nothing feels arbitrary, with so much joy to be found within its story and spell books.","Hogwarts Legacy starts to feel like countless open-world games of the past decade once you’ve been playing it for more than 15 hours. However, you get to ride a Hippogriff. It’s those magical moments and the setting that rescue it from mediocrity, but only if the Wizarding World still has you under its spell.",,"Hogwarts Legacy has the same structure you've seen in any other modern open world game, but, at the same time, it fills you with memories from long time ago... When a Flipendo was all you needed to push a block. It may no do anything different or relevant than those games, but it has something they lack: magic.","Hogwarts Legacy is one of the all-time great surprises in my 25+ years of gaming. I love everything about it. The world is stunning. The combat is both satisfying and challenging. And it’s reignited my love for something seemingly lost to space and time. Overnight, Avalanche Software has cemented itself as a triple-A developer, delivering a game that belongs in conversations with the very best. Class is in session, folks.",,"Pushing the J.K. Rowling controversy to the side, Hogwarts Legacy is a true celebration of the magical universe that she created which perfectly transitioned to film. Her universe has equally been adapted well into this game courtesy of Avalanche Studios with its gameplay and story. Whether the story will become canon is yet to be seen but again this is as close as you can get to the core of what the extended universe of Harry Potter can be that not only plays well on the PS5 but looks fantastic.","Hogwarts Legacy tells a great story of the wizarding world, with a beautiful audiovisual work and solid mechanics to the lore of this universe. Its greatest quality, however, lies in making all of this contribute to the fantastic experience of immersion and belonging that every fan has always dreamed of.",,,"Hogwarts Legacy's wonderful world makes it one of those games that you'd just love to keep experiencing for the first time - forever - and we envy anyone who's yet to step into it. Even if it's just a regular, open-world game underneath all the magic, it truly is an excellent one.",,"As we near the end of this review, I have a small secret. I'm not someone you'd call a ""fan"" of the Wizarding World, at least not in the sense where I've got my own wand or want to down a butterbeer. I enjoy and appreciate the world that was built and the characters in it, but it's not like I got fully sucked in. That changed a little after a few dozen hours of playing Hogwarts Legacy. If you're a fan, you're in heaven, and if you're not ... well, this game might not make you love magic, but you'll certainly want to like it.","Hogwarts Legacy offers *the* promised Wizarding World-simulation in an open game world, with a deluge of content that Harry Potter-fans can sink their teeth into.",,"Hogwarts Legacy is the Wizarding World game that fans have dreamt of for years. It offers a dense and rich open-world to explore complemented perfectly by a surprisingly robust and engaging combat system unlike anything else. While the story does live in the shadow of its predecessors, and managing gear can be repetitive, Hogwarts Legacy is a truly magical experience and utterly bewitching from beginning to end.","Hogwarts Legacy is the game we were promised with smooth gameplay and gorgeous graphics of a world of magic. While there are moments of choppy fighting mechanics, this game opens up the possibility of sequels and DLCs exploring more of this magical environment.",Hogwarts Legacy is a magical role-playing game for Potter fans that enchants us despite minor quirks and its formulaic open world.,,"If you grew up a Harry Potter fan and still keep Hogwarts in your heart, this is probably a dream come true. Hogwarts Legacy is exactly what you'd expect from an open-world RPG within that universe. Immersive, beautifully done, with plenty of spells, challenges, beasts, quests, combat and also nice storytelling. It's such a fun ride that you could go for 100+ hours and not even feel it. It's like taking a sip of Felix Felicis.",,"Despite a few downsides like the annoying loading times when you open a door or lack of enemy variety, Hogwarts Legacy is truly a great game that cast its spell on me from the very first few minutes.",,,"Avalanche Studios has managed to develop the ultimate Potter game, without bringing in the famous wizard. Now that you can experience for yourself what it's like to be in a wizarding school and experience adventures similar to those of the famous wizard is a dream for any fan of the Harry Potter franchise. This dream is provided with a wonderfully beautiful world, which is also full of varied things that you can do and experience. The different spells you get to learn make for great fights and the wide variety of enemies keeps the fighting fresh. Hogwarts Legacy is just one big party for Harry Potter fans. The only thing that is negative is that it sometimes has to load during gameplay and that two graphic modes cause ghosting. However, this will not spoil the fun.",,"Hogwarts Legacy has turned the hopes and dreams of Harry Potter fans into reality. Finally there is a proper simulator of the school of witchcraft and wizardry, allowing you to create your own student, attend classes, and explore the vast landscape outside. It's not without its issues — side quests prove far too basic, the menus are poor, and annoying timers hurt the player experience — but they don’t get in the way of something that so blatantly comes from a place of extensive love for the source text. Almost 26 years after Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone hit bookshelves, video game fans finally have a magical title to be proud of. It's everything we’ve dreamt of.","Hogwarts Legacy fully lives up to its promise to take you on the role of a new student at Hogwarts and introduce you to the famous Wizarding World immortalized in the Harry Potter movies. However, the experience continues beyond there. The narrative values of the story are high. The progression does have significant development. The characters always have something to tell you about the adventure. Avalanche Software developed an experience that fans will love and those outside of the Magical World will want to know.","Hogwarts Legacy offers a beautiful Hogwarts Castle and a fun wizarding system which together lay down solid foundations for the future. The present, however, is dragged back by a silly story, bad optimization, and filler content.","Hogwarts Legacy is without a doubt the best Wizarding World game ever, but one that borrows a lot from other RPGs and contains a lot of technical flaws. For Potterheads, that won't spoil the fun, and a surprisingly action-packed game awaits that confirms that you don't need Harry Potter for a nice piece of magic.","A truly wizard RPG, whose historical setting frees it from the limitations of the books and films, with an open world experience that entertains no matter how much you care about the source material.","What an adventure ! Hogwarts Legacy is definitely the game all Harry Potter fans have been waiting for. Beautiful, lively, exhilarating and surprising, it drips with passion and magic and is a real pleasure to browse. But that's not all ! With its very good ideas, its world just waiting to be explored, its art direction to die for and its combat system as addictive as it is magical, it is quite simply an excellent action and adventure game. We would have liked choices with more impact or a proposal a little off the beaten track. As you will have understood, there are many things to say about Hogwarts Legacy. But to leave you the surprise, we let you discover the magic of this game which will very clearly mark the year 2023. And, who knows, it may be a potential good candidate for the GOTY...",,,"Hogwarts Legacy is the game Harry Potter fans have dreamt of since the first book was released. It puts you firmly in the shoes of a student and turns you loose to find your place in the world of wizardry. Unfortunately, its biggest issue is that it often feels like you’re just visiting.","Hogwarts Legacy isn’t the perfect game, with the main story falling short in areas and technical issues providing some frustrating moments. However, it achieves a level of immersion that grips you into the wizarding world and doesn’t let you go. Whether it’s attending classes, getting lost in the mysterious hallways of Hogwarts, or visiting Ollivander’s to pick out the perfect wand, Avalanche has crafted a magical experience that takes you back to the day you first encountered Harry Potter, recapturing all the feelings that came with it.",,,"Hogwarts Legacy may not have enough magic to ensnare all gamers, but fans of the series will find more than enough enjoyment in Avalanche Software's open-world adventure.","It's hard not to be fascinated by the magical world of Hogwarts Legacy, so much the game has been made with passion. The first steps in this adventure are enchanting, especially when it comes to Hogwarts Castle, Hogsmeade and all the interiors in reality. It's beautiful, it's alive, it's teeming with details and contemplation is indeed there. Of course, not everything is perfect, but the game invites so much exploration with its ultra generous open world that we manage to close our eyes to certain flaws.",,,,,,,"In one delightful moment, my historical knowledge was used to mislead me, as the game both conformed to and subverted my expectations of what I expected a character to do based on her actions in actual history. Games often reward players for knowing their lore, and it was exhilarating to be punished for it. I’m not saying that you need to have a dozen Japanese history tabs open like I currently do. But playing the game while knowing the history gives you a unique experience.",,Hogwarts Legacy is a game that relies entirely on your nostalgia to power your enjoyment — it’s a piñata with nothing inside.,"Hogwarts Legacy isn’t perfect, but it’s successful in capturing the magic of the franchise and setting a solid foundation for any future games set in the Wizarding World. Hogwarts Legacy thankfully follows in the footsteps of Harry Potter, not Fantastic Beasts.","The chips might have been stacked against them, but Warner Bros. and Avalanche Software have delivered on their promise. Hogwarts Legacy is the game that fans have been waiting for, laying down a solid foundation to build off of moving forward.","But what separates Hogwarts Legacy from others of its kind is being Hogwarts Legacy: the stunning recreation of the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and the world around it. Walk through the lines we read. Entering the rooms that we could not see in the cinema seat. Hogwarts Legacy has its flaws, but when dreams come true they always do.","The best Hogwarts experience ever made is finally here. Though it's not without its flaws, Hogwarts Legacy is a phenomenal game that has a lot of great ""somethings for everyone."" This is by far the best Wizarding World video game to ever come out and stands with a select few games that prove more is more.","The sights and sounds alone make Hogwarts Legacy the dream Harry Potter game fans have been longing for. There’s an intriguing mystery to unravel, though you’re bound to spend most of your time exploring a wealth of side content, visiting virtual landmarks and roleplaying as a Hogwarts student. That said, it’s more successful in being a sandbox teeming with nostalgia rather than a stand-out action RPG in its own right, let down by gameplay foibles and spellcasting combat that quickly slides into repetition.","Hogwarts Legacy is a genuine wizarding adventure from beginning to end. There’s no mistaking that the writing and world-building lend so much to the experience that it overshadows the repetitive battle system and unintuitive menu designs. There’s a true sense of discovery provided that stems from the freedom given to players to take on this game the way they want. The jury is still out on the target audience, but I had a magical time.","Hogwarts Legacy is probably the best Harry Potter game out there. Hogwarts and the wizarding world are very faithful to the original, and each quest is designed to make the content rich, but not deep enough.","The hugely anticipated Hogwarts Legacy does not disappoint. An early GOTY contender offers interesting storytelling parallels with the Harry Potter franchise, beautiful and glorious fan favourite locations, and an array of exciting combat and collectibles for hours of entertainment.","Though not without design and story issues of its own, Hogwarts Legacy ultimately comes across as a densely packed and well-made RPG that players will find incredibly easy to enjoy.",,"Hogwarts Legacy is the best Harry Potter inspired video game ever made. Avalanche Software managed to capture the magic of the Wizarding World and built a relaxing and satisfying safe haven for every potterhead. It’s not all roses, many flaws from the open world formula are still present and it remains a cross-gen video game, but it manages to keep its core promise: to give life to Hogwarts itself. And this, in our book, it’s already a big win.","Hogwarts Legacy can be a manifesto of the heart that wins over reason. The one concocted by Avalanche Software is in fact an open world RPG that is not very stimulating in the dynamics of exploration and with a not entirely impactful role-playing formula, which could tire the most demanding players. However we believe that the flaws are well balanced by a good combat system, a great attention to detail and an impeccable art direction, which represents a true love letter to the Wizarding World and its fans.","Hogwarts Legacy is an experience of mammoth proportions, really difficult to summarize in a few words. A meticulous reproduction of Hogwarts, its intricate labyrinths, its infinite secrets, is accompanied by a rich and multifaceted game structure, which will make you feel like real Hogwarts students for the first time. The game is to all intents and purposes what a Harry Potter fan has always dreamed of. Even those who have never followed the adventures of the wizard, however, will find an engaging adventure, with a game world that is nothing short of fascinating. We really hope this is the start of a bigger project, because it would be a shame to limit such a successful formula to a single game.",,,"Avalanche Software has meticulously re-created Hogwarts down to such minute details that it's sure to bring out the child in most of us — it is, doubtlessly, a gorgeous realization of the Wizarding World. Attending classes, taming beasts, exploring Hogwarts, and learning new spells could keep you occupied for hours, but it's nowhere near a groundbreaking experience. If you strip the Harry Potter IP away from Hogwarts Legacy, you're just left with another standard RPG that we've seen countless times before.",,,,"Masterpiece, Meisterstück, chef d’œuvre, Magnum opus. It is a word with a broad meaning, whose origins are not well defined. It may be an apprentice's first noteworthy work - 'first work'. It can be a work of art of exceptional value. In the case of Hogwarts Legacy, it's both. The best compliment you can give Hogwarts Legacy is: I want more. I want more of this world, and I want to see other universes I enjoy (like Star Wars and Dune) get this kind of treatment. Rarely does an RPG manage to remain not fresh, expansive and frankly surprising from start to finish, but Avalanche Software did it. Hats off – but not the Sorting Hat, as I'm already starting a new save.",,,"In nearly every way, Hogwarts Legacy is the Harry Potter RPG I’ve always wanted to play. Its open-world adventure captures all the excitement and wonder of the Wizarding World with its memorable new characters, challenging and nuanced combat, and a wonderfully executed Hogwarts student fantasy that kept me glued to my controller for dozens of hours. It’s certainly weighed down by technical issues, a lackluster main story, and some poor enemy variety, but even those couldn’t come close to breaking its enchanting spell over me.","So prepare your wands, put on your wizard robe and start exploring this incredibly magical world of Hogwarts which is an amazing homage to Harry Potter universe which set the bar so high, that not even Levioso could put other games on the same level.","The magical adventure around Hogwarts and the Scottish highlands excites almost all along the line. Gameplay and story contradict each other in some moments. The performance problems at the start are forgivable, but spoil the fun in rare occasions. A must for fans.",,,,"Hogwarts Legacy fulfilled a long-standing childhood dream of mine: the dream of receiving my Hogwarts acceptance letter as a kid, and waving a wand around to do all sorts of cool magic tricks. Bad fanfic or not, it’s hard to ignore the amount of pure, unbridled joy I got out of the game simply by being present in its immersive world. Hogwarts Legacy gave me the rare opportunity to be transported back to a time that was harder in some ways, but also simpler in many others. The fantasy of what could’ve been was sweet and lovely, but also devastatingly fleeting. Then again, perhaps that’s really all I could ever ask for.",,,,"Atmospheric, in love with detail - but in the end too concerned about safety: Hogwarts Legacy is a really good wizarding adventure, which leaves room for improvement, especially in the story.","Hogwarts Legacy has succeeded in presenting players a huge, mysteriously beautiful 'Hogwarts'. While the game expands the franchise's thrilling, magical experience throughout the Highlands, it did not forget the delicate touches for the original fans. It is safe to say that this is the game where the Wizarding World you've dreamed unfolds right before your eyes.","Hogwarts Legacy is an extremely beautiful game that features a not-so-open world, full of life and places to explore. The fighting system is very original. The fighting system is very original and it is extremely deep, it allows you to perform some great combos, defend yourself in multiple ways and it is also quite fluid. It has a beautiful soundtrack and very good performances. Sometimes I feel that the game guides us too much and that it lacks a bit of challenge in its activities. Hogwarts Legacy is definitely the game we were promised and expected.","Hogwarts Legacy provides an expansive world of magic and mystery. With a main story that is both whimsical and gritty, and over a hundred side quests, there are countless reasons to ply out an enchanting life in the game. Occasional graphical issues are noticeable but overall negligible to the abundant sense of wonder. Hogwarts Legacy is a spellbinding and enchanting experience not to be missed.","Hogwarts Legacy has a fun and exciting combat system, and its visuals are simply beautiful. The school and other locations are full of life and details. Without a doubt, it's an amazing, huge and magical game; a charming journey that transports us to the world of Harry Potter.","A beautiful transposition of the Wizarding World, Hogwarts Legacy is both a tribute to the Harry Potter universe and a litmus test largely passed by Avalanche Studios with their first, big and delicate project.","Hogwarts Legacy is so extensive and ambitious that sacrifices have been made. It's not perfect in its finishing touches, but that's not a penalty: it's indeed the game that all potterheads dreamed of, but it's also a too classic RPG for those who are not familiar with the Harry Potter universe. If the gameplay is not always interesting, the scenario hides some remarkable surprises and the work done on the conception of Hogwarts and Hogsmeade is quite impressive. Visiting these two emblematic places of the saga will amaze you and will take you a long time, to add to an already colossal life span.","I encountered several minor technical issues over the course of my lengthy playthrough, such as pop-in while moving fast or long door-opening loads. And some of the game systems are more successful than others; a flood of useless low-quality gear rewards is one notable, if minor problem that sometimes stalls the fun. But for those who have long wished for a rich interactive playground to live out your own Harry Potter fantasy, Hogwarts Legacy casts an incredibly mesmerizing spell.","The best game ever to come out of the Wizarding World. Especially if you're still a fan of the series...It's an experience worth playing, even if it stumbles at times in the long run.",,,,,,"Avalanche Software has managed to turn a once far-fetched dream into a reality for many Harry Potter fans, as Hogwarts Legacy is simply a masterful fantasy experience. Despite a few hiccups here and there, this is still, hands down, the most authentic and immersive Wizarding World video game out there. My time with Hogwarts Legacy has been nothing short of remarkable, and I can’t wait to see what comes next in the franchise from Warner Bros.",,"Hogwarts Legacy is a fine action-adventure game with slight RPG-touches. I say ""slight"" because most of the game mechanics are nowhere near as deep as they have the potential to be. But the spellcasting, atmosphere and hours upon hours of quests, missions and things to do makes up for it.",,,"Classic and heavily focused on collecting stuff, this Harry Potter game by Avalanche game still offers solid arguments to immerse fans in a gripping and magnificent story of the Wizarding World.",,,,"Hogwarts Legacy is the most definitively accurate and exciting wizarding world adventure people could hope to experience, short of getting a real-life invitation to Hogwarts. With hours of content and a wealth of wizarding wonderment, you’d be hard pressed not to enjoy yourself to an impressive capacity.","Time is something Hogwarts Legacy and its repetitive quests, dull open world, and monotonous combat often do not respect, from its slow opening to its insistence on introducing new systems to juggle just for the sake of it. It's a bit of a shame that these parts couldn't coalesce in the same way that its presentation and respect for its universe does, because Hogwarts Castle persists as a delightful puzzle box to explore from the moment you step foot in its doors to the last day of term. There's equally delightful moments during some of the main quests, specifically those that balance puzzle-solving and combat in ways that challenge your understanding of the spells you have in engaging ways. But these moments are so spread out between much less interesting filler content that it will likely take some of the most dedicated Harry Potter fans to justify seeing the entire journey through.",,"While it doesn't do everything perfectly, Hogwarts Legacy stimulates the imagination with a rich world to explore and gameplay that empowers and thrills the player. The Harry Potter films had the tough task of taking words on a page and creating a visual language for them. Hogwarts Legacy had the even tougher task of taking that visual language and making it interactive, ultimately expanding it all into something that is fun to play and immerse yourself in. Although there's still a long year ahead of us and tons of great looking games on the horizon, Hogwarts Legacy is already one of the best games of 2023.",,,,,"Hogwarts Legacy delivers a perfectly competent adventure, but its most unforgivable curse is its lack of imagination. Despite having access to an entire universe of possibilities, its sole trick is using magic to cover up tired video game clichés that feel entirely disconnected from the vibrant source material it’s adapting. The only unique aspect it brings to the open-world genre is franchise branding, making for a shallow experience that doesn’t offer much more than wish fulfillment for fans unable to let go of a dream.",,"Hogwarts Legacy evokes the same magic as the first book's opening chapter, letting you explore a beautifully realized world, meet a fascinating cast of characters and embark on your own wizarding career. It's the Harry Potter game fans have been dreaming of for decades.","Hogwarts Legacy sometimes accomplishes its goal: To embed the player, more than any other game ever has, in Rowling’s universe of magic and mandatory whimsy. Clever touches abound—like a moment in the opening cutscene when a dragon devours a man right in front of your character, causing the death-sensitive thestrals pulling your carriage to suddenly pop into visibility—as does a rock-solid dedication to the series’ tone. This is, bar none, the most faithful Harry Potter game ever made. Stripped of the context in which the series now grimily floats, and even accepting the many flaws enumerated above, it’s what fans have spent years hoping for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There have been movie tie-ins and LEGO games but until Hogwarts Legacy, out Friday, no studio had attempted to make a big-budget, prestige experience based on the franchise. It was well worth the wait — developer Avalanche Software exceeded expectations.",,"Hogwarts Legacy is a very good game with a few weaker features that do not match the rest. However, the game is made with great care and, as a result, guarantees a fantastic adventure in the well-known world of magic. I would even let someone cast Obliviate on me, just to forget this game and be able to experience it again.",,,,,,,Hogwarts Legacy is the wizarding adventure in the Harry Potter universe that fans have been waiting for for so long. A title that even those unfamiliar with the series will be able to enjoy if they let themselves be carried away by magic.,"Whether you’re a diehard Potterhead or casual Wizarding World lover, you’ll have an epic time no matter what level of fan you are. Even though there is optional padding, it’s optional nonetheless. The core experience of Hogwarts Legacy is still not only the best game in the entire franchise but a seriously fun RPG that will take your breath away in its pinnacle moments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
resident-evil-village,The game branches the series out in new directions without trying to fix what wasn’t broken about its predecessor.,,,"It's a loud, mindless end to a game that features many stunningly crafted elements but rarely puts them to memorable use - a letdown after RE7 rescued the series from the convolutions of Resident Evil 6. [Issue#359, p.102]","Resident Evil Village proves that the developers at Capcom knows exactly what series fans want, and they’re happy to offer it, along with a lot more than anyone was expecting. Resident Evil 7 was a revolution for the series by framing the action in personal, intimate terms that intensified the scares and violence via the first-person perspective. Resident Evil Village proves that the same approach works just as well when removed from the small-scale, southern gothic setting and the action ramps up. Village really is the best of both worlds, and an amazing accomplishment for the series.","Resident Evil Village is truly the spiritual son of Resident Evil 4 and 7! This theme park of horror perfectly mixes horror and action and offers an extremely neat universe: the atmosphere is heavy, the bestiary generous, the casting is perfect and the puzzles bring a real cachet to one of the scariest Survival Horror I’ve been able to play in a long time. Unfortunately, the link with the series is not more exploited. Nevertheless, despite a less-inspired last part, what we have here the best Resident Evil since Resident Evil 4.","Resident Evil Village is another step forward in the new direction that Capcom taking this series towards, and they did a great job by focusing on a slightly new approach compared to the previous version, emphasizing on some other praised features we knew and loved about the older entries in the series. Mix all this with fresh and beautiful visuals that looks like pre-rendered trailers from the older games and you have an almost flawless brand new RE game.","Resident Evil Village is another fantastic game in the franchise. It leans towards action, rather than slow paced horror this time but also adds a large helping of exploration for those that want to see everything. Ethan isn't great but his opponents are very colourful and keep you interested in moving forward. Add the replayability of harder difficulties, New Game+ and Mercenaries mode and it's a game PS5 owners should not ignore.","Resident Evil Village is a love letter to old and new fans of the series, while including the style of puzzles of the old games with the newer action aspects of the series. Right now this is my favorite game in the series and Capcom might need to reinvent themselves in order to stay relevant even when they reach their 30th anniversary.","RE: Village is a mixture of almost all previous Resident Evil elements, making the most of both survival horror and puzzle intensity, but with the primary stage being left for the more action-like nature of Resident Evil 4. It has some great story moments, sprinkled with a few lacklustre characters that are still overshadowed by its most notable characteristic – most detailed environment to date.",,,"Resident Evil Village combines the best of the past 25 years of the franchise, bringing a compelling adventure that should appeal to action and horror fans alike. With massive locations offering a wealth of exploration and hidden goodies, a meaty campaign with some decent unlockables, Village is the franchise at the top of its game.",,A push and pull journey between two genres with an overlapping decent story and cast.,"Resident Evil Village tastes new while still exuding the aromas of its essence. It manages to explore terror through new settings while compiling different approaches to build a videogame that, while tending towards action, does not forget the puzzle, exploration and tension typical of the saga. All this with a top technical aspect and an interesting plot that manages to be significant in the macro-plot of its fiction.","Resident Evil: Village suffers from the same defect as many horror films: after a while we dare to open our eyes, the chips and coke are finished and we wait somewhat bored for the end of the film. So too in Village. As soon as the novelty wears off, the game deteriorates into a kind of slaughterfest that even reminded us a bit of Call of Duty. The tone of the game also changes. Moments of campy horror/humor are interspersed with scenes that are as much seriousness as blood. It seems a bit as if the creators didn't know which way they wanted to go and just took all sides at once. That's a shame for a game in a series that is already a quarter of a century old. These moments are not bad, but the contrast with Village's best bits is huge. Because when everything clicks together, it just crackles.","A superb game with excellent touches, great art and a confident execution. But its attempts to reintroduce classic design ideas from the saga are a bit lacking compared to the original ones.","Resident Evil Village is a game of unquestionably high quality, but sometimes its parts do not fit together. It’s hard to tell whether the developers were aiming for a terrifying horror game or an action-packed shooting experience: There are elements of both, along with the story, the new game plus systems and the inclusion of The Mercenaries, and sometimes these various elements do not work in harmony with each other. Village is a great game that you can enjoy with confidence, but with a little more synergy it could have been even better.",,"Needless to say, if you are a fan of the series, especially what was done with Resident Evil VII a few years ago, you will be very happy with what Resident Evil Village presents to us. What I would tell you is that it may be better if you lower your expectations a bit in relation to the size of the game and the developer's own ambitions. The eighth installment of this beloved saga is one that complies in a very good way with almost everything it tries, bearing in a very dignified way the name it represents, however, it is also true that we would have loved to take more important risks and let events go more calmly to present a longer adventure. Anyway, Capcom once again proves its worth and that it continues to be at the forefront if we talk about AAA development.","Resident Evil Village is not a game for everyone, and I feel Resident Evil 7 fans will enjoy it much more than the average player — but having fan favorite Chris Redfield back into the story was a welcome addition (including the retcon of his appearance in RE7).","Resident Evil Village doesn't have the most engrossing or satisfying story in Resident Evil history, and its more action-oriented approach is likely to disappoint fans that enjoyed RE7's pure horror. However, Resident Evil Village is packed with replay value, rarely has a dull moment, and should leave Resident Evil fans excited for the franchise's future.",Resident Evil Village is a gripping entry for this long-running horror franchise. Capcom has excelled at translating the strengths of this series through perspective and tonal shifts. It succeeds as both a horror game and an action game.,"Its attachment to the past can hold it back from greatness, especially in regards to its dedication to bombastic set-pieces and a hesitation to explore its own ideas. Village is drenched in excellence throughout, but the occasional fumble stops it from reaching the heights of both its predecessor and the seminal masterpiece it is so desperate to imitate. There’s also not nearly enough big lady - she needs her own game.",A strong start and okay finish makes this average out as decent but not amazing installment.,"A few years ago, if you had have told me that there would be a gothic horror Resident Evil, I would have laughed. What RE has traditionally done and the gothic tradition are so far apart they're almost antithetical. And yet, that is what Village has delivered. While this might be a direct sequel to the previous Resident Evil, that dramatic shift in atmosphere and theme makes this game, ironically enough, a Resident Evil for people who have previously not been Resident Evil fans. Don't worry, existing fans, there's still plenty there for you too, but Capcom's willingness to redefine its marquee horror franchise so substantially deserves real credit. The future of this venerable series seems bright when these are the moves that the developers are making.","Resident Evil Village is a gorgeous innovation that preserves the heart of a beloved franchise, and continues a string of excellent mainline entries that will dazzle veterans and newcomers alike.",,"Resident Evil: Village is a powerful monster, bolting together parts from Resident Evils 7, 4 and more besides. It’s longer than recent games in the series, yet still feels trim and sculpted as it shifts between it wide range of locations and set pieces. The downside of its eclectic approach is some unevenness, especially in a relatively weak opening act.",,"Similarly to Resident Evil 4 back in the day, Village will attract a new generation of players and redefine the franchise for the modern age. I guess it’s time to stop looking back and counting on the series to return to its roots. Capcom is well aware of those roots and willingly draws from them to create something new but still infused with Resident Evil’s spirit. Village is not perfect, but neither was RE4, and once again it’s easy to turn a blind eye to the flaws, because overall it’s an amazing game. [07/2021, p.56]",,"I don't think Resident Evil Village is going to be very divisive per se: I suspect the reaction will be generally positive. But it's going to definitely spark some conversations as to how it stacks up against the current darling of RE7, and it has a long hill to climb to match its success financially.","As it is, RE Village is simply a good game with excellent production value.","Resident Evil Village is a loud and bombastic game, paired with an over the top story, a great set of characters, and really impressive visuals. The more action-oriented gameplay approach in the latter half may leave a bitter taste to the more orthodox fans of the series, but nevertheless, Village is on its way to becoming one of the best games this year has to offer.","Feels like a love letter for the series that mixes and matches the best parts from previous games, while building upon the foundation laid out by Resident Evil 7.","Resident Evil: Village is going to make fans of the franchise happy, especially ones who aren't cowards like me. But even if you also find yourself shying away from the horror genre, I'd encourage you to screw your courage to the sticking place and consider a look at Capcom's latest survival horror stunner.",,,"Resident Evil Village earns a spot right up there as one of the very best Resident Evil games in the franchise’s 25 year run. Village is an amalgamation of what made Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 7 fan-favourite entries. Though it also delivers on it’s own ambition with new breeds of terrifying enemies never seen before in Resident Evil. The Village is a desolate, decrepit, dolorous setting but undeniably beautiful thanks to some of the best art direction ever seen in the series. In an age of day one patches and bugs, Resident Evil looks and runs flawlessly on the PlayStation 5 version used in this review. Resident Evil Village is a Game of the Year contender.","In the end, all these similarities and influences from Village's contemporaries both do and don't work. It feels in places pieced together, and in others truly exceptional in its genre. But the overarching experience is an undoubtedly fun one that expands on the foundations laid down by Resident Evil 7, and sets up the inevitable trilogy finale being planned for Resident Evil 9. Not all of the risks taken pay off, but when they do, Resident Evil Village is thrilling, spine-chilling and worthy continuation of the groundwork laid by its predecessor.","Resident Evil Village has managed to keep a series that has been going for 25 years feel new. The combat is satisfying, the puzzles are well-orchestrated, and it looks incredible.","The brilliance here – as with all the best Resident Evil games – is the way it switches modes when you least expect it. You can be deep in thought, wandering familiar corridors searching for the solution to a puzzle, when suddenly a werewolf leaps out at you from a previously safe place, or a creepy doll falls from a shelf, and you jump five feet off the sofa. At the same time, it is rife with the ludicrous: weird voice acting, an unfathomable plot, hokey environmental storytelling – but none of it really matters when you’re being chased up some stairs by a gigantic slime creature that giggles like a baby.","Resident Evil Village is a deliciously gruesome game. Ethan Winters gets it again and once more has to go through hell to save his family. This time no crazy family, but a bigger setting that gives you more freedom. Although the game is somewhat linear initially, the level of horror continues to rise but this time combined with more puzzles and exploring. The enemies are terrifying and next to that survival is truly back with the RE4-inventory system.","Village improves almost every aspect we enjoyed in RE 7 Biohazard. It is a great horror story set in Eastern Europe, with a perfect balance between combat, puzzles and exploration. But more is not always better, and sometimes it loses focus on the ""survival horror"" elements.","Celebrating its 25th anniversary, Resident Evil Village is a fitting tribute to the history of the franchise. Although some of the enigmatic characters are not given the screentime they deserve, they are incredibly realized through the environments that evoke the personality of its inhabitant. Perhaps the game could have taken more risks in this outing, however, this dastardly showcase of the macabre is intoxicating.","Resident Evil Village is superior to Resident Evil 7 in practically every aspect and this game makes Ethan Winters become one of the most important characters in the saga. Its classic horror atmosphere, its agility in the game and in the inventory and its simple puzzles make it a seamless experience that will delight all those who are fans of Resident Evil. It is the entry of this series that is the most distant from the other titles and for us it is an essential of this 2021.",,,,,"Resident Evil Village is a crown jewel in this ever-evolving series. The developers have combined elements from the two most prominent installments - 4 and 7 and added lots of new, interesting ideas. Then, they topped all this with a thick sauce of fantastic art direction and, behold! We got one of the best Resident Evil games and survival horrors in general.","Having multiple Lords to hunt and take down, each with their own unique territory and play style, greatly helps Village stand out from previous entries. Bringing back a merchant, giving hunting and fishing options, an upgraded inventory system, allowing the story to go absolutely off the rails, and switching the gameplay to be more action focused, even though I understand that may upset some players, all combined to help Village stand out from previous entries while still feeling unique. Upon completion I immediately spent my CP and hopped back into the campaign, the greatest compliment I can give any game. Village may very well be my new favorite entry in the series.","Overall, Resident Evil: Village is a solid entry into the franchise. It isn't quite up to the sheer excellence of Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 4, but it has a lot of genuinely fun moments and solid gameplay. The only thing that might hold it back is that it returns to the ridiculousness that Resident Evil loves to embrace, and that might disappoint fans who were hoping for something more grounded. If you're a Resident Evil fan who has stuck with the series through Alfred Ashford and Jake Muller, then you'll probably feel right at home with Village.","Resident Evil Village is more than a worthy sequel to the seventh part. The game cleverly manages to scare players through various gameplay styles. With an imposing game world, effective thrills and a variety of secrets, the game sets a course that we would like to see in future installments.",The strong point of Resident Evil Village is variety: it's a great survival horror that offers the best of the genre at once.,"While Resident Evil Village channels the best bits of several Resident Evil games, it stands on its own to be something never done before in the franchise. A macabre potpourri of European, gothic inspired styles of tension and horror, Resident Evil Village is a worthy follow-up to Resident Evil 7: biohazard and one that any self-respecting horror fan shouldn’t miss.",Resident Evil Village is a great addition to the beloved franchise mixing the best of old and new to create a balanced addition for fans of all types. The end will leave you with your jaw on the floor and anxiously awaiting the next chapter for the franchise. I am excited to see what lies ahead.,"Village is a best of the series in a positive sense, which appears in a fresh guise and yet feels comfortably familiar.",,,,"Resident Evil Village is one of the best entries in the series, hands down. It has some minor issues, but nothing to interfere with the overall experience. There are tons of extras and plenty of replay value from new levels of difficulty, to new weapons, challenges to the new Mercenary mode. You will have to discover this for yourself, along with the story, since we do not want to cross into spoiler territory. You can rest assured that although the innovations are not as obvious as in the case of Biohazard, Village refines the gameplay experience and fixes the shortcomings and critics of the previous episode. We highly recommend Resident Evil Village to all fans of video games.","Resident Evil Village is both a beautiful and worthy successor to Resident Evil 7 biohazard. And it is more than just a sequel that rehashes ideas seen in the previous game. Capcom's game tries things that have never been seen before in the series and keeps things moving at the right pace with a few good twists along the way. It also must be said that Capcom's developers masterfully used both light and sound to put the player in Ethan's shoes. The only problem with the game is that it may be a bit too action-oriented near the end. That being said, Resident Evil Village is undoubtedly a great Resident Evil game.",,"The eighth main entry in Capcom's long-running series isn't perfect due to some graphical imperfections and a lack of weight in the guns you start out with. However, we dare anyone to genuinely care when the rest of the game is this great. Resident Evil celebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary in style, with an always beautiful, often scary, regularly exhilarating and surprisingly emotional adventure. Worth every single penny.","The intricate puzzles and precisely-calculated enemy placement endow the games with a mechanical flare akin to fine watchwork. When a video game makes cliches enjoyable, it’s impossible to not notice the craft of its game design.","While the Resident Evil series has been on a high for a number of years now, Resident Evil Village sets an entirely new standard. Its cast of villains is up there with the very best, memorable sequences and gameplay sections beg to be played over and over again, and a sense of constant dread created by the atmosphere and soundtrack keeps you on the edge of your seat. Even the combat is solid this time around and the lengths Capcom has gone to take advantage of the PS5 pays off with impressive Ray-Tracing. Does it better Resident Evil 4? Maybe not, but it's damn close. Real damn close. Resident Evil Village is an essential playthrough for anyone with even a passing interest in the franchise.","Resident Evil Village leaves its comfort zone and takes risks by integrating new elements of action, suspense and combat that are out of the ordinary in the saga, resulting in one of the best experiences. However, it sacrifices details such as puzzle complexity and overall gameplay, so now it feels less like a challenge for more experienced players.","It’s good, but it could have been better. Village moves the Resident Evil franchise away from horror and firmly into mainstream territory. You can play this even if you don’t like being scared.","Resident Evil Village is one of the most versatile instalments of the franchise when it comes to environments, enemies and puzzles. It’s a rollercoaster of memorable moments, nasty body horror and fan service. But like most funfair rides it doesn’t offer much in the way of sideshows and the fun is over way too quickly. But you can always go again!","A competent but uninspired sequel that’s unwise to create so many obvious comparisons to Resident Evil 4, although it still manages to find some memorable moments of its own.","More accomplished than its predecessor from whom it shamelessly steals its structure, Resident Evil Village is a complete experience filling with quiet strength all the necessary boxes for the success of an action-oriented first-person survival horror. Although it draws its inspiration from the depths of the Spanish oblivion belonging to the fourth installment, the title of Capcom manages to perform well thanks to its atmosphere tinged with original fantasy for the saga. The unforgivable absence of virtual reality and the presence of a feeling of ""already played"", however, prevent him from claiming the title of eminent village chief. Not enough to initiate a parochial dispute, however: this new Resident Evil is a success.","Reaching the credits, I sat back, exhausted and disappointed at where the series had ended up.",,"Resident Evil Village is a good game with a lot of opportunity to have been a great game. And yet, for as many criticisms as I have, it was an experience that I was happy to play through a second time immediately after finishing the first. The new setting, creatures, villains, and story are engaging additions to the Resident Evil canon, even if the gameplay doesn’t seem to have evolved all that much and the scares have been pulled back. It’s still a fun romp in a new setting with new monsters; a great and fitting piece of the broader series that makes me excited to see where it’s all headed next.",,Resident Evil: Village is the perfect meeting point between the action and survival horror soul of the legendary Capcom series. It is the natural evolution of the seventh chapter and one of the best iterations of the franchise to date.,"Resident Evil Village maintains some of the basic mechanics of its predecessor, but simultaneously refines and modernizes the gameplay with a new, improved progress system and stronger open world components. The direct sequel to Ethan Winter's adventure also has some strong links to Resident Evil 4 and combines established elements of the classic with a new inventory and crafting system, that leads to more comfort, without reducing the survival horror atmosphere or the so important lack of resources of the genre. Resident Evil Village is also the best-looking part of the series, with the best stage quality and perhaps with the most thrilling story yet. It's not a perfect game, but still one of the best Resident Evil games yet and absolutely a must- buy for every fan of the series and this type of game.",,"We expected an exceptional title and Capcom did not lie to us: Resident Evil Village is a great game and above all a great Resident Evil. A true mix between the horror of the seventh episode and the meticulous action of the fourth part, this new opus is the result of a particularly well calibrated and complete experience.",,"At times it can feel like you’re being led, but rerunning the story reveals more details, secrets, and reasons to love Resident Evil Village. Close to Resi perfection. [Issue#2, p.66]","Resident Evil Village is good proof of what the franchise is capable of, looking for the variety of environments, situations and enemies. But trying to cover so much, sometimes the game is not as consistent as I would like, with a more basic and linear level design. [Recommended]","Play RE7 first. If you want more of the same, lower your general expectations and revel in RE Village's improved gunplay. If not, skip.","Sackable offences? Of course not. And for all these flaws, Resident Evil Village was a thrilling adventure that kept me hooked from beginning to end, despite its jarring twists and turns. But the delightful level design isn't enough to mitigate a strange, unsatisfying, plothole-ridden story, and that bizarre final act ultimately sullies what is an otherwise terrifyingly good horror romp.","Some say it takes a village to do a quick look, others say it only takes Brad and Vinny. Sit back and enjoy as the Giant Bomb team takes an unedited look at Resident Evil Village.","Village may not live up to the potential of its immediate predecessor, but it’s a safe new entry in the series that induces the same entertaining anxiety as my favorite Resident Evil games and provides a few interesting wrinkles for where the franchise might go next.","Built like a Disneyland of horror tropes and gore, the eponymous village funnels you toward gory sights and sounds, with Ethan circling a drain of carnage.","Eventually, the swings between horror and action became so common that, moment to moment, I had no idea what I’d see next. That’s the cycle that Resident Evil Village keeps chasing: the hesitation, anticipation, and payoff that make both action and horror such powerful draws. It’s definitely an action game, and despite all the shooting, it’s also a horror game. And while it induces both creeping dread and righteous fury, its biggest triumph is in not-so-quietly arguing that horror and action aren’t that different after all. They’re both just ways to get your blood pumping. [Polygon Recommends]","When Capcom released Resident Evil 7, not only did it reinvent the Resident Evil series, but reinvented mainstream horror games as we know them. Boasting an incredible first half, Resident Evil Village is a fantastic and worthy follow-up, even though it regrettably drags on near the end.","Resident Evil Village is at once terrifying, exhilarating, hilarious, and beautiful. Its crowning achievement is that it’s a horror game that’s not only perfectly paced, but it also has an explosive third act and ends on its highest note. It isn’t enough to dethrone Resident Evil 4 as an action title, but it’s a marked improvement over 7’s solid foundation.","The latest main entry to the series is a great game that offers more situations than your average Resident Evil, and successfully manages to create a memorable adventure, but also feels irregular and fails to reach the greatness of the best titles in the franchise.","Resident Evil Village is a great survival horror game that leans into the action and silliness of earlier entries in the series to mixed results. It's not as good as Resident Evil 7, and it's not as good as Resident Evil 4. It feels like a strange mixture of the two, and while it seems like it might be able to strike a good balance in its first half, the second half dashes any hope of that.",Lady Dimitrescu’s towering presence is just the tip of the iceberg of what Resident Evil Village offers. This game takes everything you know about the iconic horror series and dials it up to eleven.,"Resident Evil Village is like a reunion of all the previous games in the series. It takes what worked and gives it to fans in small bites across this horrifying adventure. Tension is created in multiple ways that force you to adjust on the fly, but as scary as it, the thought that answers to all your questions lie beyond the next door will keep you playing long into the night. Resident Evil Village isn’t having an identity crisis. It’s fully aware of what it’s doing. Somehow, the blending of these systems produces the most entertaining nightmare you’ve ever had.",,,"Resident Evil Village expertly combines tense horror, thrilling action, engaging exploration, and compelling storytelling in a single sublime experience, delivering one of the best games in the history of Capcom's beloved survival horror franchise.","Resident Evil Village feels like such a culmination. Bringing together elements from the franchise all the way up to now and crafting what looks to be the next step of survival horror, it embraces every aspect of the franchise. While the insidious dread of Resident Evil VII is missing, there are still plenty of scares. The monster designs are fantastic, from the generations undead, the fury of the Lupine beasts, to the towering monstrosities. It's well worth delving into the concept art and 3D models to enjoy them fully. The story is just the right amount of silly with the terrifying, and the odd dash of the surreal. The combat is smooth and fluid, best evidenced in the addictive Mercenaries mode. All of these elements added together make quite possibly the best Resident Evil to date, and a foundation for a fresh new generation of terror.","Resident Evil Village proves to be an excellent evolution of the previous chapter: there is tension, exploration, combat, everything you could want and even more.","A great way to close a cycle and kick off a new phase, in the hope of finding less action and more tension in the future. Together with that atavistic and visceral evil that crawls through the machinations of Umbrella, and under the rotten skin of his creatures.","Resident Evil Village is an instant classic, a solid basis for the franchise's future and the perfect mixture between the beloved game structure of Resident Evil 4 and the modern take on franchise reinvented by Resident Evil 7.",,"This game manages to find new ways to thrill, excite, and stomp all over your poor, terrified little heart – which we suppose is great for people who have that sort of kink. Whatever floats your boat, we suppose.","Resident Evil Village sets out to do exactly what Capcom planned and that's offering players a well-rounded, gore-filled fright-fest.",,,,"Without forgetting the past, and again with Ethan Winters as lead character Resident Evil Village picks different celebrated elements from the franchise throughout the years and adapts them to the modern first-person view format, in an adventure that explores different atmospheres and dimensions of interactive terror, alternating between action moments and total despair. It is not revolutionary, but it is the most complete RE ever, without fear of treading supernatural paths and trapping itself in narrative alleys.","Taken alone, any one slice of the game – like a single house, the village itself, even the way combat handles – has its issues. But combined, it merges into something that’s still special – even if it isn’t quite as brilliant as Resident Evil 7 or 2 Remake. It’s an easy recommendation – though if you didn’t back in 2017, you might want to play RE7 first.",,Resident Evil Village is a genuinely engrossing and increasingly combat-heavy continuation of the Ethan Winters story.,,,,,,"Even with these flaws accounted for, there’s no doubt that Resident Evil Village is a great title by its own merits and a fantastic entry into the Resident Evil franchise. Longtime fans will find plenty to love about the game and the innovations it brings to the table, while newer fans will discover more than a few reasons to stick with the series moving forward.","Resident Evil Village is an essential horror experience that shows off what Capcom is capable of when it doesn’t compromise its vision in any way. The developer uses subgenres like puzzle pieces, clicking them into place on a grid to reveal the bigger picture: a survival horror collage, realised with remarkable production values and a deep love for its extensive roots. Resident Evil Village will be held high by Lady Dimitrescu and her peers for years to come, to rest head and shoulders above its genre rivals.","After the too close for comfort clash with the Baker family in Louisana, Resident Evil Village attempts to match that creepy tone and do more. Much more. As a result, this tale has facets of methodical horror combined with the ridiculous action of Resident Evil 5 or 6. While some players may not enjoy one or the other, undeniably Capcom does both very well. A better mix of the survival horror and extreme action could have made this stronger overall, as the messy pacing, lacking antagonist development, and easing difficulty hurt the overall adventure. The final package is still a wonderful spectacle of a video game. It’s entertaining, it’s engrossing, and it’s Resident Evil in every aspect. With the best visual/audio design in the series’ and a satisfying Metroidvania world design, Resident Evil Village is unmissable.","Resident Evil Village expands the pared-back, first-person gameplay of Resident Evil 7 into a more ambitious and over-the-top survival horror experience. Greater variety and more mechanical depth prove that there’s a lot of potential left to explore in this new approach to the series, but some elements are a bit uneven, and you may find yourself missing the simplicity of the Baker ranch.","Capcom delivers a horror carnival with a ringmaster, who wants to deliver the maximum amount of beasts, stunts and clowns. You will experience spectacular boss fights and beautiful audio as well as visuals, but also quite a few embarrassments and frustrating elements.",,,"Resident Evil Village never reaches the highs set by its older sibling, but it is far more consistent throughout while also delivering far more content. It does not overstay its welcome and delivers a quality experience that values its time. It is both a beautiful and thrilling game that is a must-play for any fan or newcomer.","Resident Evil manages to prove once again that its DNA is not static, and that it has the ability to evolve in the same way as the viruses and biological weapons that its protagonists have fought for so many years. In more ways than one, Resident Evil Village is a huge tribute to 25 years of tradition, and an important stepping stone to its future.","A great Resident Evil capable of taking the best gameplay ideas from Resident Evil 4 and 7, leading the series into a new era.",,"Village doesn’t pull any punches when it comes to horror, but a consistent rollout of new weapons and tools makes it hard to walk away from these terrors.",,"Barring remakes, Resident Evil Village is the best entry in the series since Resident Evil 4.",,"Village is an intense Resident Evil experience, with a great cast of heroes and villains. While it does not lack great moments, its story also feels a little jumbled and non-cohesive, and some gameplay elements are not perfectly focused.",,,"Resident Evil Village is a worthwhile addition to Capcom’s survival horror franchise. It’s an explosive and brutal thrill ride that will surely please fans of Resident Evil 4 or those who enjoyed Resident Evil 7 but felt it could use a bit more action. While I don’t think I’d call it my personal favorite entry in the series (that honor goes to Resident Evil 2), I feel Capcom has done an admirable job of combining the strengths of two of the franchise’s most memorable titles to create something new and exciting. If you’re a fan of the series, then this is one game that absolutely deserves a spot in your PS5 library.","Resident Evil Village is an enjoyable horror experience that embraces the franchise’s first-person approach and refines a few of its mechanics along the way. It’s ultimately held back by a sloppy storyline, two-dimensional characters and bizarre design choices.","Resident Evil: Village takes the ground work from the seventh part and mixes it together with the very best from the previous Resident Evil titles. It enchants and shocks us at the same time, to the point that we become completely addicted to it. A contemporary classic that sets a new standard, just as Resident Evil 4 once did.","Despite some important shortcomings, Resident Evil Village manages to offer an atmosphere of horror that you can enjoy from beginning to end.","Resident Evil Village takes everything you loved about the franchise and combined it with some homages to classic and modern horror to create something unique in video games today. It's an absolute spectacle, showing off the best of the RE Engine and the PS5 as a bonus.","It’s a great time to be a Resident Evil fan. This Village rounds up everything you expect from the brand, and does it very well too, with a great variety of gameplay, twists and an incredible setting. Survival Horror has never been this satisfying.","On PlayStation 5, Village looks and sounds exceptional. Locations are intricately crafted, as each new room you step into is packed with eye catching details to investigate. Paranoia easily sets in as you hear enemies lurking in dense foliage and adjacent rooms. With ray tracing on, the visuals look marginally better, but the performance takes frequent, noticeable dips. Turning it off yields a steady 60 frames-per-second. Resident Evil Village’s imposing environments lay the groundwork for exhilarating action and slow, creeping fear. Exploration and resource management are among the best of the series. A few story elements miss the mark, and Mercenaries is over too quickly, but Village is another remarkable entry in the long-running survival horror series.",,"Resident Evil Village does great as an action game with solid horror elements. The combat is visceral and vibrant, the environments are splendid and mysterious, and the story had decent enough oomph to keep me involved throughout.","Resident Evil Village is a technical masterpiece, featuring a fantastically realised and foreboding setting with a great sense of balance between action and horror elements. The king of survival horror refuses to relinquish its crown.","Resident Evil 7 was an excellent return to the horror underpinnings of the franchise, but cunningly altered with new ideas and a new perspective. Similarly, Village is an intelligent reintroduction of the best action elements of Resident Evil. Though it captures some of the same things that made RE7 such a breath of fresh air (or maybe rancid, stale, mold-filled air, but in a good way), Village evolves to become its own unique creature. It makes you wonder what beautifully twisted fiend Resident Evil might mutate into in the future.","As an entire experience there is a lot on offer, and the game encourages multiple playthroughs with a number of difficulty settings, Mercenaries, Treasures and more to find and unlock. I wasn’t wholly sold on werewolves and vampires and fairytale zombies initially, but as I progressed through the game, my inner cryptozoologist emerged and I just left all scepticism at the gate and enjoyed the game for what it is: more outlandish and out there, is more better.","With as far as Village reaches and as much as it tries to incorporate into one short experience, it has more successes than shortcomings to show for its efforts. It’s not perfect, though it shows how Resident Evil can grow outside of its comfort zones while still managing to pay respects to history and satisfy all types of players.",,,,,"Resident Evil Village boils all the best and worst parts of the franchise down into an eclectic, though uneven experience.","There is no doubt that Village is a great Resi entry, with more variety and sheer bombast than its predecessor ever delivered. In prizing its many made-for-Twitch-and-YouTube moments over tone and consistency, it falls short as an evolution of the franchise. Village is still a bold, silly and beautiful thing, but there’s no avoiding a murkier focus and a less compelling story resulting is a slightly mish-mashed “Best Of”. One that’s easy to love when you’re caught between its vicious gothic claws and a little forgettable once they’ve relinquished themselves.","Resident Evil Village is a slick, atmospheric addition to the franchise, and it bookends the story started in Resident Evil 7 beautifully. Every area is dripping with dark personality and it's filled with memorable characters, while fun combat and a satisfying upgrade system keep things fresh throughout your adventure. Higher difficulties, the Mercenaries mode and other fun unlockables will keep hardcore players coming back after they've beaten the story, so there's plenty of value and challenge beyond the main game. It could definitely be a bit scarier and more difficult, and the final major area isn't quite as visually arresting or fun to explore as earlier ones, but it's a strong start for the series on next-gen consoles and a delightful tribute to the series on its 25th anniversary.",,"If you’re in it for the outlandish characters and labyrinthine level design, you’ll probably love Village. If you’d hoped 7 would spark a fresh new direction for the series, though, you might be disappointed.",,"Ultimately the most memorable and enjoyable parts of Village are all contained in its meaty middle section; a melting pot of inspirations and inventive all-new horrifying scenarios that, in certain moments, marries the best parts of the series’ two greatest entries. Unfortunately those moments are fleeting, but the game manages to frighten and excite throughout.","Resident Evil Village is a wild, thrilling ride across seemingly every horror genre and idea that happened to pass through the mad minds at Capcom. Not every aspect of the game is perfect, but its highs are very high and solid core mechanics and excellent presentation hold the grisly patchwork together. You may survive Resident Evil Village, but your thoughts will linger there long after you’ve escaped.","Resident Evil Village continues the story of Resident Evil 7, keeping its playable mechanics and adding new ideas that offer an adventure full of mystery and terror. His argument will convince fans of the saga from the beginning. Makes the most of the technology of PlayStation 5.",,,,,,,,,,"As the credits rolled on Resident Evil Village, I was struck by just how much of the back quarter of the game felt like a desperate attempt to work Ethan Winters and his arc into the greater Resident Evil narrative. This, much more than its action emphasis, is what is frustrating about Village. For the second game in a row, Resident Evil has shown that it has outgrown its conventions, that it can create fresh horrors in new places. And still, everything must come crashing to a halt so that the curtain can be pulled back on the same threadbare wizard we've seen for 25 years.","A Resident Evil that moves away from zombies in favour of gothic horror and European folklore was always going to be something unique and impressive, and Village certainly delivers. But it's so much more than that, too; not just a new take on Resident Evil, but a reflection on the series' genre-defining history. And with its anthology-like structure that so effortlessly traverses so many different horror subgenres and styles of storytelling, it goes one further: it's a reflection on horror itself. In that, Resident Evil Village is magnificent.",,,,"Resident Evil Village is what you get when you take the first-person horror of Resident Evil 7 and combine it with the more action-focused gameplay of Resident Evil 4. Ultimately, it ends up being a love letter to fans of the series, or even just fans of specific games like RE4 and RE7; a fitting title to celebrate the series’ 25th anniversary this year. Clocking in at around eight hours for my first playthrough, I never felt bored as I explored the village. There was always something new to discover and each new piece of the story had me yearning for more. After the story, The Mercenaries mode and completing challenges to unlock weapons and infinite ammo have more than kept me entertained as I work my way through my third playthrough.",,,,"Resident Evil Village shines brightly as one of this year’s early Game of the Year contenders. Whether you’re a fan of the series or a survival horror fan in general, be sure to pick it up.",,,"Resident Evil Village is as good a place to start as any if you're a newcomer to the series. The game takes pains to open itself up to new players with its action-orientated gameplay, supernatural story, and a cast of great villains to sell the package. I'm sold and Resident Evil now has a new fan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sucker Punch's ability to weave beautiful narratives that will, ahem, sucker punch you right in the feels is more in the spotlight here than ever, and it's an utter success.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Iki Island is an excellent add-on for fans of the main game who want to feast even more on the delicious samurai buffet after an extended break.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Iki island is just more Ghost of Tsushima. I wish it had done more to differentiate its action, or tell a bolder story. There are definitely good reasons to visit Iki. I won’t soon forget that moonlight filling the cloudy sky. But it’s too conventional an expansion to be the bid for greatness that this game’s vivid world deserves.",,"The care present in Ghost of Tsushima’s design makes its undercooked take on its own ideas harder to forgive. Take its themes seriously, and it becomes a story about a feudal landlord learning that maybe life isn’t about him, but centering on him anyway. The Jin Sakai that players engage with through play — the Jin Sakai that composes haikus, loves animals enough to play them little tunes on his flute, who never met a row of bamboo he did not want to cut for fun — seems to have the interiority that the Jin Sakai of Ghost of Tsushima’s narrative does not. One is a thoughtful guy you might want to hang around. The other is not. He’s kind of embarrassing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’re looking for 10-15 hours more of Ghost of Tsushima but with a greater emphasises on the inner struggles of Jin and an exploration of his backstory coupled with some meaty side quests, cat petting and disgustingly stunning scenery, you really can’t go wrong with taking on the island of Iki.",,,,,,,"Iki Island doesn't do much beyond just offering more Ghost of Tsushima, but the new content is extremely worthwhile, thanks to a story that dives deeper into Jin's past, a few new combat wrinkles, and plenty of secrets to discover.",,,,,,"Despite those shortcomings, there’s no question that Ghost of Tsushima Iki Island is an entertaining overall experience and I’m confident most players will find it worth the asking price; in particular, because the story strengthens Jin’s character arc by shining a light on an aspect of his youth not particularly well explained in the base game. For that reason, it works as an adventure played alongside the base game, and equally as an engaging new chapter for those playing it after the fact.",,,,,,,"Where some expansions expand on the gameplay with core changes and new systems, Ghost of Tsushima's Iki Island acts more like an extension of the main game loved by so many - with only minor yet appreciated tweaks. For the most part, in conjunction with changes to enemy combat skills and exploration, along with turning your horse into a weapon, playing through Iki fits wonderfully into this originally three-act epic as a welcome fourth. Ever so slightly dusted with imperfections, the captivating story, combat, graphics, and soundtrack are all still among the very best PlayStation exclusives have to offer, mostly overshadowing any grievances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Where Iki Island excels, though, is in adding some new dimensions to the rest of Ghost of Tsushima. Its exploration of Jin's backstory and his character bring more depth to the base game's tale that improve it overall, and its beautiful new landscape provides both more of what works about vanilla Ghost and a few good, if slight, tweaks on the formula. Nothing is a drastic departure, but it's a lot more of the good stuff, refreshing Sucker Punch's already solid open-world game and providing some interesting reasons to revisit it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-pedestrian,,,,,,,,The Pedestrian is an ace collection of puzzles thematically linked by some very clever set dressing as you traverse 3D environments via 2D puzzles. It's really quite good. Get on it.,,,,,"Well thought out puzzles and a fantastic art style really propel The Pedestrian to the top of my list of recently played puzzle games. It is so different and that is something I really admire. While it will not be for everyone I think it does enough to even tease non-puzzle game fans into trying it. Striking and clever, The Pedestrian never overstays its welcome. It's short, sweet and I enjoyed every minute of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Pedestrian is a beautiful game that permeates with ingenuity. Each area is brimming with ideas and these are suitably positioned to not overwhelm the gamer. Due to its design, players of any skill level will be able to jump on and enjoy this unique title. Unfortunately, there are a few road bumps along the way and the conclusion of the subtle narrative is a bit of a dead-end but this doesn’t take away from the incredible journey across the city.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Pedestrian does its job well as a unique puzzle game and leaves out all the bells and whistles around it, including a story. For many, the biggest stumbling block could be the missing help function. If you're stuck with a sign puzzle and can't get any further, it can be frustrating. But if you are motivated to the tips of your hair and want to master the clever puzzles yourself, you won't be particularly bothered.",,,,,,,,,"While The Pedestrian is a great puzzle platformer, it's not perfect. Probably the most noticeable absence in the game is a hint system. The puzzles can get extremely difficult at times, becoming borderline frustrating even. Additionally, another missed opportunity is in the game’s use of the touchpad. While pressing the touchpad works as the interact button, the cursor cannot be controlled by sliding your finger over it. This nitpick might not affect many players, but it’s still an odd exclusion. Minor frustrations aside, The Pedestrian is a fantastic puzzle-platformer that stands out from the crowd. For those looking for a unique pick-up-and-play experience, it's well worth the investment.",,,,,,,,"As with most of the best puzzle games out there, The Pedestrian isn’t going to eat up a huge chunk of your time. That said, every minute spent playing it will give your brain a solid workout. My first session saw me burn through the first half of the game in an afternoon before my noggin needed some downtime. As the puzzles ramped up in difficulty, it slowed me down a touch but only because I was being much more deliberate and triple checking everything. Putting this one up there as one of the best puzzlers available for PlayStation gamers, right below A Fold Apart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The small ""pedestrian"" experience of Skookum Arts shows off a rare and precious creative intelligence, so accessible and at the same time witty in its continuous games of logic, without ever neglecting an artistic component which, far from being a mere support to the action , points directly to the sight and heart of the player, making an almost perfect center.",,,,"While it may not be for everyone, The Pedestrian is worth a shot. It stands out from the crowd in so many ways, leaving a positive impact on me in the end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’re tired of 2.5D puzzle-platformers with a horror tinge, The Pedestrian’s signswitching action will serve as a refreshing roadside alternative.

It starts off strong and carries that energy throughout the rest of the adventure, dishing out new mechanics and obstacles at a comfortable pace that never had me feeling bored or disinterested.

In addition, it is a nostalgic journey through the history of PlayStation that has touched our hearts.",,,"Astro’s Playroom is an exciting 3D platformer full of surprise and wonder. While its task of introducing the PS5 controller’s new features can sometimes be a double-edged sword, full-fledged implementation of the DualSense’s haptic feedback creates a next-gen experience only possible on the PS5. The game design of adding new ideas for each level, iterating on them, and then switching them for something completely different is reminiscent of Nintendo’s design philosophy, and Astro does it just as well as Mario. At the same time, Astro’s adventure through the history of PlayStation is a journey only Sony can deliver.",,"Believe me when I tell you that as soon as your PS5 is ready, what you should do before anything else, is to start playing Astro's Playroom.

Its world is vibrant and wonderfully detailed, and it looks exceptional on the PS5. But in all honesty, this isn’t so much a game as it is a showpiece for what the DualSense controller can do.

I’m not a technically minded gamer, and for me the appeal of individual consoles has always been decidedly secondary to the games I can play on them. But there is proper magic in how engineers and programmers create the machines that enable our gaming experiences, and Astro’s Playroom helped me to see it.",Although Astro's Playroom does feature a few gimmicks it's undeniable that this game is an amazing showcase for the PS5's DualSense.

And it's free. What a pity that it ends very soon.","Alas, Astro’s Playroom is only a few astonishing, magical hours long. There are lots of collectibles to go after and a leaderboard driven speedrun mode, but when I finished, I was still hungry for more. And that’s kind of the only criticism I can levy against it.

It’s the foundational software kicking off the next generation of PlayStation gaming. ASOBI Team from Japan Studio could have just phoned it in with a handful of gimmicky levels to distract players while they wait for Miles Morales or Demon’s Souls to download, but they didn’t. They developed a full fun platforming experience that not only demonstrates the PS5, but celebrates 25 years of PlayStation history in some pretty special ways.

The cameos are plentiful and amusing, with franchises that go beyond the first-party catalogue, along with some surprisingly deep cuts that made me feel very old. But in the midst of all that history, Astro feels like an adorably fresh face; I’m glad to see the character break out of the confines of VR and reach out to a broader audience. Astro’s Playroom may not be the deepest or most ambitious game on PS5, but its humor and playfulness are just delightful.",,,"Aside from being a showcase of the tech that the PlayStation 5 is capable of, Astro’s Playroom excels in its exuding charm, with callbacks and references to many PlayStation properties sprinkled throughout the entirety of the game.

The DualSense proves to be an exceptional controller with absolutely unique sensory possibilities, capable of bringing the player even closer to the gameplay. Not a traumatic revolution, but still one that leads to a new and unknown level of intimacy that, apart from VR, had never been reached in a “traditional” video game.

The speaker, the motion controls (when limited to simple motions only), the impressive HD rumble, the adaptive triggers, it’s all here and impressive. Playing off the in-game visuals and surround sound coming through your headset or speaker setup it’s as much a proof of concept as it is a fine 3D platformer and a celebration of all things PlayStation.

It obviously includes the base game, but also comes with the story DLC that came out with the expansion pass. Both add new narrative beats to the game.

If you don’t want the baggage of over 8 plus titles over your head, this is currently a one and done title, however you want to see what else has happened in Kamurocho, you also have the option to explore the main line series (which included “free” on Gamepass via Microsoft). Either way you’ll definitely see the studio in a different light if you play this title.","As mentioned, this remaster is geared for newcomers and so it's the best way to experience the game, even if it isn't a must-play for those who already experienced it on last-gen.","In sum, Judgment on the PS5 is a must-have for those that haven’t already paid or played through it on PS4. Unfortunately, previous owners cannot get a free upgrade, but, at least the MSRP for Judgment on PS5 is $40. This release does not offer anything new as far as gameplay, but, it is complete, runs like silk, and reminds us all how good of a game this was two years ago and still is today. Not to mention, its arrival is likely foreshadowing the imminent announcement of a sequel.",,,,"Judgment on PS5 is the best version of a great game, with no hiccups in the transition to current-gen consoles and a few exceptional benefits for players to enjoy. Judgment remains, like a crucial discovery in Yagami's case, strong evidence that Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio knows its way around compelling crime narratives in a way few other developers can aspire towards. Like its setting, it's not perfect in any sense, but also like Kamurocho, the flaws are another reason to get drawn in, and Judgment on PS5 is a must-play for anyone who enjoys a good detective story.",,,,"Despite being a spin-off, Judgment firmly stands on its own two feet, offering a great story, immensely fun combat and the usual truckload of cool side stories and engaging activities scattered around Kamurocho. The main plot line has some pacing issues and the detective mechanics are shallow, but you should definitely give this game a try, even if you don’t care much for the Yakuza series. [07/2021, p.68]",,,,"Next gen console systems gave a new life to an already beautiful game. Judgment have plenty of unique charm, even compared to other games in main Yakuza series, so if you like Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio games, and a good detective story is something you can enjoy, then don't miss this title.",,,,"Ultimately, the gameplay tweaks found in Judgment manage to successfully differentiate it from the Yakuza series while still retaining the elements that have made it such a hit with fans. You have the hard-hitting combat, which is more more energetic than ever thanks to Yagami’s agility, an engaging story full of twists and turns, and a varied range of activities to preoccupy you in between meeting the story objectives. The investigative elements simply add to the variety that’s on offer, and make you feel more involved in the goings-on in and around Kamurocho. If you’ve already played the game on PS4 then there’s little here to warrant a replay. But if not, you should definitely consider picking Judgment up now that it’s available on more formats whether you’re a Yakuza fan or not.",,,,,,"Judgment for PS5 is even better: a great detective story set in Kamurocho, with 4K resolution, 60 FPS and small changes in minigames It also includes every DLC (items for Yagami Office and consumables).","Judgment has its flaws, but it does give you a fresh take on the established Yakuza formula, and the story and characters bring some much-needed realism that sets the game apart. The gameplay additions, while they don’t always hit the mark, at least represent an attempt to keep things interesting. If you haven’t yet played Judgment, this new Remastered version is absolutely the way to play it. Disappointingly, it doesn’t offer any new content, but it does improve on the graphics, frame rate and load times to a degree that vastly improves the experience.",,,,,,,"Judgement is a fantastic Yakuza game, but the spinoff’s other elements can feel half baked. Brawling and investigating can both be fun, but it’s clear there’s depth missing from both aspects. The PS5 version is a blanket upgrade, with improved lighting, textures, and load times, but could have used a bit more care to preserve the artistic choices of the original.","All in all, Judgment is still one of the better titles in the Yakuza franchise. The biggest flaw it had and continues to have is that it feels a bit too familiar and a bit too safe, but it's a lot easier to accept that in the wake of Yakuza: Like A Dragon. The plot is interesting, the characters are fun, the gameplay is charming, and overall, it's just a darn good game. If you're looking for another entry in the Yakuza franchise, then Judgment is the way to go. Now we just have to wait for news about the upcoming sequel....",,,"Judgment on the new generation of consoles might not be a must-play for anyone who already enjoyed it on the PS4, but it's absolutely the best way to play the game and still represents a fantastic jumping off point for anyone keen to dip their toes into the Yakuza franchise. Playing as Yagami feels better than ever at 60FPS, and Kamurocho and its many faces come alive with improved detail and a fantastic new lighting treatment. There's no argument here: Judgment is a winner, case closed.",,,,,,,,,,,"Judgment is a truly gripping detective thriller, and it plays better than ever on PS5. As a standalone adventure, it's an excellent action RPG, boasting some outstanding storytelling and a brilliant cast of characters. And as a Yakuza spinoff, it's arguably the perfect gateway into SEGA's stellar series.",,,,,"The thriller dimension and new gameplay mechanics are blowing a wind of renewal on the series. In addition, the fighting remains intense and epic in the heart of a district of Kamurocho larger than life. The presence of French subtitles plays the role of icing on a very appetizing cake.",,,,,,,,,,"It’s not much cop as a detective game, but this spin-off from the Yakuza series is still a terrific yarn that’s held up by its charming sense of place and character. [Issue#2, p.86]","This edition of Judgment is limited, but it contains the improvements the game needed over the original version: high resolution and 60 frames per second. However, it is enough to enjoy a very fun game that surprises with the variety of mechanics, missions and activities that we could perform.",,,,,,,,,"This remaster updates the original adventure for the new consoles with virtually no additions beyond the visuals. However, it’s a great opportunity to enjoy this game on PS5 and Xbox Series X.","Judgment is proof that the Yakuza formula works even with a fresh set of faces. I really hope we get to see more of these characters in a sequel or future spinoff, especially if the detective side content gets a little more love the next time around.",,"Judgment on next-gen consoles provided a completely new experience through some amazing visual updates. I was genuinely immersed in the world and felt more attached to the narrative than I have ever been before. If you have yet to experience this game, then do yourself a favor and play this version. On the other hand, if you're looking to run around Kamurocho again as a Detective Yagami, then this is the perfect way to replay the adventure.",,,"By and large, if you already have Judgment on the PS4, its remaster is hard to recommend. There isn’t much that’s new here, after all, and spending additional money on a nearly identical experience doesn’t make much sense. That said, if you’ve never played Judgment before, this is an extremely easy recommendation. It tells an excellent story, offers a ton of varied and enjoyable content, and delivers an extremely polished take on the classic Yakuza formula.",The definitive version of Judgment is here! It is an almost perfect blend of incredible details and mechanics reinforced by a huge technical upgrade. A long and impressive title that takes the Ryu Ga Gotoku game design and maxes it out for a new side story while their main game goes in another direction. Heartily recommended!,"Judgment comes to PS5 with a higher resolution, 60 FPS and almost instant loading times: the perfect way to experience this excellent Yakuza spin-off.",,,,,,,,,Judgment is a Yakuza spin-off game that presents a captivating thriller investigation narrative. The slow start and less-than-stellar detective gameplay don’t keep the game from being a solid option for anyone who wants to take their first steps into the Yakuza universe.,,,,,,,,,"If you’ve not yet experienced the game — or just thoroughly enjoyed the original release — then the Judgement PS5 version – and I imagine the Series X|S versions – are the absolute best way to experience Kamurocho through the eyes of a detective. The visuals are better than ever, the 60fps framerate really amplifies the fluidity of Dragon Engine and combat, and load times are near non-existent. It may take a little while to get going, but once it has got its claws in you, it’ll be difficult to put down.",,,,On PS5 (and Xbox Series) you’ll get the best version of Judgment. Framerates of the spiritual Yakuza successor are doubled and microtransaction are omitted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you never got the chance to play this underappreciated gem, it’s well worth checking it out on new-gen consoles. Prior knowledge of the Yakuza series is not needed, as the game stands on its own narratively. The game’s core mystery is enthralling to unravel, and there’s almost too much else going on around the city to enjoy while you derail the plot. Crack out your case book, crack your knuckles and get going.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Judgment remastered is a fine return for 2019’s Yakuza spin-off. Though all of its changes are purely technical, it's the best version of this detective thriller. As a direct remaster, previous frustrations remain, such as the lengthy target tailing sequences and unnecessary drone crafting mechanics. But when you’ve got such an engaging story packed with content and a keen sense of style, Remastered is undeniably the best way to play Judgment.",,,,,,,,"An excursion into the Japanese universe, with charismatic characters, an elaborate story, emotions and humor. One also forgives the game for the fact that the hero is not a member of the yakuza this time.",,,"Judgment comes to the new generation of consoles with a facelift, with fluid combat, better graphics and animations and at a reduced price, which makes it one of the best adventures to enjoy the new generation.",,,"Judgment is a successful spinoff from the Yakuza series that simply demands a follow-up. If Yakuza: Like a Dragon is pulling the main series towards turn-based combat, then Judgment would be an excellent place to continue exploring its real-time brawler roots. If you’re looking for a next-gen title that will deliver much more than just pretty visuals, it’s well worth a purchase on the PS5! If, however, you already own the title on the PS4, your money is likely better spent on other games (You HAVE played Yakuza: Like a Dragon, right?)",,,,,,,,,,"Judgment on PS5 is easily the definitive way to experience one of Sega's best games and while there isn't much incentive for people who played it already to double dip, newcomers have a fantastic experience waiting for them with this remaster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stray,"Stray is most fun when you allow yourself to, well, stray from its narrative path.",,"Stray draws attention, stands out and it deserves just that. Annapurna Interactive's game is far from perfect, but the impression created here is that it will take a long time for such a unique proposal to be as well delivered as the kitten simulator. The game is perfect for those seeking a different experience without leaving behind clichés that are welcome in video games of the genre.","For all its high points - and they're well worth celebrating - Stray feels small but imperfectly formed. [Issue#375, p.102]","My main complaint with Stray is its length, it felt like the game could have done with an extra four or six hours if it were in the shape of more challenging chase sequences or harder puzzles. The lack of customization for the cat is another issue that has to be addressed. Early on, the cat acquires a jacket and it came as a surprise when credits rolled and there was never any opportunity to customize it, nor even the ability to add one (or more) of the badges that can be earned. There’s not even allowance for a change in the base color. Those issues aside, Stray is ultimately a double-A game that can be confused for triple-A if one takes into consideration the amount of polish, precision and quality crammed into it. Fur-midable indeed.","Stray is a good game, with a captivating universe. Beyond its pleasant artistic touch, its atmosphere is delicious, its gripping story and the characters that we will meet there are touching in a certain way. The gameplay mechanics are simple, we would have liked to go further on this aspect, but it works well and we take pleasure in embodying this cat, leading the investigation and going to the end of the adventure even if we would have appreciated its lasting a little longer.","Stray is not without fault, but it’s certainly good enough to be worth every second of your time and every penny of your money.",,"The world of Stray is truly immersive. It feels as if every little details has its purpose, and every part of the game has gone through a thoughtful process in order to provide the best experience for the players. Needless to say it is overloaded with cuteness even if you're not a cat person, and it surely makes your heart expand with its story and character relationships - even if they're silent. As far as indie games go, Stray is one of the best in its genre.","If you are allergic to cats, hate mystery, exploration and a good atmosphere in video games, don’t play Stray. Otherwise, you’ve probably already beaten it. It’s a rare occasion to get a title such as this. And if it looks like something you might enjoy, that’s likely because you most surely would.",,,"Stray has managed to meet the lofty expectations put upon it once it became known that you would take control of a lone cat within a dystopia punctuated by scores of neon lighting. While some may say that it’s hard to miss with a setup like that, what developer BlueTwelve Studio has managed to fashion from the composite parts is something truly special and has us yearning for more.",,,Stray writes a love letter to cats that serves as the wrapper for a delicious sci-fi bonbon filled with artistic nostalgia.,"It sounds ridiculous. And maybe it is. But the first ten minutes of Stray broke our heart. We’re a soft-boiled egg when it comes to animals, even when they're completely fictional. A cat who loses his friends and then gets hurt? Enough for an intense feeling of sadness and pity. It is not the challenge, but the experience that is key in this game. You really play Stray for the atmosphere. And that's exactly right.",,"Stray doesn’t just deliver on the promise of traversing a detailed cyberpunk city as a cat, it’s also an exciting and varied experience packed with memorable characters and rewarding exploration. While the story itself might not be super special, the city and its characters will stay with you for a long time.",,"BlueTwelve Studio was able to surprise us with a game that any type of player can try without problems, with intuitive gameplay that fans of independent productions will really like. The only problem is that in the end we are left wanting to have more adventures aside the little Kitty.","Stray didn’t want to tell an epic tale spanning oceans, it didn’t need towering bosses with glowing weak points to create the greatest tension. What it did do was weave a tale that the smallest creature can make the biggest difference and that despite our seat as the apex species, that perch is ever precarious, there’s always something ready to take the spot and life will continue. It’s certainly something that we need to be reminded of periodically.","It's true that some may be underwhelmed by how Stray handles its platforming and by how short it is, but these issues are easily overlooked because of the high quality found throughout the rest of the game. Stray is a genuinely unique gaming experience and is worth checking out for the cat alone. Stray looks great, plays great, and accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. It's a must-play, especially since it's available at a budget price and can be played in its entirety with a PS Plus Extra subscription.","Stray’s strength is delivering a fun gameplay experience in playing as one of the world’s most adored animals. While its story isn’t going to be attempting to say anything new about the world, it’s hard to pass up the opportunity to play as a cat.",,"Stray is a phenomenal, if compact, feline adventure that captures cats perfectly - even if they do find themselves in a bizarrely beautiful robotic world.","Anyone expecting Stray to be an action-packed stealth game – as the promotional material tried to argue it is - might be disappointed as the game is more about the journey and the narrative than it is about skulking. What Stray does well is expressing a journey featuring a less-than-common protagonist, and while other games have covered similar themes it’s that unique perspective, from much closer to ground level, and the visual stimulating scenes that makes it ground well worth padding over again.",Stray is a visually-stunning masterpiece of science fiction that seamlessly interweaves its features into a truly wonderful experience.,"Stray delivers much more than just a cat simulator. With its touching story and a message about humanity, the game teaches us to never lose hope even in the darkest time and enjoy every moment just like any cat would.","Stray is a masterclass in environmental design, with one of the most engrossingly detailed game worlds we've explored. Like its protagonist it's a little on the short side, but what's here will stay with you for a long time. Essential.",,"Stray is a melancholic game that tells a simple story about a cat lost in a world of robots pretending to be humans. The feeling of solitude is magnified by nostalgic music that captures the mood of the moment well and beautiful environments cloaked in twilight. I liked the cat’s perspective and enjoyed snooping around the underground city, but weird jump mechanics made exploring a bit harder than it should be.",,"Stray‘s expressive art direction, curious music, stop-and-snap-a-pic lighting, and thoughtful level design coalesce into one of my favorite gaming experiences of the year.","When you consider a game that lets you play as a cat, chances are you wouldn’t imagine that game then taking place in a cyberpunk city overrun with headcrabs where humanity has been eradicated and replaced with friendly robots. BlueTwelve has provided a gorgeous and unique setting to match its unique protagonist, and although its action and puzzle-solving may be too simple for some tastes, it excels where it matters — and what matters is making you feel like a cat.",Stray is a very cute adventure game where you can relax and engage in solving various puzzles using feline methods. It is worth mentioning that there is a couple of creepy moments in the game that can scare a child.,"Stray is both fun, clever and charming, thanks to its unique premise and colorful cast of characters. I only wish there was more to do, find and play with in the city.",,,"Cat lover or not, Stray is a wonderful adventure worth jumping into. You’ll quickly fall in love with your adorable four-legged protagonist, but it’s just a shame it’s all over so soon. We could have spent dozens more hours exploring the fascinating world experiencing life as a curious cat. As it is, Stray may be short, but it’s perfectly formed.","Stray is more than just a cat simulator; it's a love letter to cats and cat owners alike. It is an absolute spectacle from beginning to end, with a heart wrenching narrative and enough cat-centric puzzles to have you meowing for more.","We can all rest easy, then: Stray is stunning, creative, funny, and filled with moments that genuinely made my jaw drop. Whether you adore cats, or have some fundamental piece of your soul missing and don’t really care about them either way, this game is the real deal. It might be a little on the short side, but I was never anything less than utterly captivated and thoroughly entertained during the entire adventure. And really, what more could you want from a video game in these trying times?",Stray is a delightful adventure game that strips away all the normal complications of the genre to offer an enjoyable overall experience.,"This is a stunning-looking game, whether witnessed from the ground or the rooftops – I won’t spoil the cat’s journey, but the developer wrings copious novelty and some impressively creepy moments from this shut-off city in the seven-ish hours it takes to play through. It’s certainly far from twee, with the possible exception of the bucket-lifts that you can ride down from rooftops, paws and ears all poking out over the top – and those are so cute that they’re instantly forgivable.",,"Stray is an indie adventure that could be a Triple A game. It casts a cat as the main character, and focuses on exploration and puzzles,. Not only has a superfab technical production, it also has an entertaining gameplay and a touching message. The problem? When you finish it, it will leave you wanting more... and it's not very long.","Stray is much more than a jaunt with an adorable cat. It tells a story about social injustice in a form that is both clever and discreet. The gorgeous visuals and attention to detail make it easy to lose yourself in a distinct world. While the game lacks challenge, the pace and memorable set-pieces make this a tremendous trek with a tabby.","Stray is an adventure that will dazzle you if you love kittens. Its best virtue is the exploration, which truly makes us feel like real felines. The most action-focused parts are the least inspired. Even so, it's a meowly good game to spend a couple of afternoons playing.",,"Stray subverts our expectations by putting us through the unlikely point of view of a kitten with no fantastic powers or abilities on an exciting journey back to its home. With simple mechanics and impressive visuals, the game's great strength lies in the subtlety of a captivating narrative not because it humanizes the protagonist, but because it proposes to us, for a few hours, to really look at that world through the kitten's eyes.","Stray is a delightful adventure set in a dark but endearingly hopeful cyberpunk world for the simple fact that you play as an adorable cat at all times. Its combination of simple platforming and puzzle-solving with item hunting quests is beautifully balanced throughout this five-hour storyline, while its new ideas help keep things as fresh as a delicious fish.","By taking the best element of games such as Enslaved Odyssey To The West, Journey, or any of the plethora of cyberpunk games you can think of and mixing them all, BlueTwelve have crafted a truly unique masterpiece worth your time and then some. With a lovable story populated by a colorful environment and characters all tailored to bringing this world to life. A fantastic means of traversal that encourages exploration and a somber tone that kept me engaged throughout my 12-hour journey, never waning my curiosity, Stray is one experience I cannot recommend enough. BlueTwelve Studio -- welcome to the big time.",,"A delightful journey behind the whiskers of a fuzzy feline friend, Stray is a wonderful game for both cat enthusiast and indie enjoyer alike. The story, while simple, is enchanting with each new discovery – with some that may just make you shed a tear. Gameplay doesn’t break new ground, but feels unique from the perspective of a cat, which is handled purrfectly. Stray is incredible, and one you should be playing right meow.",,"Stray knows how to depict the life and movements of a cat like no other game. The robot city your kitty gets lost in is a joy to explore. Disappointing sections with mediocre gameplay, however, are a black mark in this beautiful cat coat.","The charm of its main character and a great world building elevate an experience that would otherwise be somewhat of a letdown. The narrative is really engaging and the artistic direction is top notch, but there's not much else to do in terms of mechanics and exploration. At the same time, if you love cats, this is could end up being a pretty special adventure (and it has a dedicated button to meow, of course).","Stray is a brisk and relentlessly charming adventure that offers a very unique window into a gorgeous sci-fi world. It won't challenge your mind or your reflexes too much but it'll absolutely delight your senses. Importantly, it's a video game with a dedicated 'meow' button, and what could possibly be better than that?",,Like no other game - despite small problems with the controls - stray lets us feel like a cat. And what more could you want?,Stray is a delightful adventure full of beautiful visuals and endearing characters. I thoroughly enjoyed my time exploring the post-apocalyptic city from the unique perspective of a feline who's dedicated to helping out the remaining robotic residents.,"Stray is one of the best games of the year so far. Surprisingly fun, it mixes a different and well built gameplay with a catchy storyline and a cute main character that will make you fall in love with it. It’s a great experience for everyone. You should check it out.",,,,"At its core, Stray is a beautiful game of exploration that can be finished at your own pace. Its gameplay constitutes a calming experience that makes typically mundane activities such as jumping on ledges, walking around corners, and even just meowing, feel powerful. Ultimately, the emotional connections you build throughout your adventure are a testament that you should never underestimate an unassuming cat as it could very well be destined for greatness.","Stray's gameplay is unique in a way because you now play with a cat, which makes for new perspectives and a fun experience. Along with an interesting story and gorgeous environments, it's optimal enjoyment. The fact that the game is barely challenging and a bit on the short side is a blemish. However, this does not mean that you should ignore the game, because Stray is definitely worth it.",,"Despite one or two rough edges, Stray is a very enjoyable adventure. It's fairly straightforward, and gives you lots of opportunity to embody a cat, whether that's rubbing up against a robot's legs, clawing at furniture, or finding cosy places in which to snooze. The narrative doesn't quite reach the emotional hit it's looking for, but it slowly shows its hand throughout, with plenty of interesting details to learn. Pairing a common pet with moody sci-fi has worked well, resulting in a unique, engaging game with strengths that outshine its flaws.",,"A charming adventure with a cat hero and a mysterious story. It’s a real joy to explore the dilapidated concrete city, even if the game is, at its core, quite simple. At least it doesn’t ever repeat itself, though.","Stray is a fairly entertaining game that sometimes weakens to slightly boring, and mainly relies on the huggability of its protagonist. If you are not a cat person, then GTFO and subtract twenty points from this figure.",A peculiar mix of cyberpunk dystopia and whimsical platformer that is just about held together by some excellent visuals and a very cute cat.,"Stray's main strengths lie in its adorable protagonist and its settings which are a joy to explore. Let's add to that a nicely conducted narrative and a mystical atmosphere draped with beautiful synthesized melodies. There are still the puzzles, which are often too basic and the frustration of not being able to jump where we want, which prevent the game from reaching its full potential. Stray is nonetheless a very nice experience, perfect for the youngest and quite touching for adults.","This is where Stray succeeds. It offers us delectable opportunities to act out the behaviour that so bewilders us, in very celebration of that bewilderment.","There isn’t anything like Stray. Sure, you’ve probably played puzzle-platformers set in dystopian cities before, but Stray’s cuddly protagonist gives this game an edge. It’s quirky, intuitive, expertly paced, and one of the most enjoyable games of 2022.","Despite the odd slip-up, Stray is a (mostly) relaxing game that takes clever cat interactions and turns them into a compelling adventure. The 8-10 hour story (on a completionist’s run) will certainly tug on the heartstrings in places but will not overstay its welcome. The gameplay is simple enough that it can be enjoyed by all ages although the younger children may find the Zurk imagery a bit scary. Those playing Stray on PlayStation Plus should definitely give this one a go, while those looking to buy the game on release should not have much hesitation.","If you go in purely to see the world in motion and walk through its immense cityscapes, you’ll be delighted by what’s on offer. But if you go in expecting a substantial gaming experience with plenty of input and deep engagement, you may end up disappointed. Falling somewhere in the middle, I can appreciate Stray’s overachieving presentation but wonder what could have been with this setting and this attention to detail had it not centered around a cat with limited room for gameplay systems.",,"Stray struggles to leave the high expectations this game has built up over the last 7 years behind. The feline adventure through the suburban jungle is enticing in a lot of ways, but stumbles occasionally with its uncanny-valley protagonist and a slightly generic story. The highlight is the atmosphere it can build as players jump between rooftops lead by neon signs towards the goal of climbing out into freedom. Stray is well-worth playing, but won’t blow anyone’s mind in the process.","Stray is a solid enough adventure game with archetypal mechanics and level design, elevated by its nice atmosphere and a unique perspective on the world.","Charming, Stray comes to remind us that a little well-crafted indie game is sometimes better than a big AAA game. Especially when the title in question offers us to embody a tomcat immersed in a universe that is both post-apocalyptic, cyberpunk and populated by friendly androids.","Stray's perilous journey about a cat and drone in a dark, desolate city provides more emotion than most human stories in media today. Who knew playing as a feline could be so much fun.","Stray makes the most of its choice of protagonist early on, really allowing you to do all the things a typical cat would do, though it eventually loses sight of that in favour of spotlighting the short story. That’s no cause for hissing, though it does leave the overall experience feeling somewhat like two kittens from different litters forced together. The combination works better than it should, but we’re ultimately left wondering what could’ve resulted if either half of the game had been given enough space to stand alone. [Issue#18, p.70]",Stray is a game with a unique personality. Captivating and endearing. [Recommended],"I can definitely see ways for an expansion pack or sequel to continue the story that Stray started, and its mechanics and puzzle-solving ingenuity both seem ripe for further exploration from a cat's point of view. In the meantime, this is a tremendous first effort from an entirely new game studio, and I'm confident in recommending it to anyone who's happy to trade conventional, been-there-done-that gaming adventures for something a little slower, shorter, sweeter, and more feline. [Ars Technica Approved]","It's by doing this - looking at the world through feline eyes - that Stray creates a journey filled with such a sense of exploration, on top of the chance to indulge in as much cat-truction as you like. While doing so, though, it also crafts a touching story about the human desires of those who, at a glance, lack humanity - be it to reunite with a loved one, protect a community or reach the outside world. The result is a wonderful mix: a game about the longing for freedom, clever climbing mechanics, and every cat’s eternal desire to knock items off shelves. [Eurogamer Recommended]",,"I went into Stray expecting a platformer about a cat. I did not expect a deeply profound meditation on what it means to be alive. Stray adroitly points out how blurry the line is between artificial and natural intelligence, and then runs with that thought experiment all the way to the horizon. Are humans defined by flesh and bones? Thoughts and feelings? The ability to use thumbs and solve problems? It’s gotta be love, right? Can a computer feel love? But wait, what is the human brain if not a series of electronic signals and computations firing away at all times?","It doesn’t try to make grand statements about mankind’s hubris or shortsighted innovation. Instead, it walks you through a living, breathing city where robots have molded their own society from the ashes of another, and lets players make of humanity’s self-destruction what they will. And that impression will stick with you long after the game ends.",,,"A great deal of care went into Stray, and the attention to detail and its beautifully crafted world make it a unique, worthwhile experience.","Stray is a good platform/puzzle adventure where discovering and exploring the world is fun, although it doesn’t do anything particularly original.","It's hard to perfectly encapsulate what Stray really sets out to do, as it is a jack of all trades, but unfortunately a master of none of them. Certain parts of this game are near masterclass, like its stealth sections, but it finds itself lost within its own identity too often, and misses the mark on more than one occasion.","Playing through the kitty cat adventure of Stray is an experience that's filled with joy and delight. I loved it, and so did my cat.","It’s safe to say that Stray wasn’t what I was expecting it to be, but that’s why I try to go into any game with as little advance knowledge as possible. Keeping an open mind to let this title be what it is and draw me into its world left me with a range of emotions by the end. I don’t know that I was expecting a game about a cat to make me cry for the reasons it happened, but I’m certainly not complaining. Anybody with an interest in cats, dystopian fiction, or questions about what makes something truly human, will feel right at home here.","Stray is a short and sweet game, with a unique and immersive adventure from a cat's point of view under a beautiful cyberpunk vision. The story of this lonely city and stray cats will linger on.",,BlueTwelve Studio's adventure game backs its unique premise with plenty of substance.,,"Stray is a small pearl, an adventure that delivers truly suggestive sequences and a fascinating story, which rests on the solid foundations of a very well written lore. Of course, just like a stray cat the game happens to get scared for every little jolt, so the team created a comfortable bubble giving up to fully express its potential.","Stray is a changing adventure in its playful and fascinating proposal thanks to its powerful artistic direction. As the credits roll, summing them up, perhaps the main limitations of the work are perceived: a story steeped in mystery, coherent and exciting with its own scenario, but perhaps not entirely capable of leaving its mark as it should in the finale.",,"Stray astounds with its beautiful graphics, quirky characters, and puzzles that bring out the best and worst in a cat.",,,,BlueTwelve definitely managed through its first title to implement in an excellent way the vision that was behind the main reason for the creation of the studio: To develop a game in which -although it suffers in terms of limited gameplay and easy riddles and puzzles- the player will feel like a cat.,,,"Stray might ultimately be indie in size, but it’s triple-A in quality, and while it may only last eight to 10 hours, it’s a game that has touched me for a lifetime. I can’t wait to see how Straybrings people together, because that’s exactly what it’s going to do. Now, go hug your cat for me, if you have one.","I ultimately did enjoy my time with Stray. I spent about eight hours total with the game--though the last hour and a half of that was backtracking for things I'd missed--and while I have a lot of questions about what exactly happened here, I am happy with the end result. The tale of Orange Catsidy and the world they lived in continued to unravel in my mind long after I'd found everything, piling up new questions that I hoped are explored in whatever future content BlueTwelve has planned. It's not going to unseat some of the bigger titles of the year, but as a fun and unique experience Stray is the cat's meow.","Stray is a delightful adventure in a dark but endearingly hopeful cyberpunk world, and that’s thanks in no small part to the fact that you are playing as an adorable cat the whole time. Its mix of simple platforming and puzzles with item-hunting quests is balanced very well across the roughly five-hour story – and though I wished my movement was a little more nimble during that time, I still loved hopping across rooftops and scampering through back alleys to find its well-hidden secrets. The new ideas it introduces along the way help keep things as fresh as a new bag of litter, too, even if not all of those ideas work quite as well as others. But whether I was scratching at a carpet or curling up into a ball and taking a catnap, Stray does a great job of setting itself apart in a way that feels like more than just a novelty.","Prepare your paws, claws, and meows, and embark through a post-apocalyptic robot world searching for your freedom, oh, and btw don't forget to destroy a couple of rugs, and some furniture and knock everything off the table.",,"A near purrfect throwback to a beloved gaming era, Stray tugs on heartstrings, whilst it also delivers an enjoyable playing experience lined with superb production value.",,"With Stray, BlueTwelve Studios and Annapurna Interactive have crafted a memorable experience that finishes just as it gets comfortable with its footing. But while it is short, it’s a testament to how the game looks, sounds and plays that it begs for more.",,"Stray is a wonderful exercise in organic worldbuilding with enough heart to hold its own against the best of this year. Despite having no people in it, Stray is one of the most human games I've played this year.",,"Stray does a great job at letting you act like a cat, turning a wide range of true-to-life feline behaviors into clever gameplay mechanics. But it’s much less successful at making you truly feel like a cat, as the game’s more conventional approach to its gameplay and story routinely shatters your immersion in odd ways. If you can suspend your disbelief and look past the missed opportunity of a more cohesive experience, however, there’s a lot to like in its moody cyberpunk world and varied challenges.","Charming, entertaining adventure game with a cat - attractive setting, strong graphics and the fresh hero make Stray more than just an insider tip.",,,"Stray is a true ode to both adventure games and cats. The game is expertly crafted with satisfying gameplay, a brilliant art style, and an even better story. A strong contender for indie game of the year, Stray will dig it’s claws into you from the very beginning and it wont let go.","Stray is a charming adventure that achieves satisfactorily its goals. With exception of some bugs, its problems are far from being factors that ruin the experience of the player. It's Certainly a very enjoyable and relaxing exploration game with a cool cast of characters and an engaging story. And yes, if you are a kitty fan you will fall in love with the protagonist.","Stray is not just a cat walking simulator, but a well-balanced adventure that turned out to be another winning bet for Annapurna Interactive. The merit of the success is to be attributed to Bluetwelve Studio, whose love for cats has allowed the French developers to create a very refined game in many respects. If you love cats and animals, don't miss Stray or you may regret it.","Unfortunately, the life span of Stray is limited to the number of lives the cats can have. Indeed, we finished the game at 100% in a little less than 9 hours. We estimate that 7 hours will be more than enough to finish the main plot of the game, or even 10 hours for players who will take their time to contemplate each painting offered by the game. In a way, Stray's rather affordable price is in line with its lifespan. The more skilled players may even take less time to finish the game, so it's quite a shame. Stray is a fabulous title that offers a refreshing environment, a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat and meticulous exploration that makes you want more, but our beautiful journey ends when we clearly want more.",,,,Stray is a game oozing with charm and can be considered a must-play for cat lovers looking for something new to pounce on and sink their teeth into.,"Stray is an average game, a fairy tale about a missing kitten who wants to return to the surface. The scripted parts are also its strongest and most effective narratively, while the open areas feel much less focused. All in all, Stray is a simple, enjoyable game. Great for those looking for a nice adventure and a bit of social criticism.",,,"Stray has charm to spare and a wonderful world well worth exploring. It would have been nice to have a bit more variety in your objectives and to have to spend a bit more time actually thinking about what to do, but it’s never less than fun to play.","Stray somehow manages to endear at the same time it feels like it's overstaying its welcome. At the end of the day, though, this cat-lover was won over by its sheer charm.",,,,"Stray will easily be remembered thanks to its weirdly captivating world filled to the brim with details and the charming quirkness of its inhabitants, although it does suffer from a relatively short playtime despite clever puzzles.","If it isn’t obvious at this point, cat parents and cat enthusiasts are going to fall in love with Stray. Yet its appeal scratches deep below the surface by weaving a powerful story about the struggles of humanity, wrapped up in an alluring dystopian world. Stray excels at delivering simple pleasures that all add up to leave you with an overwhelming sense of fulfillment.",,,"Stray is everything I wanted from it, an enjoyable and engaging journey across a well told tale that is every bit as cute as it is mysterious. More importantly, it made me feel empowered and brave in the face of uncertainty – I can’t remember the last time I’ve audibly cried out in delight so many times in the space of a few hours. Cuteness overload, no doubt.",,"There’s a touching, melancholy, and ultimately heart-warming story at the heart of Stray, one that plays into the immediately lovable (and somewhat timeless) nature of cats.","Where dogs are usually considered ""man's best friend,"" Stray suggests that cats may be robot's best friend. This is a game that wears its heart on its sleeve and expertly weaves its themes into everything the player does. There will likely be many people who buy this game because they want to play as a cat and their itch will be scratched, but there's also a high chance they will come away moved by its story of companionship and get caught up in its soothing and equally mesmerizing atmosphere.",,,,"It’s a shame that Stray feels so pared down from its warm, exploratory core. The trappings of what a top-shelf video game ‘should’ be only seem to siphon its joy. Stray is a beautiful game, and a fun cat simulator with some smart ideas, but one that misses its true potential thanks to an unnecessary helping of trope-ish design, and an unwillingness to ruminate on its most intriguing characters and themes. I wish Stray could have been more experimental and less linear, and I hope BlueTwelve gets the chance to expand this clearly ripe world in a more thoughtful direction.","Stray isn’t a furry gimmick that’s in it for the memes. Its cat-centric gameplay brings a fresh perspective to the adventure genre, putting an emphasis on curiosity-driven exploration. Some of its gameplay ideas feel limited and underutilized, but playful cat interactions make it a warm and fuzzy experience from start to finish. Come for its adorable furball hero, but stay for the socially conscious sci-fi story about how human beings are the architects of their own downfall.",,,"Your interest in Stray is going to come down to two factors, one very prosaic, and one pretty abstract. First: Do you currently have PlayStation Plus Premium? This is, after all, the first game since Sony revamped its subscription Plus program to attempt to do a Microsoft Game Pass-style “available at launch” thing, and at “no extra dollars,” it’s interesting enough, and brief enough, to be a more-or-less an instant recommendation. Second: Do you love cats? Love watching them move, jump, swat things off shelves, make a mess, be weird little guys, etc.? Because Stray is the best job anyone’s ever done at capturing those pleasures in video game form.","Stray lets you linger, but it also doesn’t overstay its welcome. I played through the entire thing in two sittings because I couldn’t put it down: I just had to know what happened next. When you mix that carefully plotted narrative with gameplay that lets you meow on command, you have an experience that scratches an itch I didn’t even know I had.",,,"Stray may be small and scrappy, but it’s also beautiful, lovingly crafted, and bounds from one genre and play style to the next with impressive grace. Even cat skeptics ought to be won over by the game, so don’t be afraid to invite this Stray in from the cold.",,,,,,,,,,,"For as charming of a game as ‘Stray’ is, it undercuts its thematic core by imagining a post-human future in decidedly human ways.",,,,,,,,,"It's simple: If you want to play as a cat, then Stray is the game for you. However, if you're more of a dog person, then skip it.",,,,,,,,"There are a lot of great ideas here, and what you go through in the adventure is just awesome. But without spoiling, Stray is really just about just the beautiful, intuitive experience of being a cat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
two-point-campus,,,,,,,"Two Point Campus is a decent follow up to the Hospital version, and it could have been a great hit if not for some minor gameplay shortcomings.","Polished and mechanically interesting, Two Point Campus does a really good job of making further education seem exciting. The charming presentation and relaxed tone makes the grind of management easier to swallow, even with pressures like money and student satisfaction. It's not perfect with AI pathing being a slight concern, but there's enough here to keep me engrossed. It's a very likeable effort with plenty of depth to discover.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Two Point Campus might not reinvent the wheel, but this is a game that knows exactly what it is and who its audience is – and it nails it. Two Point’s tried-and-tested formula works like magic in a university setting, and the freedom it gives to players to create the campus of their dreams is unrivalled. Its attempts at humour might sometimes fall flat, but it hardly matters when everything else is so good.",,,,,,"We loved Two Point Campus. It is a great game for veterans and newcomers to the tycoon genre, and has great sense of humor. Controls (with gamepad) need some practice.",,,,"Two Point Campus follows the successful formula of the studio's previous release, also offering a new and unique gaming experience. It could be the best business simulator for consoles to date.",,,,,,,,"Two Point Campus is another excellent entry from Two Point Studios that showcases not only more of the team's penchant for humorous and accessible management sim gameplay but genuine love for the genre. With a new spin that makes for a distinctly new-feeling gameplay loop and moment-to-moment decision making there's something here for both hardcore sim fans and casual onlookers. Some missed opportunities and controller-specific issues aside, there's never been a better time to create a ton of student debt.",,,Two Point Campus is certainly a substantial step up from Two Point Hospital as it's a much smoother experience and features some undeniably nifty new mechanics. It goes without saying but if you enjoy these kinds of games then it's a definite must-play.,"Two Point Campus is a good choice for those who like management and sim games, but it seems made for a very specific group of people. The courses and random activities are pretty fun, though, and the creativity to develop the game deserves a lot of praise.",,,,,"Two Point Campus builds on what Two Point Hospital brought us and that is a management sim that doesn't take itself too seriously. The controls on the PlayStation 5 are well integrated, were it not for the fact that the game does have a lot of input registration issues - which can be annoying. Also, the frame rate is not always top notch and for veterans, it's pretty easy. With that said, Two Point Campus manages to offer newcomers a perfect learning curve. The audiovisual style is fine and the gameplay is a lot of fun, which makes it quite worthwhile.",,"The lack of genuine stakes means that Two Point Campus never becomes truly gripping, but the easy, breezy vibe makes for an enjoyable, leisurely build-'em-up. It's the perfect management sim for newcomers or children or even fans of the genre who just want a palette cleanser between more challenging titles. It's the sort of game you play on a Sunday afternoon, still in your pyjamas, with one hand because you've got a Cornetto in the other. And we're totally okay with that.",,,,"A delightful, humour-infused, and very British university management simulator with Nintendo-esque levels of polish and depth that’s introduced so gently you barely notice it.","Two Point Campus makes an almost perfect copy by renewing the management game genre. Its amazing two-phase game system allows you to combine the best of both worlds: a game where you can build without stress and with ease, and a game where you can observe with pleasure the result of your work. If the phase of the school year turns out to be more idle than the summer holidays, it allows you to appreciate the excellent work on the atmosphere, the animations and the personalization of your campus. The game is funny and does not fall into the classic repetitiveness of the genre, thanks to its powerful construction tools and its scenarios that know how to renew themselves in terms of decor and gameplay. An example to follow.",,,,,,,,,,"Two Point Studios delivers for its second title, adding the perfect mix of challenge, humour, 8 and customisation to campus. A truly joyful experience at the University Of U. [Issue#18, p.82]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Two point Campus is an easy recommendation for anyone a fan of the management sim genre. Exceptional level of detail to design and a wonderous explosion of creativity within University Life. Like its predecessor Two Point Hospital, challenges will still be present throughout each individual campus, but these challenges are worth your time. Pick up your pencil case and your red plastic cups and enroll.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Two Point Campus is a delightful treat. Consistently funny, enormously satisfying, and challenging to boot, it'll take you right back to the best years of your life, or make the worst years of your life better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"To keep it simple, Two Point Campus delivers. It’s everything fans of Two Point Studios’ works would expect. An expertly crafted management simulation experience with the perfect amount of humor, wonderfully designed characters, and charming graphics, it is a game full of heart from start to finish.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lost-judgment,,,,,"Lost Judgment is a fantastic success. It expertly builds on the foundation laid by the first game while also continuing to differentiate itself from the Yakuza franchise in smart ways. It’s still very much a Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio Joint, but their brawling mechanics have never been sharper, their graphics have never been better, and this is one of the strongest stories they’ve ever produced. It’s a no-brainer purchase for fans, and new players will find it surprisingly accommodating.",,The Lost Judgment is one of the finest works by Ryu Ga Gotoku studio yet; a mature title that pulls itself out of Yakuza's shadow and represents an engaging and dark story combined with some solid Japaneese-Style action adventure gameplay.,,,"The gameplay and the combat of Lost Judgment are phenomenal, the story is amazing, and the side missions are, as always, an absolute blast. Despite all of the positives, the world is a little bit too overcrowded and looks like something we've already seen before from RGG.",,,"A fantastic action adventure that taps directly into the root DNA of the Yakuza franchise, Lost Judgment not only manages to simultaneously boast both the darkest and the goofiest storylines of any title in the series to date, but it also stuns the player with an absolute avalanche of hugely entertaining side quests and activities. More than that though, Lost Judgment also provides solace for those who found themselves turned off by the turn-based combat system that the mainline Yakuza series now seems to favour, while welcoming newcomers to one of the best new Japanese franchises of the last two decades.",,"Lost Judgment is a sequel that builds on the strengths of the original installment. If Judgement was to your liking, then Lost judgment is a game you must buy.",,"Lost Judgment is a combination of a thriller movie with a smoothly playing and well-furnished action-adventure game, where you will easily need twenty to forty hours to reach the end. So much for the good news. The game suffers from the same disease as many Japanese genre rivals: it wants to cram too much into one game. A little more focus would do the series good.",Lost Judgment does justice — never better said — to the original title.,"While Lost Judgment’s many systems might not look like much separately, together they succeed in creating a varied experience like no other. With the new setting of a Japanese high school and a story about bullying, the game depicts modern Japanese society in an exaggerated way similar to the Yakuza series while feeling fresh at the same time. However, shallow yet frequent battles and a story that starts to drag in the second half exhaust the player way more than necessary.",,,"RGG Studio’s greatest strength is it’s writing and characters and Lost Judgment delivers in spades. Characters are fleshed out and their motives feel grounded and believable, but you will also meet plenty of wacky and memorable folks as well. You grow attached to the people you meet in Ijincho and when bad things happen you genuinely hope everyone escapes unscathed.","Its detective elements may be lacking and its third act is slow, but it more than makes up for it, offering spectacle-heavy set pieces, an engrossing mystery, and a bounty of fantastic side missions. Whether a diehard fan of the Yakuza franchise or a newcomer looking to see what all the fuss is about, Lost Judgment is a thrilling adventure that shouldn't be missed.","Even if you do the minimum amount of side content and just stick with the main story as much as possible, you’re in for a long, interesting, and fun game. The story matter is heavy, though, and might tax some players into taking breaks more often than they might typically. To balance that, there is a lot of good humor and zaniness that you would expect from this studio, but also some endearing missions in the School Stories section where you do everything from lead a dance team, help engineer robots, box, join a motorcycle gang, and partake in a Virtua Fighter 5 tournament. Additionally, the changes that LJ has compared to the original are all positive, too — big new areas to explore, new gameplay elements in both the action and adventure portions of the experience, and yet the best parts of the original are carried over. Ultimately, this is an excellent game that I readily recommend.",,"Lost Judgment is more of the same, with better detective work, great side cases, and fast-flowing combat.","If you exclusively follow the main narrative then you’ll find that in Lost Judgment, Ryu Ga Gatoku Studio has delivered something every bit as compelling and interesting as anything Raymond Chandler ever wrote. The central crime story is a riveting and often uncomfortably poignant reflection on society (and Japan’s legal system). If, on the other hand, you’re more interested in more Yakuza-style zany side-styles and a deep collection of highly playable mini-games, the Lost Judgment has you covered there, too. I can’t see how anyone could fail to love this game.","Lost Judgment is nothing short of stunning. It's tightly-packed narrative never fails to enthrall, while its gameplay systems make navigating to each of its engrossing narrative beats an exciting experience in its own right.","Lost Judgment is a great addition to the Yakuza franchise. It's a Japanese action thriller with awesome narrative, interesting themes and wonderful locations. The game offers entertaining fighting and detective mechanics that are characteristic for the Sega series.","Lively combat and engrossing social clubs keep you busy, but it’s the much-improved detective story that elevates Lost Judgment above the original.",,"Lost Judgment is the sequel we needed. The story and combat are still the game’s strongest features, while the previously disappointing detective elements were improved. Some mistakes were made along the way (stealth sections, climbing), but overall it’s a great successor of Judgment. [12/2021, p.50]",,"Judgment may have been an acquired taste in many ways, but the sequel makes some of the bitterness go down easier.","This game’s biggest fault is that it has too much going on that detracts from the main plotline. I’m hoping Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio keeps taking risks with exploring gameplay outside of the Yakuza norm, and our next outing with Judgment (or another spinoff) will go further toward distinguishing itself as a unique property.","Lost Judgment is a big step forward, with many updates based on audience reception of the original title. Sega released a game that elevates the Judgment franchise to a whole new level.",,,,,,,,,,"Lost Judgment adds new mechanics and minigames to the Yakuza formula, although it is still a conservative approach. We loved the story, the characters and the realistic streets of Kamurocho in Tokyo and Ijincho in Yokohama.","Lost Judgment is a brilliant detective story that explores controversial subject matters to express a clear message about societal issues. Whilst there is a possibility that this could evoke some painful childhood memories, the considerate telling and satisfying conclusions to stories make them easier to digest. Although the game's structure closely follows the path paved by its predecessors, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has refined and developed its conventions to create one of their finest releases to date.",Lost Judgment is a perfect sequel. Its greatest virtue is a story that leaves us absorbed during the twenty hours that will take you to complete the main content.,"While Lost Judgement isn't a perfect sequel, it still lives up to its predecessor as it offers new refreshing gameplay mechanics alongside an engaging story.",,,,,"Lost Judgement is a small leap forward for the Yakuza spinoff series. While I would have expected a bit more from a sequel, what’s here is still just as enjoyable as the first game, if not more so. The highschool additions are a novel look at the often used Japanese setting, while still focusing on the crime drama and investigation fans love.","Lost Judgment can best be described as The Yakuza Game With The High School. It's familiar and comfortable, and it's likely to please fans of the franchise who weren't thrilled with the JRPG style of the last game. The storyline is sometimes too grim even for a Yakuza title, and it plays things a bit safe, but it's still a darn fun experience. If this really is the Judgment spin-off's last entry, then it's a fitting send-off to the sub-franchise.",,,"Lost Judgment rectifies a lot of the shortcomings of its predecessor while repeating a few of them. A compelling murder mystery coupled with intoxicating side content and sumptuous visuals make this another solid Ryu ga Gotoku title even if franchise fatigue threatens to take off some of that shine. It succeeds by expanding on what made Judgment great while offering the best real-time combat experience yet. Plus, you can skateboard and solve crimes with a Shiba Inu – I don't think I need to say much more than that.","An amazing murder mystery and conspiracy story is told through awesome gameplay in Lost Judgment. Smooth combat, amazing cities to explore and fun side quests will keep you coming back for more.",Lost Judgment challenges its predecessor. The Japanese drama nonetheless trips over an unfocused narrative and technical flaws.,"For a detective game, Lost Judgment presents an intriguingly complex story and a decent variety of gameplay and gadgets. However, it takes a long time to get interesting and the actual detective work is a bit too linear for hardcore mystery fans like me.",,,"Lost Judgment is more of the same with some fine tuning, but there are no revolutionary updates. There are more activities than ever, but the interface is the very same. There is a more fluid a spectacular combat system, but the AI is just the same. The analysis of the environment for clues still feels underdeveloped, and the tailing of people is still clunky, despite the new mechanics. If you liked the first episode, you’ll love this one, despite the high school drama. If you did not play Judgment you can start with the new game to see how well it suits your tastes, since it can be enjoyed without knowing past events. All in all, it is a good sequel to a promising franchise.","Lost Judgment takes what was good about Judgment and turns it into an even better game. The main story is riveting and all the side-stories are just as interesting in a wide variety of ways. The game shows a side of Japan that is rarely seen in video games. And it does it in a serious way that is even rarer. The silliness people have come to expect from a Yakuza game is off course here to add some levity. It is also hard to believe how much stuff the developers have managed to put in the game. There's all the side content seen in previous Yakuza games (except for the karaoke, which is sorely missed). And on top of that, they've added a handful of brand new activities and mini-games which all have their own mechanics. With Lost Judgment, the Takuya Kimura-led series already has its Yakuza 0.",,"The compelling story makes this sequel worthwhile in its own right, and what complements this is the fantastic and varied gameplay. With plenty of content, Lost Judgment is well equipped to keep you entertained for a long time, and last but not least, we must not fail to mention the audio, which is top notch. The Dragon Engine however does show its age a little, but that's fine.",,"A weaker overall story and some serious pacing issues prevent Lost Judgment from reaching the excellence of its predecessor, but this is still a fantastic character-driven detective drama. Crunching combat and a frankly ridiculous amount of impressively in-depth side content make this one of the most robust Yakuza-style offerings ever — and that's more than enough to outweigh the game's often obvious flaws.",,Lost Judgment isn’t some cheap knockoff. On the contrary - it really smartly expands on the story of Yagami the ex-lawyer and uses a beautiful Yokohama to its full potential. It’s full of action set-pieces and typical Japanese humour. The only downside? Its mechanics are a bit too familiar.,"One intriguing murder mystery, two Japanese cities, three great fighting styles, over a dozen addictive mini-games and countless side stories: that's Lost Judgment. Whether you're a Yakuza veteran or if this is your first RGG game, play it.","There’s so much reused content it barely feels like a new game at times but the storytelling in Lost Judgment is some of the best, and most thoughtful, the Yakuza series has ever known.","Lost Judgment is the legitimate sequel to Judgment, and does as well as its predecessor on most points. The faithful recreation of Tokyo and Yokohama is an invitation to exploration as the combat retains that franchise-specific intensity and technicality. As for the scenario, the latter literally takes the guts. The high school setting as well as the themes addressed perfectly compensate for the lack of a strong link with the Yakuza saga. Only certain gameplay mechanics that are too interventionist, and the noticeable absence of a new geographical area are to be deplored without this ruining the gaming experience.",,"While Yagami’s second outing is more sprawling and silly than its predecessor, it’s also proof that bigger isn’t always better.","Lost Judgment is a subtle improvement on the original, and continues the fun of seeing the seedy sides of Kamurocho and Ijincho while staying mostly on the good side of the law. A new combat style combined with a few more tricks up Yagami-san’s sleeves provide more entertaining ways to dispatch or get the upper hand on enemies, and of course the usual slate of minigames offer a much-needed respite from the main campaign’s twisted story. It may tread a lot of the same ground as the previous game, but that is absolutely a good thing.",,"Takayuki Yagami is a great character and Lost Judgment is bigger and slightly better than the previous game, but still not enough to become a definitive classic series like Yakuza.",,,,,"Fans will love another outing with Tak and the gang. Despite improved combat, worse stealth and stripped back exploration can overshadow it. [Issue#7, p.88]",His exploration of bullying from many angles and the fragility of the laws and the judicial system is an example of courage. [Recommended],,"RGG Studio's broadest, most packed open world is matched by mediocre additions and an ill-fitting story.",,,"Lost Judgment is the most captivating, dramatic and transfixing story of the year, and that should be no surprise to fans of RGG Studio’s output.",,"Those worried about where the tradition of Yakuza would stand following last year’s change in direction for the series should rest easy in just how well executed Lost Judgment truly is, from terrifically-written story to masterful gameplay.",,"Lost Judgment is a game that deals with incredibly important topics in a very serious way, while also staying true to the wacky nature of this and the Yakuza series. It is also a fantastic game with great combat and solid narrative, and anyone that is slightly interested in what it has to offer should give it a try.",,,"Lost Judgment is yet another home run for RGG Studio. It boasts an engaging, jaw-dropping narrative with emotional mysteries connected within an immense web of interconnected conspiracies. Additionally, the game's bold nature in tackling darker themes that can sharply resonate with young adult audiences is remarkably well done. Add on the expected and addicting side activities, minigames, and varied gameplay loop, and you have a sequel that manages to establish its own sturdy identity coupled with non-intrusive elements of the past.",Lost Judgment tells an exciting legal and political story while also giving players a return to the experience of their campus life. The great martial arts actions and the rich world design make this work a classic that is even better than its prequel.,,,"The slightly mixed quality is only a slight blight on Lost Judgment's otherwise stellar quality. It oozes style and has content that will keep players playing for potentially hundreds of hours. The story is a masterpiece of twists and turns, highlighting many issues within society. If the original game is the marker, this meets it with pride. An excellent crime thriller action game with lots of comedy and referential moments that make this one to remember.","Lost Judgment is an excellent sequel, capable of introducing several new features compared to the first episode of the series. Some do not hit the target, while stealth and platform sections often appear dull, but the third fighting style manages to add freshness.","Ultimately, Lost Judgment is a great sequel, characterized by very inspired writing and a great dose of irreverence. A braver second chapter, more refined and extremely more elegant, which offers the possibility of being played by all those who have never had direct contact with the first episode or with the Yakuza saga. RGG Studio proves once again to be one of the most competent teams on the square, capable of diversifying the gameplay as few, giving full importance to the narrative component of their productions and deliberately omitting some technical details that are however irrelevant for the success of the project. Sure, maybe more could have been done with regards to exploiting the features of Dualsense, but this is more of a wasted opportunity than a real lack.","Lost Judgment is too easy and doesn't reach the high levels of storytelling RGG Studio is famous for, but it's nonetheless a great crime action drama you may want to play.","Throughout my time with Lost Judgement, I felt torn about how I ultimately felt about the game. There were moments that I really enjoyed, especially the combat, but the handling of sexual assault and some unimaginative mechanics left me frustrated at best. All in all, I would say Lost Judgement is a perfectly okay sequel that fans of the original Judgement are sure to enjoy. It may not be amazing, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth playing. If you can handle the negatives, some genuinely great moments in Lost Judgment are worth experiencing.",,"In its culture-infused entirety, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s eastern feature has something for everybody scattered around every Japanese street corner and Lost Judgement is also a great example of what a “next-generation” title should look like.",,"With a story that tackles the subject of bullying with grit and realism, and gameplay improvements around the block, Lost Judgement surpasses its predecessor in almost every level. But the frustrating decision to lock the wonderfully written main side stories (school stories) behind an incessant amount of mini-games and backtracking is a black mark for the series that we sincerely hope we'll never ever see again.",,,,,,"Lost Judgment represents the unexpected return of detective/brawler Yagami and company in an even more exciting adventure that brings everything we loved in the previous instalments, and much more. Peak old-school Yakuza-like experience for those who love the more active approach to this genre.",,"Whether this is a first trip to Kamurocho or simply the latest of many, Lost Judgment is an engaging experience and hopefully not the last we see of Yagami Takayuki.","Much like the flashy combat, the story also builds itself with significant momentum. It makes Lost Judgment a game that, in addition to being fun to play, really entices you to see it to its end.",,,,"Lost Judgment is a hell of a game, mess and all. Passing its predecessor in some regards and lagging behind in others, it at least has solid bang for your buck and brings the franchise goods that have been built upon over recent years. However, I'm disappointed by some of the shortfalls. Female character treatment remains a problem in-game and the mystery or detective gameplay don't feel as solid as the one prior. Still, if you're after a living breathing world with plenty to do and some of the best combat the series has seen yet, then this is a mystery adventure that still manages to hit hard.",,,,,,,"A sequel overflowing with content, well-written and scripted, and with a varied, deep and satisfying combat system.","With this second episode, the Judgment series proves that it can perfectly complement the main Yakuza series, which has been turn-based since its seventh episode. Yagami's investigation in Seiryo High School is exciting and much better paced than the first episode, while the gameplay has been enriched enough to push us to comb all of Yokohama once again. However, street fights are still slow to start and some investigation sequences break the rhythm of the game on some occasions. However, if you want a dose of good humor with a dark and well-written detective story, you can go eyes closed.","When Lost Judgment stumbles, it never recovers. While there's a lot to love in the story and gameplay, at the end of the day, its issues become too much to ignore – especially when those issues are messy and irresponsible.",,,"This is still a Ryu Ga Gotoku production, meaning there’s an over-the-top and at times absurd line that weaves it way throughout the entire game. In short, Lost Judgment is a damn good time.","Lost Judgment is a high quality sequel. It’s fun to play, despite the few gameplay changes compared to its predecessor, and has a very engaging and well-acted story. There is never a moment of boredom when playing in the role of Takayuka Yagami, moving between Kamarucho and Yokohama in search of the truth, with a thousand doubts in mind, a thousand enemies to defeat and a thousand extra activities to try.",,,"Building upon its predecessor in every conceivable way, Lost Judgment is a superb sequel that tells a story that will leave you asking yourself what justice means to you. It's a gripping thrill ride full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the very end. And even after the credits roll, the city streets will call you back for more with their countless distractions.","If you want to accuse a town mascot of robbery, befriend a bunch of street cats or infiltrate a ninja dojo, Lost Judgment is for you.",,,,"Lost Judgment is a great follow up for the first title from Ryu ga Gotoku Studio, who takes everything that made the first game good and makes it better. Yagami and his friends will leave a lasting impression with this emotional story that shows the developer's strong writing and entertaining skills.","Over the years, Sega has kept up a brisk pace with Yakuza and its spinoffs, releasing games that share a lot of the same DNA. However, despite the similarities between them, Lost Judgment still manages to stand out and make a strong case for itself by tightening up a lot of the weaker aspects of the first game. It introduces fun and addictive side activities like the school stories and seamlessly immerses you into its world. It may seem easy to write it off as just another Yakuza-type game at first glance, but once you start to walk the streets with Yagami, you’ll want to see this case through to the end.",,"Sega is clearly capable of making a compelling mystery game that could stand in league with the work we see out of studios like Naughty Dog, but that will require a more focused, better-paced approach that Lost Judgement seems eager to avoid.",,"Lost Judgment improves on its predecessor by cutting down on some of the more tedious elements of its design rather than outright changing the mechanics to make the investigative side of the equation more engaging. In this sense, it's disappointing that it doesn't lean into what makes Judgment unique compared to the Yakuza series and instead remains at its best when sticking close to those origins. The story is compelling with an endearing cast of characters, the sheer amount of stuff to do is astounding, and there's still an inherent joy that comes from pummelling the city's delinquents into the ground. But it's hard not to feel disappointed that you still feel like a passenger when it breaks away from the Yakuza mould. If this is indeed our last time with Yagami and co., then it's one to cherish. There will just always be a nagging feeling that this was a missed opportunity to do something truly special.",,"As a whole, Lost Judgment is yet another strong outing for developer RGG Studio. Although this sequel is largely only a half step up compared to its predecessor, there's still so much to do in this world that can easily keep you entertained for hours on end. Even though I would have loved to see some more drastic improvements to many aspects of Lost Judgment, I still can't deny that I've had a great time in this second outing with Yagami, and I hope to see the series continue well into the future.","Lost Judgement is a step up from the original in almost every way with improved pacing, a more polished combat engine and a laundry list of fun side activities to get lost in. If not for the pedestrian detective elements, this could’ve been a new classic in the genre, and despite its notable flaws, it is still a story well worth experiencing.","Lost Judgment is a good follow-up to 2019's excellent Judgment. It's more of the same, but that doesn't matter too much when the core is already great.",,"Lost Judgment feels like the game Judgment was always meant to be, which is saying something given how well-received the original game was. With a bump in framerate and graphical capabilities, Ryu Ga Gotoku’s open-world stuns with its visuals and shocking story while delivering oodles of content for players to dig into. With its quality-of-life improvements and refined detective gameplay, It’s a no-brainer purchase if you enjoyed Judgment, but if you’re new to these games, it would also be a great place to start your Ryu Ga Gotoku journey.","Lost Judgment is a mechanically sound Yakuza spin-off, but its convoluted story makes it feel like a TV show that's gone on a few seasons too long.",,,,"You can look at Lost Judgment in two ways: an often clumsy attempt at serious storytelling, or a technically accomplished sequel that much improves on its predecessor. It’s both, really. The plot doesn’t fully land, and I found there to be more awkward moments than in Judgment or other Yakuza games. But I also can’t ignore the big leaps this game makes in other areas, and it still keeps up the irreverent charm of the series for much of its running time. Overall, I think this is a much better game than Judgment and I would like to see where it goes next.",,,"With its excellent detective story, extremely likable characters, and welcome improvements to combat and investigation mechanics, Lost Judgment won't disappoint any fan of the original, of the Yakuza series, or anyone looking for a very mature story. The game doesn't try to shake up the original formula, which may definitely put some players off, but this is hardly a problem when quality is as high as it is in the latest game from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.",,,,"The detective gameplay still needs some work, and the plot stumbles a bit from time to time, but I have never been happier to dive back into this world, nor sadder to leave it once the game is finished.",,,"If there was a category for most improved sequel this year, I strongly believe Lost Judgment might be in the running for winning it. The game offered so many new, cool things to do throughout my 45 hours with it and somehow striked a fine, delicate balance between the goofy Yakuza spin-off you know and love and a spectacular crime drama that tackles difficult themes not seen often enough in games.",,,,,,,"Lost Judgment is one of the best games in years with its superlative narrative, sublime combat, great soundtrack, plethora of side activities, and fantastic localization. This is easily one of Sega’s best.",,"I’m not going to be subtle here. I loved this game. I can never walk away from any game in this franchise unsatisfied, and I feel that even with my nitpicks and misgivings that this is a worthy successor to what many have seen as an interesting distraction to the main series. Lost Judgment stands upon the shoulders of its forebears with ease, is a joy to play, tells an intimate story with a (mostly) deft hand, and knows how to value add with the best in the series. This is not only a great sequel, it’s also a great addition in any gamer’s library. Period. Saying this is a must buy is an understatement. It’s a shining example of what a great Yakuza game can be.",,,,"Lost Judgment is another great entry in the Yakuza franchise, but one shadowed by better entries. The combat is incredible, the world still exciting and full of character, and the story is a worthwhile telling - but please, please don't make me tail anyone anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[Issue#378, p.104]",,"A Plague tale Requiem is not far from a masterpiece. The quality of writing, the mastered narration and the density of the characters, this intense relationship between Amicia and Hugo offer the game an incredible emotional dimension at the heart of a journey through a world as hard as it is beautiful.

But be wary of the framerate drops on the PlayStation 5 console, which bring their own set of unforeseen despair.",,,"A Plague Tale Innocence set the beautifully grim tone, and A Plague Tale Requiem goes beyond it and tells a captivating tale of hope and misery that builds on the original’s promise in almost every way. It may struggle to match its ambition in places, but Requiem is nothing short of a remarkable achievement.",,"A Plague Tale: Requiem improves upon the first game in almost every aspect; storytelling, characters, gameplay and content volume.

We wished that Asobo Studio took more risks when designing the gameplay, but the overall result is pretty good.",,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is everything that one could want from a sequel to A Plague Tale: Innocence. It's more ambitious and action-packed than Innocence, and is quite easily one of the best new game releases of the year. The fact that A Plague Tale: Requiem is a day one Xbox Game Pass game adds significant value to Microsoft's subscription service, and anyone with Game Pass should be sure to play it as soon as they can. Those on other platforms shouldn't miss out either, as A Plague Tale: Requiem is easily worth full price. Simply put, A Plague Tale: Requiem is a must-play game.",,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is relentless in its depiction of misery. It imparts the troubling message that no matter how hard we try, we can’t change the future, and trying to do so only invites more pain and suffering than willingly submitting to our eventual demise. A series about two children losing their innocence and being corrupted by the evils of the world is one I welcome, but not when it teaches us to give up instead of fighting for a future all our own. The world may seem hopeless right now, but if we give in to the despair we’re choosing doom, and I’d rather go down slinging.","A Plague Tale: Requiem doesn't drastically alter the foundation set by Innocence, but by iterating on its strengths as a character-driven fable within an oft-ignored historical setting, tells yet another tale to remember.",,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is a fantastic game, expanding its framework in the right places through intricate themes and horror elements, weaving into what worked about the original while maintaining a voice of its own.",,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is a sometimes compelling adventure weighed down by poor technical performance, and simple, frustrating and repetitive gameplay.","A Plague Tale: Requiem perfectly shows how a game is supposed to improve on its predecessor: the plot is much more intense, the characters feel much more alive and the gameplay is not only polished but also feels like a perfect evolution. This IP is certainly looking very promising.","A Plague Tale: Requiem tells an engaging story set in breathtaking sceneries of 14th-century France where enchanting flowery meadows contrast with battlefields reeking of corpses. For the most part, it’s a safe sequel, but some improvements to the formula gave the game a chance to win over those disappointed by the extreme linearity of its predecessor. Requiem offers open, sometimes very spacious environments with multiple paths and hiding spots, but it’s a shame that mediocre AI can’t keep up with more freedom and possibilities given to the player in terms of dealing with enemies.",,"Choosing not to reinvent the wheel in regards to its by-the-numbers stealth gameplay, A Plague Tale: Requiem instead goes above and beyond to present greatness in its overall package, delivering an enthralling story, magnetic characters, tense action setpieces, and stunning visuals that rank among the generations’ finest.

Its story, for example, manages to be even more engaging and touching, while numerous gameplay enhancements make it a deeper, more varied affair. It's just a shame that its first quarter isn't better paced, relying too much on you manipulating rats with light, and that its combat sections just aren't fun at all. Add in a myriad of performance issues and bugs, and you have a game that somewhat squanders its phenomenal potential, but is still very much worth playing.","Sequels are difficult to get right, but Asobo Studio has created a wonderful follow up to Amicia and Hugo’s journey. A Plague Tale: Requiem effortlessly expands on the premise of the original by fleshing out a more in-depth gameplay experience to cater to various playstyle while maintaining an engaging narrative filled with colorful yet unpredictable characters. The game is unfortunately only held back by performance issues and icky bugs.","It’s an amazing example of how a game can balance both the light and the dark; the majesty and the horror of the world in this time period. The path that lies ahead for these two children who suffer with the weight of the world on their shoulders should sound like a done deal, but you’re chewing your nails to stubs while worrying over the fate of their few friends and praying that there is a life for them yet. In this game, Hugo and Amicia have become unforgettable characters in the medium, and I hope that everyone has the chance to come on this journey with them.","Asobo Studios have delivered a runaway hit with A Plague Tale: Requiem. This is the very best kind of sequel: one that builds upon everything that came before and pays homage to its predecessor, while still carving its own path. Breathtaking.","Throughout its running-time, Requiem treads a fine line between poignant and absurd, balancing heartbreaking scenes in which Hugo wrestles with burdens no child should ever bear, with action sequences where you must flee from literal tsunamis of rats. But even at its most ridiculous, Requiem is always earnest in its ideas. Ultimately, it’s a game about living with incurable illness, the constant daily struggle, the threat of outside circumstances making it worse, the importance of hope, and the sad truth that, sometimes, there is none to be had.","The rats are coming, again! Requiem is bigger, bolder and more beautiful than its predecessor. The story is both huge and intimate, which is an accomplishment in its own. Requiem builds on what Innocence set out to do, and does everything better.","Requiem is a great sequel, bigger and better than the original game in every aspect (storyline, gameplay mechanics and technical aspects). It truly feels like a Triple A game, but it has lost that fresh feeling we had when we first played Innocence.","A Plague Tale: Requiem doesn't reinvent what made the first game great. Instead, it builds on what worked and makes everything better. From graphics and sound to combat, A Plague Tale: Requiem adds a layer of depth a polish we didn't even realize was missing the first time around. A lot of gamers missed A Plague Tale: Innocence, but everyone should play this altogether amazing sequel.",,,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is a fantastic game. The graphics are beautiful, the soundtrack is amazing, the gameplay is very good and the story is immersive and impactful. There are a few minor technical problems - which are far from ruining the experience - and, because it is a linear and plot-focused game, there's not much to do once you've finished the campaign.",,,,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is one of the most emotionally satisfying games I have ever played. I was stunned by the emotionally charged, beautifully presented, and impeccably acted story which is brought to life by incredible technical feats which showcase the power of the PS5. Time and again I was surprised by the sheer bleakness that the story was brave enough to dive into and the thrill of watching hope attempt - and often fail - to overcome those seemingly insurmountable odds. Requiem is a story which both uplifts and decimates your emotions at the same time; a story told by characters that feel real and that you grow to care and root for. By the end you too will be shouting, “I am Amicia de Rune and I kneel to no one.”",,,,"This long awaited follow up to Asobo Studio's cult hit doesn't come without grievances, but A Plague Tale: Requiem is a rock-solid adventure that's grim and gorgeous in equal measure.

Although it still has some technical difficulties, it's an amazing experience, with great storytelling and fun gameplay.",,,,,"A worthy sequel to the original that excels for its believable and interesting characters. Add impressive set pieces and music, and you have an adventure you will enjoy to the fullest. In addition, the voice-acting is also excellent and the gameplay varied enough that you won't get bored for a second. What is noticeable is that some somewhat classic gameplay elements are used in the game, when they are not necessary, making it feel somewhat out of place. There are also some graphical issues that need to be addressed, but none of this will hinder your enjoyment of the game.",,"At its best, A Plague Tale: Requiem is one of the greatest narrative-focused experiences on PS5 to date. Technical limitations get in the way some of the time, but with improved stealth and combat mechanics, this is a really well-rounded game that excels at nearly everything it does. Innocence demonstrated Asobo Studio's potential in bursts; Requiem has absolutely realised it.","A Plague Tale: Requiem is a reasonably worthy sequel to its predecessor. Its gameplay is quite varied and has fantastic graphics. In the aspect of history, it returns to us a harrowing medieval story that will not allow you to stay away from the game. It is certainly an experience that should be tried by many.","It’s a beautiful game but gameplay-wise, it sometimes struggles. The same applies to the story and especially the characters. Still, the game has its charms and is overall a solid addition to the series.",,"An action-packed journey through medieval France that alternates between visceral violence and rural beauty, although its puzzles and action sequences occasionally feeling undercooked compared to its well-drawn and believable characters.","A Plague Tale: Requiem is the game of confirmation. That of a sister's faith in her little brother when the world crumbles at the foot of their defeat. Then, that of the great talent of Asobo Studios. Offering richer gameplay without upsetting the formula, this sequel never forgets the essentials in relation to the genre it targets. Amicia's desperate fight is at least as magnificent as the graphics and soundtrack that drive the work. The infiltration mechanics can challenge, and we would have liked a final finishing coat, but none of the defects encountered tarnish our judgment: with Requiem, the Bordeaux studio delivers a great vintage. Dark red as death.",A Plague Tale: Requiem is a visually stunning and emotive fable that pierces through the noise of the most contested of release periods as a captivating triumph.,,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is a triumph of a sequel that ticks all the boxes fans will be expecting and then some.

It reminds us that others, today and in the past, feel or have felt our same confusion, fear and grief. In this, it makes an argument not for hiding the toll of so much pain away in the shadows, secreting bodies in dark passageways, but of bringing everything out into the light of day so we can try to hear what notes of hope sing through the darkness.",,"Terrific story and performances from its cast, smart progression, a compelling stealth-focused gameplay loop, an expanded palette in its visuals and a soundtrack that underscores the roller-coaster of emotion underpinning all of this.

The powerful, emotional heartaches that you will no doubt experience by the incredible cast of characters continue to impress after the credits roll.","A Plague Tale: Requiem gave me the chills. The graphics, sound design and writing are all phenomenal, and the gameplay is fantastic. There are a few issues with sneaking sections feeling samey, the puzzles being a little too easy, but these are forgivable for just how excellent Amicia and Hugo are as characters. If you enjoyed the first game, or you’re just looking for something narratively compelling, Requiem is the game for you.","A Plague Tale: Requiem is one of the must-play adventure games of 2022. It builds on what was lacking in narrative and gameplay elements of its predecessor and provides players with a heart-racing sprint of an experience. The low points of the pacing are merely used to catch your breath until the next encounter as you see Amicia's own innocence fade. Coincidental set pieces aside, there's a lot to love about this game, and I urge you to find out for yourself. However, this may not be for you if you have an uncontrollable fear of rats.","A Plague Tale: Requiem tells a thrilling and bizarre tale of a plague through bold performances and stunning scenes. But its lack of important gameplay such as combat and puzzle solving, the work has not reached a higher level in my mind.","A masterclass in narrative games design, A Plague Tale: Requiem is one of the most atmospheric and beautiful games you could ever wish to play. Amicia and Hugo's journey is powerful, evocative and downright disturbing and somehow manages to be greater than the original. Asobo Studio has crafted satisfying streamlined rat, light and stealth gameplay that perfectly serves the story it's trying to tell and only adds to the narrative intensity. A Game Of The Year contender for certain.","A Plague Tale: Requiem expands and improves upon its predecessor in nearly every way, delivering a meaty, excellently crafted, visually stunning, and thoroughly engaging experience.",,,,,A Plague Tale: Requiem brings back everything to love about the first game and builds an even more heartrending tale of the things people will do for love.,,,,"The main issue of A Plague Tale: Requiem is the absence of any real improvement to its already simplistic gameplay. Thankfully, its amazing set pieces, great visuals and -especially- its intense story of Amicia’s and Hugo’s survival make up for these gameplay shortcomings.",,,"Rats are often embodied by their desperation; as creatures that’d wear their own claws away by scratching desperately to survive, or eat through the hot, wet meat of a living person in the blind hope they’ll see freedom once again. Requiem feels like a game that isn’t just built around rats, but based on them. It asks: ‘what would it be like if the rat under the bowl had a conscience’? And its comment on the nature of humanity – and how similar we may or may not be to chattering, mindless vermin – will stay with me for years to come. Asobo should be proud of what it achieved in this game, as depressing and engrossing as it is.",,,"Although it represents a set of mechanics seen in many other games, A Plague Tale: Requiem as an extra predictable sequel perfects everything that was good in the previous game - with a few small innovations, and a drastically higher dose of rats and depression.",Quotation forthcoming.,,,"Both in scale and execution, A Plague Tale Requiem is an ambitious follow-up to Innocence that retools its core puzzle-and-stealth gameplay for a broader and more satisfying historical narrative adventure with fantasy elements. While puzzles are immediately intuitive and its action elements are much more rewarding, they rarely stretch the player’s brain enough to give much pause, making for a breezy, yet memorable adventure.","There's little else that can be said about A Plague Tale: Requiem other than it's everything fans could have hoped for. Though it may take a bit to find its footing narratively, the game is a phenomenal improvement over the first entry in the series while also being a fantastic experience in its own right.","A Plague Tale: Requiem serves up a sprawling adventure across a plague-ravaged, rat-infested France, though the simple tale and mechanics at its core can’t bear this sequel’s bloat.",,,"Graphically complex action-adventure with good characters, an atmospheric setting and a strong finale - playful in too many places but pale and despondent.","A Plague Tail: Requiem portrayed tragic narratives into a game full of immersion. Improved graphics and systems are smoothly combined with the characters' expressions. The story of tragic siblings over the two titles, have successfully concluded.",,,,,"The developers seem to have learned from the small mistakes of their first opus, especially on the gameplay. While the first title was considered too directional, this one is much less so, offering a much more aggressive approach. As for the scenario, it's a faultless one, the story faithfully follows the past events and transports the player as well in the terrible adventure of Hugo and Amicia. Still in France, the scenery will delight the friends of the little detail and will be able to be transported in the beauty offered by the south of our country. Will Amicia and Hugo finally find the peace they have been looking for? We strongly advise you to play the game to find the answer.","I was relieved when Requiem’s second set of credits rolled. Not because I didn’t enjoy playing the game, but because the de Runes’ journey in this game is tense and stressful for much of it. At times, it feels too long and oddly sadistic in its focus on inflicting fakeouts, pain, and suffering on the de Runes. Other times, I admired Asobo’s command of this series, its rat-infested stealth mechanics, and its grandiose storytelling. Fortunately, the latter edges out the former, and Requiem feels like much more than just a follow-up. With this journey behind me, I’m excited about where the series might go from here, but if Asobo plans a break for the franchise, rest assured that Requiem goes out with an impressive bang.",,,A Plague Tale: Requiem finishes the brutal and often forlorn story of the De Rune children in a sequel that feels imperative to fans of the original but adds little to those not convinced by Asobo Studio's first entry into the series.,"Slightly better than Innocence in terms of storytelling, gameplay and world building, A Plague Tale: Requiem still needs some tuning on the technical side.",,,,"Requiem has refined and improved the formula that made the first game so intriguing.

I’m a 28-year-old who grew up watching and loving the prequels and was obsessed with the original Lego games. I came into this review thinking it was something that was going to blow my mind and change Lego games forever; when it’s a game that’s sole intent is to give the younger generation something to love. Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a great game in the right circumstances, and I still loved my time reliving some of my favorite Star Wars moments through a Lego lens. It also gave me an appreciation for the past that I wasn’t expecting.","There aren’t many games I’ve been bursting to play. Skywalker Saga was a rare case, but that came with an added risk - not living up to the hype. It’s the first Lego Star Wars to bundle the films together since the Complete Saga and that’s a tall order, especially since it’s now nine films. Not just three trilogies, either, but all their worlds, their cities, and their landmarks. The old games had small hubs with Dexter’s Diner and Mos Eisley’s Cantina, but Skywalker Saga goes above and beyond to bring Star Wars’ galaxy to life. It lived up to the hype and shattered my expectations. Somehow, Lego Star Wars returned, and it returned with style.","A breathtakingly expansive and authentic recreation of the core Star Wars universe in LEGO.

At last, THIS is the droid you are looking for.",,,"Skywalker saga is a blocky nostalgic masterpiece that not only outbuilt every Lego game ever but perfected the established formula.

It's certainly a huge improvement in terms of visuals; this really is a gorgeous-looking game on PS5. A few bugs may let it down somewhat, but they're easy to forgive and forget.

It’s not doing anything radically new with the recipe, but it doesn’t really need to – this is a game about nostalgia, not just for Star Wars but for the Lego games themselves. These games have always sought to conjure our favourite family movie franchises as we choose to remember them, shorn of all the boring, indulgent and problematic bits.

For this feat alone, the game deserves the attention of fans and families throughout the galaxy.","TT Games has outdone itself by reinventing the LEGO formula to create the most complete Star Wars game in history. The mechanics have been reworked to suit both young and old players, while keeping that great LEGO humor throughout. As Ben Kenobi would say: ""This is the Star Wars game people are looking for!""","LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is like a dream come true: a game where we can play the most important moments of the nine films, engage in lightsaber battles, fly and fight with a space ship, explore the galaxy, control ALL the characters... If you are a Star Wars fan, it's a must have.",,"LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a dream pack made with immense affection, which knows how to please fans of the movie saga, and also how to enter through the eye of the smallest. As the videogames based on these toys have been doing for almost two decades. For all these reasons it is, without a doubt, the best LEGO videogame to date. You will like it even if Star Wars is not your thing.","Ultimately, if you like the Lego series of games then there’s a high probability that you will like this… if you also like the Star Wars films (even just some of them) then this should be high on your list of items to purchase. It’s certainly a cheaper way to enjoy a bunch of Lego sets with the ability to play through your favourite parts of the Star Wars films.","Although it brings many of the elements that are so characteristic of other games based on the famous building blocks, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga offers good refinements in its mechanics, is visually spectacular and condenses well, even with some haste, the story of the nine main films of the movie franchise with a lot of charm and good humor.",,,"The Skywalker Saga is exactly what we expected it to be - a fun LEGO version of our favorite movies with dozens of hours of solving puzzles, climbing stuff and destroying everything in our path. A perfect game for kids, or to unwind after a hard day.",,,,"Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga can cause some frustrations with its inexplicable design decisions and it is not a ""breakthrough"" title in the franchise as it was expected. However, it can’t be denied that’s extremely fun to play.","When the twin suns set on my time with LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga, it was obvious to me that this production is lavished with love and worth every stud of its asking price. I've been around the block(s) with TT's games for some 15 years now, and this is without a doubt the best thing they've ever snapped together. If you're a gamer who’s young or young-at-heart-container, I'd be very surprised if this didn’t instantly click with you.",,Familiar looking Lego adventure that scores with its large scope and great attention to detail.,"After a few years of being in development, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga was definitely worth the wait as it single-handedly revitalizes the LEGO formula for a modern audience. I can't wait to see what other licenses will get this treatment down the road.","LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a hit for both Star Wars and LEGO fans. It mixes the amazing universe that George Lucas developed for movies/TV with fun and games that are a trademark of the video game franchise. The storyline is really funny, gameplay is pretty friendly and you will probably love it if you enjoy Jedi stuff.",,,,,"A comprehensive title that again offers a huge amount to collect thanks to the hefty amount of content. The LEGO gameplay also remains fun to experience so in that context you know exactly what to expect. But the game - despite years of development - lacks truly innovative steps forward, making it feel like more of the same. Also, the pace is not always consistent, which feels a bit weird in the experience. Nonetheless, an entertaining adventure that is well worth the effort.",,"LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a meaningful step forward, smartly evolving the gameplay without losing that fun-loving core. Kids will love the slapstick humour and colourful sights and sounds, grown-ups will appreciate all the elbow-in-ribs jokes, and both will enjoy just how much there is to do. Despite some very minor issues, it's gram for gram the best LEGO game in a long time, and it's up there with the top Star Wars games to boot.","Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga delivers and fulfills all of its promises. It's a great way to revisit the universe created by George Lucas with hours of content and fun. Despite some technical problems, you will enjoy this game from the very first joke to the last.","Bigger, prettier and filled with content to the brim, but also very simple and limited in what you can actually do - that is the new Skywalker Saga. If you love your Lego and a bit of accessible fun, this is just the game for you.",,"A wonderfully enthusiastic love letter to Lego, Star Wars, and video games in general, that goes above and beyond the call of duty in terms of the scale of the adventure, the attention to detail, and the sheer volume of content.","LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is an experience that is both very family-friendly and accessible. Two boxes ticked brilliantly. The game is beautiful, generous, offers great sensations and can easily please all ages despite its few game design flaws. TT Games undoubtedly offers the ultimate LEGO Star Wars experience for all fans of the series as well as an ideal entry for the youngest into galactic adventures.",,,"LEGO Stars Wars: The Skywalker Saga does a great job of giving everyone the LEGO world they love, with some nice tweaks to the formula that’s been in place for a while. It’s not a perfect game of course, with some camera and AI issues, along with signature TT Games glitches that plague parts of the game. However it’s still a good game and one of the best LEGO games to date. Perfect for kids and adults alike, there is something here for everyone and enough to keep you around for a while, especially if you want to collect everything. LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a great first build on the PlayStation 5.","LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker saga is a graphically beautiful, sprawling sandbox game that blends humor together with more serious moments of the saga's lore, all while providing a dizzying amount of content to chew through. The game may not reinvent the wheel, but every gameplay feature from platforming to collectibles, classes and the open-world style of play is done masterfully. Without a doubt, this is a franchise-defining game for LEGO video games, and I personally cannot wait to see what the developers do next.","The biggest LEGO game ever made and certainly one of the best. A galaxy (far far away) of levels, challenges, characters and secrets... but still no online co-op.",,,"After 17 years working on the LEGO + Star Wars combo, the developers at TT Games have clearly mastered their subject. The Skywalker Saga is unquestionably their greatest achievement in this area, whether in terms of quantity or quality.",,"Frustratingly failing to hit (but only just) the heights it could’ve reached, this is a great reason to fall in love with Lego Star Wars all over again.

An adventure full of nostalgia and fun, I love the LEGO humour. [Recommended].",,,,,"You’re able to explore every world from the Star Wars universe, but in that expansiveness, sometimes searching for largely meaningless in-game items and completing fetch quests, the greatest revelation is a question: Was this ambitious vision for “The Skywalker Saga” worth its cost?",,"LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a triumphant reinvention of the LEGO series, successfully adapting the entirety of the mainline Star Wars films, building out a galaxy filled with activities to pursue and reinventing gameplay mechanics for a new generation.",,,Don't let the LEGO license fool you.

TT Games have been at this one for a long, long time and now we absolutely know why. They’ve made perhaps the most complete, expansive and nerf-herdin’ entertaining Star Wars game there’s ever been. Didn’t think they could pull this off? I find your lack of faith disturbing.",,,,"The close-up view, the more in-depth combat system and the renewed aiming system bring the title closer to the trappings of an action adventure with a vague role-playing component.",,,,,,,"Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a triumph and everything fans hoped it would be. For Star Wars fanatics, the love of the source material can be found in the game’s countless details, and it’s hard to imagine a more polished Lego title than this. Even if you’re a complete novice to the world of Lego Star Wars, the game is so much fun as a co-op adventure that you’ll soon come to love it. Not since It Takes Two have I enjoyed spending so much time in a digital world.","The proof of concept is approved, as it serves on an emotional connection that we have with a galaxy far far away, it's a cheap shot, but it reaffirms a so long asked modernization of all TT Games' titles by the fans that we can only guess will be honed on the years to come. LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is in that fashion a fun charm trap that holds on to us thanks to the constant changes in gameplay, snowy AT-AT encounters, and spectacular lightsaber battles where the dramatic flare is replaced by the adorable and unpredictable reactions of the main figures of the saga.","Really, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is all the action from the Star Wars series, swaddled in the slapstick silliness LEGO has become known for in entertainment. While it’s not a 1-to-1 retelling and your favourite moment might have been left in the toy chest, it’s a knowing showcase of Star Wars’ place in pop culture – memes and all – in a deep, but accessible package.",,,"The complete Skywalker Saga in LEGO form is the biggest LEGO game so far, although some new systems may not be implemented the best, this is still one giant entertainment package in which every Star Wars fan will be able to invest hundreds of hours.","All in all, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga has sadly been a frustrating experience for me. World design and presentation, with John William's classic score and the beautiful graphics, are top notch, but the gameplay and quest design got redundant only after few hours.",,,"For longtime fans of Lego Star Wars, there’s enough of an improvement to the tried and tested formula to warrant some intrigue, if only to see how far the series has come along.","While LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is more of an evolution of the franchise than a full on revolution, it’s still quite possibly the definitive Star Wars video game collection right now, not only from a content perspective, but from an authenticity and a fun factor perspective as well. Equally charming as it is nostalgic, it’s a wonderful experience, especially for those with a soft spot for that galaxy far, far away.","Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is the perfect Lego game, the perfect Star Wars game, and a fantastic sendoff to an illustrious series as a whole.","LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is what all of the LEGO games have been building towards, if you’ll pardon the expression. With its huge open world with side quests, puzzles and secrets galore, it's a great adventure game for players of all ages. If you’re a Star Wars fan, then the nostalgia trip and mountains of obscure characters and references they manage to sneak in there is a real treat. While the unimaginative script and missing character creator does hold it back somewhat compared to previous entries, from a gameplay and content standpoint, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is the most ambitious LEGO game yet, and a must-have for Star Wars or LEGO fans out there.",,,,,,,"The biggest LEGO videogame ever made dips the players in a cohesive Star Wars experience. In terms of gameplay, innovations are not to be expected, as the LEGO formula is well established and it's still working. LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is easy to pick, fun to play alone or along with a friend/kid and a mandatory experience for any Star Wars and LEGO fan.","What makes a good LEGO game? A good dose of humor, varied levels, brick collecting and flawless local co-op. Obviously, this Skywalker Saga meets all these criteria with flying colors and more. Of course, we enjoyed the return of some of the typical TT Games foundations, but it was the novelty and the risk-taking that attracted us. Stunning graphics for a game with bricks, more dynamic fights than ever and a huge open world full of secrets and puzzles. In short, an ambitious compilation confirming that this is the best LEGO game of all time. Can't wait to see what's next with other adaptations.",,,,"With a dash more depth to its gameplay, and a lighter touch to its narrative, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga reinterprets the nine-film epic into a solid experience that all generations of fans will want to revisit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Improvements on the already entertaining LEGO formula such as a tighter perspective and reworked combat systems make The Skywalker Saga's retelling of the nine mainline Star Wars films a blast for fans of all ages.,,,,,,,"As a big playpen for Star Wars fans, The Skywalker Saga hits all the right notes thanks to its hilarious writing, audio-visual wonder and oodles of content to explore. However, its poor implementation of co-op and unnecessary complexity but you can quite comfortably look past these problems (which in some cases can be patched) in favour of its moreish open-world. This isn’t the Lego Star Wars remake you may have been looking for, but it’s the one we’ve got, for better and for worse.",,,,,,,,"Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga sets its sights sky-high and largely does justice to that galaxy far, far away. Its truncated treatment of the movies occasionally disappoints, but charming, content-packed sandbox stages mostly make up for any story mission shortcomings. This blocky take on George Lucas’ family drama is worth enjoying with yours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I didn't dive into LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga expecting to have a lot of fun, but that's exactly what I had: a lot of fun. The witty writing is well timed and expertly delivered, reliving the events of the Star Wars franchise was a welcomed nostalgia trip. Even after completing the game, I woke up excited to dive in and explore more worlds, solve more puzzles, and unlock more characters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ys-viii-lacrimosa-of-dana,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There's no question that Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is a beloved entry in the franchise. However, bringing it to the PS5 offers next to nothing to the entire experience, bringing only the most miniscule of adjustments, another Trophy list, and a free PS5 upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana was a great game in 2016 an it still is in 2022, but the lack of improvements or noticeable additions make this PS5 version a bit questionable.",,,,"If you've never had the chance to play any game from the Ys series, it's time to give yourself a chance to do this. With many hours of duration, fun gameplay and dynamism thanks to its excellent performance, Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana easily becomes one of the best action RPGs on the console.",,,,"Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of DANA is a wonderful game, but this PS5 upgrade doesn’t do much to justify its existence. You get the DLC and an obtuse 120 fps mode, sure, but you’re basically still getting the exact same experience as if you played the PS4 version on a PS5 or Pro. The game itself is highly recommended, but console upgrades should have more features and this feels like less than the bare minimum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ys VIII is still great, then, and although it's not worth shouting about, the experience is enhanced on PS5. A slight resolution boost, better shadows, and a much improved draw distance gives the game's somewhat aged visuals an edge.

[Recommended],,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’ve never played this defining entry of the franchise, the PlayStation 5 port is the best way to do so. Alternatively, if you’re a veteran fan or achievement hunter, this release has a separate trophy list, allowing for another Platinum if that’s your jam. Ys IX is also scheduled to receive a native PlayStation 5 version next year, and while the improvements probably won’t be as substantial as with VIII, I hope it turns out as well as what’s happened here.",,,,,Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana on PlayStation 5 is basically the very same game it was on PlayStation 4 and Switch with the added benefits of a very smooth frame rate and some visual enhancements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of DANA for PS5 is a good way to get into the franchise, even if we haven't played a previous game in the series. It is a game with a charming story, memorable characters and quite long. Its gameplay is fun, strategic and seamless. Graphically superior but with those old-fashioned textures.",,,,,,,,,,,,There’s little incentive for fans that already have a copy of another version to purchase the PlayStation 5 port again. But this is an absolute must-play for anyone seeking an adventure. It’s wonderful to see so many players across different platforms being able to enjoy Nihon Falcom’s magnum opus.,,,,,"A masterpiece to be done at least once in a life time thanks to a rocking universe, a magic soundtrack and a dynamic gameplay.",,,,"Ys VIII remains a fundamentally great action JRPG that looks its best on PS5, but its underwhelming DualSense feedback is a huge missed opportunity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of DANA remains one of Falcom's best games, and the new PS5 version is a great entry point into the series thanks to its enhancements. If you already own the PS4 version, it isn't worth grabbing, but this is the best console version of Ys VIII, and the low asking price makes it an easy recommendation for newcomers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this-war-of-mine-final-cut,,,,,,,"Even 8 years after its initial release, This War of Mine is still a worthy survival game that shows us how cruel wars can be, and considering what is going on in the world right now, there can't be a better time to play it.",This War of Mine: Final Cut offers more content than previous versions and creates some powerful narratives. Runs tend to play out in a similar fashion despite the variables on offer but it's certainly worth experiencing.,,,,,"An enduringly clever inversion of traditional survival genre tropes coupled with a palpably tragic and gut-wrenching experience, This War of Mine: Final Cut offers up 11 bit studios magnum opus in its perfect form. By packing in all of the DLC released to date in addition to the stellar Stories expansions and providing a pin-sharp 4K presentation, This War of Mine: Final Cut is an ageless, horrifying and inventive survival effort that everybody should play without delay. This is as essential as survival games get and its mediation on the desperate plight of civilians during a time of war has never been more resonant.",,,,,,,,,,"Despite some minor technical flaws, This War of Mine remains a poignant and, unfortunately, relevant game to this day. It is no surprise that it was the first video game in history to be added to a school curriculum. Its depiction of the harsh reality of war for civilians makes it one of the most unique games to come out of the previous decade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This War of Mine: Final Cut brings the most complete edition to current-gen consoles. While the game feels slow and a little aimless at times, it makes up for it with moments of real tension, drama and difficult decisions. Its aesthetics and overall mechanics have aged well, and thematically it’s more timely than ever. It can be a pretty bleak game, but it was, and remains, worth playing. This War of Mine Final Cut looks better than ever and feels perfectly at home in this version.",,,"This War of Mine: Final Cut is a great provocation for each of us regarding the effects and feelings that result from extreme situations such as a state of armed conflict. Technical improvements and supplemental content add to the base material, and even with some troubles in the gameplay, it remains impactful and, perhaps, even more necessary than ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a beautifully crafted cautionary tale about the horrors of war and the true devastation it can rain on ordinary civilians. Like real war, every story you play will be different with different outcomes, and you’ll be led to make increasingly more desperate and erratic choices to ensure the survival of your characters.",,,,,"By offering a realistic look at war by positioning yourself at the head of a group of civilians trying to survive, This War of Mine offers a different approach to survival games but does not avoid some pitfalls. Admittedly, the game mechanics are always the same and can quickly tire you. In addition, certain aesthetic choices somewhat taint the visibility of the infiltration phases and the writing is sometimes clumsy. But it would be criminal not to salute a game which manages to convey a strong message, which knows how to place the player in front of his own conscience at all times without falling into voyeurism or bad taste. A devilishly interesting experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This War of Mine: Final Cut closes an important path for 11 bit studios and does so at the most appropriate time, when it's really important to raise awareness of what war really means for ordinary people. From this point of view, the game still does its job very well and the three extra stories add further narrative depth to the package, which however remains designed for mouse and therefore turns out to be rather cumbersome when playing with a controller.","An experience whose moral value probably exceeds the playful one, and whose didactic value manifests itself spontaneously and apparently unconsciously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This War of Mine: Final Cut is not the survival game that we know. It is a game that teaches the brutal part of wars, history and its mechanics. As a console edition it is impressive with additional graphics work and new stories; the controls can be a little tricky, though it is highly enjoyable.",,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s impossible not to think about what real people in different parts of the world are going through right now when playing This War of Mine in 2022. That’s part of the point. Buying a video game perhaps isn’t the best way to support those people, but This War of Mine: Final Cut captures the true horror of war in a way that few video games will even try, let alone succeed, and for that, it’s an absolute must-play. If you’re like me and waited nearly eight years to check This War of Mine out, it’s time to fix that mistake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wrc-9-fia-world-rally-championship,,,,,,,,"WRC9 is a great example of a crossplatform port. Kylotonn should be applauded for their sterling efforts here, especially with regard to using Dualsense. Yes, rallying might not be for all, but this is a fine driving game which utilises the WRC licence to great effect.",,,,,"Though the breadth of the upgrades that the PS5 brings to WRC 9 is expected and somewhat unambitious to an extent, the truth is that developer Kylotonn has provided a delectable coat of polish to what is already considered to be one of the finest rally games in years. If you've got a PS5 and you want a rally racing sim to cut your teeth on, they don't come any better than WRC 9.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WRC 9 on PS5 adds a new layer to the gameplay thanks to the haptic feedback, with improved visuals that're noticeable from the start.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While it’s perhaps not the graphical powerhouse we would use to showcase our new console to friends and family, WRC 9 on PlayStation 5 runs at a consistently smooth 60 frames-per-second at 4K resolution, and marks a significant improvement over its last-gen underling. However, it’s the game’s use of the haptic feedback technology provided by DualSense that really takes centre stage here, potentially offering a transformative experience for players who choose to play with a controller.",,,,,"Unsurprisingly, this next-gen version of WRC 9 perfectly exploits the possibilities of the SSD with very short loading times and active functions allowing you to go faster to game modes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Of all of the PS4 games that have had PS5 upgrades, WRC 9 shows the most improvement. Sharper visuals in 4K running at a consistent 60 FPS transform an average looking game into a gorgeous one. Combined with an unchanged driving system that needed no tweaking and excellent DualSense implementation that elevates it, this takes 1st place as the best racing game on PS5 so far.",,"A fantastic rally sim for newcomers and veterans alike, WRC 9 has only gotten better in its transition to the PlayStation 5. The next-gen console brings with it obvious visual and performance enhancements - pushing gameplay anywhere between 60 & 120 fps - but the real star here is haptic feedback. WRC 9 use of the DualSense controller is outstanding, utilizing sensations and vibrations to add another layer of immersion to racing. Players will feel the road underneath them, the weight of their brakes, and the subtlest shifts in terrain. A mix of addictive arcade gameplay and deeply immersive feedback, WRC 9 exceeds expectations.","The same good rally game, with a surprising use of the Dualsense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An impressive PS5 upgrade that makes excellent use of the DualSense.

But if you missed before, then it's absolutely worth getting lost in.",,,,"Overall, Roki was a big win in my book. Initially, I found its family-friendly focus to be a detriment to my enjoyment in my first sitting with it. In my second, I began to appreciate more of what it was going for, and in my third sitting, I played for 5 hours without even realizing it. Roki has a lot going for it, including a unique story, well-done but straightforward mechanics, and a simply beautiful art style. Don’t let this one slip past you like a tomte hiding in his hat.",,Röki is an easy recommend and goes some way towards exemplifying why indie games still hold an important place in the industry amongst the big-budget blockbusters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With a compact, but dense world to navigate – most of the game takes place in one sprawling interconnected area – you’ll learn your way around in no time. This is aided by the game’s clever fast travel system, which cuts down on pointless back and forth greatly.",,,,,,,,"The only downside to this Roki PS5 port is that it fails to use any of the new technology available to it via the DualSense. I would have loved to hear the crunch of snow come via the controller instead of my TV, and maybe let me use the touchpad to select/drag/combine items from Tove’s backpack—things that would have enhanced the experience and made it stand out from Roki‘s other releases. That said, this is a solid puzzle game and one I highly recommend devoting an afternoon or two to.",,,,,,,"It may be a fantasy story filled with legends and monsters, but Röki also has a very human message of grief and loss at its core. It’s an adventure game filled with childlike wonder, with an ending that will give your heartstrings a mighty tug. [Issue#9, p.90]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Those who played it on Nintendo Switch or PC won’t find many reasons to double dip on Röki for the PS5, but for new players, this game is as magical in 2021 as it was in 2020. A fantastical point and click adventure that carries a poignant and very human story, despite being steeped in Swedish myths and legends, this game is one of the easiest recommendations I’ll get to make all year.

I know - it's also a turn-based strategy game, what they are known for in the last few decades - but with added systems like the card games, some RPG elements and the friendship system, are adding more spice to the already perfected formula.",,,,"If not for a rather significant bug that dragged back my progress, Marvel’s Midnight Suns would have been an absolute joy from start to finish. A nice twist on the RPG format that lets you get up close and personal (platonically) with some of the biggest names in the Marvel universe.",,,,,,,,,"Don’t get me wrong, Marvel Midnight Suns fits squarely into that lineage, but there’s also much more to it than simply getting your squadmates into the right position. It’s an interesting mix, but it’s also one that the game more or less pulls off pretty well.",,,,,"The point here is that even I can enjoy this game, and I am most certainly not the target market for Marvel. What Firaxis has done is truly impressive, in taking a property that is known for big, dumb action and turning it into a genuinely interesting and furious tactics RPG. Those who are still convinced that Marvel stories are worthwhile will probably enjoy the story and application of characters, too. This means that this is going to be even more worthwhile for them. However, I do think that everyone, regardless of how invested you are in Disney’s content goldmine, will find something to appreciate about this one.","While there's a lot to love about its RPG elements and card-based gameplay, Marvel's Midnight Suns ultimately frustrates too much to be considered a true genre great. Its compelling supernatural premise and gameplay are undermined by MCU-style snark and a disappointing lack of polish, making it land with the impact of a low-charge Iron Man repulsor blast and not a well-timed hit to the face from one of Ghost Rider's patented Hellfire chains. Firaxis Games' title may be fun to play, but its story serves as a disappointing reminder of how Marvel's identity has been homogenized by a decade of formulaic silver screen dominance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The weirdest Marvel game is also one of the best. With an enormous number of complementary systems, a simple but deep combat system, and a mountain of delightful character moments to explore, Midnight Suns shines a brilliant light into one of Marvel’s lesser-known corners. This is a huge game, but also a comfortable and warm game for strategy and Marvel fans alike. Possibly the best release of the holiday season, and one of the strongest games of the year.","Marvel’s Midnight Suns proves that when the right developer is given the keys to the Marvel toy box, something very special can happen. Like Insomniac Games and Eidos-Montréal before them, Firaxis have been unafraid to put their own stamp on a beloved universe, taking gameplay elements it’s already known and loved for and giving it a Marvel makeover that just works. What could have been a simple XCOM reskin is genuinely the best superhero game of 2022, and an adventure that no fan of costumed do-gooders should miss.",,,,,,,,"Apart from the excessively long learning curve, Marvel's Midnight Suns is an amazing surprise with some of the world's most famous heroes in a different way than usual. It is certainly one of the best games of 2022 and yet another example of Firaxis' impeccable quality.",,,,,"Marvel's Midnight Suns is probably my top shocker for the year. I'm surprised at how well everything comes together. It almost seems like a bit too much on paper, but it feels amazing once you get your hands on the game. The combat is addictive and incredibly fun, and the story is pure comic book schlock in the best sort of ways. If you are looking for Marvel XCOM, you'll be disappointed, but that's the most significant ""flaw"" I can think of. Marvel fans of all types will be delighted with Midnight Suns, which is a love letter to the spooky side of the universe. It's a game that I easily see myself coming back to time and time again.",,,,"While the dialogue, of which there is a lot, can sometimes revel in its corniness, there is a lot to love in this strangely multifaceted game. Much lighter than the dark and brooding trailers suggested, Marvel’s Midnight Suns is a game that somehow mixed XCOM’s military strategy style combat with a social sim in which your character helps friends with their personal problems and forges bonds. Small strange slice-of-life options, like having the ability to have characters change clothes every day or customizing various room,s turns this into a game that you almost feel like you can live in. Which is a good thing because I did not want to leave it.",,,"Marvel's Midnight Suns is a turn-based RPG with great narrative and friendly gameplay. It has every tool to reach a young fanbase with Marvel's heroes in thrilling adventures for those who enjoy this kind of game. The only issue is that it doesn't look like a new gen game, but you can overlook that if you're willing to have fun.",,,,,"Any fan of Marvel can get Midnight Suns without a doubt. Its many references to the MCU, well-written characters and in-depth gameplay mechanics make it a pleasure to play. The game is also packed with content, so you won't get bored easily. It is unfortunate, however, that it is not very strong graphically, but that should not be a reason to pass up the game. Recommended.",,"Marvel’s Midnight Suns is a hero on the battlefield, where its card-based combat is a hit. The release’s more adventurous social aspects are conceptually interesting, allowing you to candidly interact with a spectrum of personalities, but the writing and cutscene direction simply isn’t up to scratch. It means that you’ll spend long stretches of gameplay itching to get back to the action, but the lure of the tactical battles with pull you through. It’s an unusual, unfocused title at times, but one with character and ambition that’s easy to appreciate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Saving the world involves more chatting than we expected, but by balancing combat with a hero houseshare, Firaxis has delivered one of the best Marvel games in years.

It oozes substance, which is why not many will focus on the relatively weak visuals and technical problems.",,,,,,"Marvel's Midnight Suns is a robust and very fun tactical RPG adventure with beautiful visuals, fantastic characters, a complex but fun combat system, excellent social gameplay and overall, despite the stale feel the game gives off, it looks and sounds fantastic.",,,"Even though the world is in danger and Lilith is a force to be reckoned with, Marvel’s Midnight Suns is a popcorn flick of a game purely designed to entertain its players. It can be silly! Sometimes, it will be serious. You don’t need to think too hard about it. No experience with Marvel series or Firaxis games is needed. You can hop into it, play for a few hours, and save the day alongside major and minor heroes.",,,,,,"Too much of a good thing: The outstanding combat system, including great Marvel fan service, almost sinks into an annoying mush of unnecessarily ramified micro-management, boring dialogues and boring hiking tours in environments whose optics seem to be ten years old.",,Marvel's Midnight Suns can be considered one of the best hero-based strategy games.

Despite her one-dimensional companion, she takes the foreground and never lets it go. Thrilling enhancements to combat and interesting narrative twists and connections make INTERmission worth playing.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Intermission is an excellent expansion for the world of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, introducing Yuffie Kisaragi and expanding upon her character and history in ways that simply weren’t possible in the 1997 original. She absolutely steals the show here, bolstered up by a selection of compelling newcomers and a continuation of the main narrative that teases a tantalisingly exciting future for this ambitious project. I’m unsure when we will next see something from Final Fantasy 7 Remake, but if it’s anything like this - we’re in for a treat.",,,"FF7 Remake Episode INTERmission doesn't shy away from its nature as a side story, and as a result it spends most of its time embracing the new characters and their experiences rather than trying to shoehorn them into the main narrative. While that might make the FF7 Remake DLC feel less important as a result, it also results in a tight, fun experience that doesn't take long to complete and firmly establishes another engrossing character in a FF7 Remake universe that has shown time and again it's capable of creating stars. FF7 Remake Episode INTERmission, then, is DLC that slots nicely into the gap between the first game and FF7 Remake Part 2 - it's skippable for those who aren't interested, but excellent for those who want more of the game's world before it progresses onward.",,,,"The DLC features Yuffie Kirasagi, a 16 years old ninja, whose immature attempts to make people take her seriously are both cute and comical. In combat she offers a perfect combination of agility and power. I wish her adventure was longer than 4-6 hours, introduced a new hub, and expanded the main story somehow. [08/2021, p.81]","Though Intermission reuses assets from the base game, it offers enough new and exciting material to more than justify the price of admission for Final Fantasy fans.","As far as Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade INTERmission goes as a whole, I'm really glad it exists. To be frank I wouldn't mind seeing another one of these, say for Vincent, at some point.","Square Enix’s direction with FF7 Remake has impressed me with how the extra worldbuilding and tweaks to the plot have enhanced a game I already cherished. I can’t wait to play the second part, and this DLC was a great morsel to tide me over until then.",,"Intermission has some good qualities, such as the battle system, the music and it looks great. However, it does not offer much new.",,,"Although Episode INTERmission doesn’t build much on Final Fantasy VII Remake‘s story, instead being mostly its own diversion, it’s an excellent excuse to revisit Midgar. Not that we need an excuse when it looks as fantastic as this. Yuffie makes an excellent protagonist; her combat is fast-paced and dynamic, and her straight-faced sidekick Sonon is the ideal antidote to her loveable but in-your-face personality. It may only be short, but there are plenty of side activities to keep you busy. Essentially, if you have Final Fantasy VII Remake and a PS5, then this DLC is not to be missed.",,,"If you fell in love with all over again with Cloud and co. in FF7 Remake, you’ll fall in love with Yuffie in Intermission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Short but sweet like its star.

You’ll ultimately buy it for a few extra hours in Midgar, but stay to hang out with Yuffie as we inch closer to Part 2 of this Remake effort.",,,,,,,,"Ultimately, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade offers a fun and enjoyable new adventure with new characters and new game modes that improve performance and graphics. While nothing new is added to the base game, the new modes will certainly make either replaying the game or starting it for the first time worthwhile. The DLC adds more to the story for new and old fans to enjoy. The upgraded version and DLC will certainly leave fans excited for what’s to come in future games.",,,,,,,,,"Intermission serves as a tantalizing tease of Yuffie's inevitable meeting with Final Fantasy 7's core cast, and an excellent reason to return to Midgar to experience her new exhilarating style of combat and entertaining side activities.",,,,,,"Episode Intermission builds upon the already solid foundation of Final Fantasy VII Remake and delivers a new story chapter that is both a comedy and a tragedy at the same time. It adds to the mythos of Remake’s world, gives us a new look at various side characters we only spent a few minutes with in the base game, and most importantly, sets the stage for the next crucial party member we’ll meet in the second instalment. It’s a good time all around, and I couldn’t recommend this more to fans of FFVII Remake.",,"Wrapping up my time with Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade and Episode Intermission, a few things are abundantly clear. Square Enix knows how to expertly overproportionate things and they know their fans. They’ve absolutely honed in on the combat to make it the best yet. Also, I can only imagine how gorgeous Midgar in a new light must feel to longtime fans. However, it at times dips a little into being greedy with your time when you consider the side activities on offer. Final Fantasy VII Remake and its DLC carry the feeling of majesty throughout. Yes, it’s at times arguably unnecessary. Yes, it’s ridiculous that this even exists. Still, I can’t wait to be along for every turn of the future Final Fantasy VII ride. Bumps and all.",,,,,,,,,"Episode Intermission is brought to life by its bubbly, albeit goofy, main character. I loved how Yuffie’s personality came through in the myriad ways that she interacted with each setting – i.e., sliding down poles or flinging her shuriken at far off mechanical switches to solve environmental puzzles. Exploration and combat are bolstered by an eclectic score that sports jazzy trumpets as well as roaring guitar riffs. And the level of detail that the Graphics Mode brings to flowy garments, strands of hair, and other textures never ceased to amaze me. I wish that Intermission’s narrative was a little longer so that I could spend more time getting to know its small cast but Yuffie rises to the occasion. I can’t wait to see how she fits into what’s next for Remake.",,,,,,,"Episode INTERmission is a consistently fun ride while it lasts, even if much of it doesn’t feel essential. For those who are buying Intergrade on PS5, there’s no reason not to check it out as it’s included. For those playing a PS5 upgrade of the PS4 version, who will have to purchase this episode, things get a bit trickier. I’d recommend it but do keep in mind what you’re getting. Even a completionist will likely blow through this in a few days. As long as you understand what you’re getting, though, I have a hard time imagining anyone who enjoyed Final Fantasy VII Remake not having a great time getting to know Yuffie.",,,,,,,,,,"In the end, Intermission is a pit stop, a quick jaunt into the gas station minimart of Final Fantasy VII to refuel, grab a snack, and get ready to wait some more.

It might not be a perfect remake and some gameplay mechanisms, especially the gunplay could have been better, but it offers enough action to satisfy anyone obsessed with the far east.",,,,,,"You can't go wrong with Like A Dragon Ishin. The game includes what makes the Yakuza franchise so special and combines it with samurais and Edo Period politics. A handful of oddities aside, it leans into its strengths and irons out several of the franchise peculiarities. Every gamer, either invested in the franchise or still uninitiated, needs Ishin in their console.",Like a Dragon: Ishin is a beautifully crafted re-release whose technical hiccups are overcome by its meaningful message and engaging combat.,,,,,,,,,"Like a Dragon: Ishin is a joy to play for many reasons. It has a compelling story dealing with revenge and identity, combat that is incredibly satisfying despite being a bit dated, and a setting filled with many fun activities. Unfortunately, there are technical issues that grind the pacing to a halt and can take players out of the experience. Still, when looking at the game as a whole, it is an easy recommendation, and the extended wait for fans to play it in English seems well worth it.",,,"The long-awaited remake of Like a Dragon: Ishin delivers an exciting and frequently gorgeous new setting to explore, a more rewarding combat system, and some of the best side quests and minigames in the series to date. Don't let the katanas fool you, this is the Yakuza you know and love at its very best.","Like A Dragon: Ishin is an almost stunningly intelligent game and in so many ways it is superior to the (already brilliant) series that it has spun off from. The historical setting really does the formula favours, and the development team have done such an exceptional and highly refined job of balancing authenticity and entertainment, serious storytelling and humour. At the same time, they've also maintained the core action and gameplay structures that we all love about the series. It is, simply, impossible to put down, and will be a strong contender for the best thing you’ve played this year.","Like a Dragon: Ishin! feels like it delivers on the promise of a well-timed remake for an underappreciated title in RGG's catalog. It's a refreshing adventure that's identity is both intrinsically tied to the usual crime drama RGG is known for and yet distinctly separate from the modern trappings of those concerns. Like a Dragon: Ishin! is another quality game in the Yakuza universe, and it's one well-worth exploring for anyone with even a slight interest in its stylish delivery.",,"Like any swordsman learning their craft, Ishin! starts unsteady and builds in confidence. Some ideas struggle to earn their place in the overstuffed mix, but with a propulsive tale, told by some of our favourite gaming characters, it’s easy to get swept up in Like A Dragon: Ishin!’s samurai cool.",It will blow you away by knowing how to combine a serious and solid narrative with completely absurd moments.,,,"Ryoma's story has finally come west, and it's well worth experiencing if you're a fan of Ryu Ga Gotoku's brawlers.","Like a Dragon: Ishin is worth the wait, and fans of the series are in for a real treat. However, it is a niche entry in the series and not one I’d recommend for beginners. In fact, the more of the main games you’ve played before tackling Ishin, the more you’ll get out of it. Nevertheless, it’s a great spin on the Yakuza formula, and I’m glad Sega took the risk and finally brought it overseas.",,,,"For all the game’s foibles – that largely stem from a slightly dated version of the series recipe, as well as some ideas that perhaps never really quite worked – Like A Dragon: Ishin! Is still an enjoyable Yakuza game brimming with stories and activities, and it still has a firm grip on the sense of drama and comedy that fuel its enduring soul. That soul is unique, charming, and special, and transcends setting, time, and rough edges alike.","Was it really necessary to remake Like a Dragon: Ishin!? It’s questionable, but we’re glad it’s finally available in the west in some form. It’s not the best Like a Dragon game – in fact, it might come quite low in the pile – but a good time can be had with it nonetheless. Its world might not be all that attractive, and its story a slow-burner, but it has the usual charm and a bucketload of interesting activities to carry it.","It’s been nearly a decade since Ryu ga Gotoku Ishin! released exclusively in Japan, but RGG Studio has finally brought it over to the West in the form of Like a Dragon: Ishin!, and it does not disappoint. Not only does Ishin! touch upon an important part of Japanese history, it does so by excellently balancing ridiculously fun over-the-top action with engrossing narrative pacing and mature character development. It doesn’t quite meet the bar of a full on remake though, so that’s something worth considering.",,,,"When is a remake not a remake? Ishin at times feels like the developers cut corners by incorporating existing models from other games and the original. NPC characters and animations lack refinement and didn't get the overhaul you would expect from a remake. However, the cutscenes and the original story remains strong and the gameplay with its new use of weapons and the added team cards are solid as ever. Together, Ishin fails to rise above the average, which could have been easily avoided.","A fascinating game in many aspects, that rewards the patient, curious player. An adventure worthy of the legendary franchise it comes from.","Like a Dragon: Ishin! is a lost classic that has finally made its way to a global market. Fans of the franchise will be ecstatic to experience an Edo-period drama that features icons of the Yakuza series. Even though it is set in the 1860s, the foundation of the series is evident with each step. It’s a familiar experience that feels similar to its PS3 counterparts rather than the modern releases. The world lacks the hustle and bustle of Kamurocho and the mini-games are not as diverse. However, the card-based combat system and four fighting styles make battles a thrill. While the game may not do enough to alter the perception of those who don’t enjoy titles from the franchise, fans of the series are in for a treat with this samurai-focused epic.",,"Like a Dragon: Ishin is an excellent remake of an older unappreciated RPG with an impeccable historical story to tell. While the remake isn't in the best condition it could've been, especially on PS5, it is still a game that will provide players, especially Yakuza fans, lots to enjoy.","With a great story, charismatic characters, fluid and fun combat and a gameplay that is the hallmark of the franchise, Like a Dragon: Ishin! is the remake fans wanted so badly. Even with small bugs, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio shows, once again, that the series' formula is far from boring and makes us anxious about what will come ahead.",,,"Like a Dragon: Ishin is simply another well-made game in this infinitely original series. It may be a bit rusty, not quite up to modern standards, but it nevertheless is a lot of fun and offers all the things people want from and love about the Yakuza series.","Like A Dragon: Ishin! is a great game, but doesn’t do much to stand out against other games in the series. The story and setting are novel and interesting, however, the combat lacks any sort of balance. Even so, the excellent melodrama is worth seeing through to the end.","Like A Dragon: Ishin! is Ye Olde Yakuza, but that's all it needs to be. The setting is fresh for the series, and it provides a fun way to see the same crime drama action in a new historical setting. Even if I prefer the modern setting, Ishin handles the change of setting well. It doesn't break an molds, but it's a delightfully fun experience for fans of the franchise. If you're itching for more Like A Dragon, Ishin! scratches that itch wonderfully, and it's a darn fun game in its own right.","You sometimes notice that this is an old PS3 game, but on most points Like a Dragon: Ishin! stands up fine. Although you have to keep Wikipedia open next to it to find out what some historical dialogues actually mean.",,"Like A Dragon: Ishin, offers both a familiar Yakuza experience in an entirely unique setting. Some technical issues and arbitrary systems can't hold back a compelling narrative, excellent combat, and a compact open-world packed to the brim with engaging content. Like A Dragon: Ishin shouldn't fly under your radar during this busy period, and is well-worth diving into for both series veterans and newcomers alike.",,,,,,"I wasn’t sure what to expect from Like a Dragon: Ishin!, but I have to say it is a very well put together game that offers plenty of fun. Even on harder difficulty settings you feel like you have a fighting chance, but the farming of materials will take some time, so it will eventually start feeling repetitive. There is plenty of content to keep you entertained, and the game diversifies and adds new gameplay elements up to the end. It might not be the most memorable of the series, but it is a game that is worthy both of the Yakuza and Like a Dragon series.",,"Ishin not only features classic themes Like a Dragon is known for, but it also manages to mix in enough variety in its mini-games and side stories to give us a new way to enjoy all the action, brawls, and ridiculousness we have come to expect from the series.",,,"The wait has been worth it: Like a Dragon: Ishin! is another great instalment in RGG Studio's series. An often gripping story is made even better by the game's historical leanings, while a rewardingly intricate combat system gives the gameplay an addictive hook. Add all of those typically barmy Yakuza side activities into the mix, along with some delightful references to past games, and you've got the makings of a fan favourite.",,,,"A welcome novelty and throwback for long-time Yakuza fans, that offers everything they love about the series, although it’s held back by a rather underwhelming plot and too much fan service.","Like a Dragon: Ishin! provides the show and offers fans of the ""Yakuza"" saga an epic feudal epic at will. This remake in no way distorts the original 2014 experience, but modernizes the visuals and gameplay enough to make the adventure memorable a decade later. Ishin! is not perfect, far from it, and has some shortcomings, especially technical. However, the pleasure of playing a “Yakuza” game is there, and that is the main thing.",,"Like a Dragon: Ishin absolutely revels in the Yakuza series’ weirdo humor, but that’s only one half of the equation. There’s also a genuinely dramatic samurai story sizzling with tension. Ishin has some of the best storytelling the series has ever seen. The only thing holding it back is a convoluted combat system that takes a while to find its groove.",,,,,,,,,,,The long overdue samurai spin-off is classic Yakuza under its period dressing but also underwhelming as a current-gen remake.,,,,,"Exactly what fans of the series have come to expect, whilst still providing one or two interesting deviations in gameplay along the way, Like A Dragon: Ishin! fuses familiar traits with a delightfully-versatile combat system to great effect. Those worried that a game both spin-off in nature and far-flung from the series’ present day roots would feel too isolated should take comfort from the fact this year’s remake of a pre-0 entrant remains quintessentially Yakuza in all the right ways. And while the take on style-switching, combo-chasing combat this time round is admittedly imperfect and far from the most fluid system to engage with, some occasional scuffs and rough edges aren’t enough to deter Like A Dragon: Ishin! from coming away as one more worthwhile and thoroughly-entertaining spin-off in the Yakuza series.",,Quotation forthcoming.,"Like a Dragon: Ishin is a stellar period piece filled with melodramatic monologues, great combat, goofy side content, and a whole lot of heart.","Like A Dragon: Ishin is a really fun spin off for this long-running series. Many of the big characters from the mainline Yakuza games, bar some of the newer games, are recast as new ones but none of the impact is lost. Edo Period Kyo is a great city to explore with plenty to offer players, and the combat styles are really fun to experiment with, even if Brawler is a bit wasted. The long wait for a Western release has been worth it.","Like a Dragon: Ishin! is a game that both delights and frustrates me for a lot of reasons. I don’t feel like the shift to Unreal Engine 4 added anything substantial, and it seems to have come at a steep cost compared to the framework the studio normally uses. The drawbacks make this fully-remade title feel like it would have been at home two generations ago, rather than belonging next to Lost Judgment and Yakuza 7.",,,"Buoyed by a fantastic setting, Like A Dragon: Ishin! is bound to be a treat for all fans of the series.",,"Like a Dragon: Ishin! paces itself halfway between a proper remake and a simple remaster, delivering an experience that visually and structurally appears close to the original game and feels inevitably dated. However, the story, characters and contents will once again please the fans of the series.","Like a Dragon Ishin is a must-attend event for longtime fans of Kiryu Kazuma and other yakuza legends. It is in fact an adventure full of fanservice, both in the purely playful (with the Trooper Cards) and narrative fields, restored in Unreal Engine 4 to be even more pleasant from a visual point of view. At the same time, however, various aspects of the combat system and the very structure of the game world clearly indicate the true age of production, which has its roots in an era prior to the advent of the Dragon Engine, with everything that follows. Furthermore, as pleasant as it is to explore the mid-19th century Kyo, the events narrated have some imperfections, both in terms of effectiveness and rhythm, and fail to reach the same emotional peaks of the saga's cornerstones, such as the never forgotten Yakuza Zero.","Yes, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio could have redone this with the Dragon Engine and yes, it plays exactly like the original, which is a game from nine years ago, but Like a Dragon Ishin! is still a delight for both newcomers and old time fans alike.",,,An action-packed and emotionally-charged adventure through a breathtaking period in Japanese history.,,,,,"Like a Dragon: Ishin in my eyes earns the lofty score I’m giving it. The game is the most fun I’ve had with a single player game in years, and getting a review code for it the same day as Hi-Fi Rush left me spoiled, incredibly tired, and astoundingly happy. It’s worth your time and your money.",,"While its half-baked gunplay should probably have remained holstered, Like a Dragon: Ishin!’s stylish sword fighting and over-the-top Trooper card attacks successfully pair the Yakuza series’ brand of hysterical action with the historical fiction of its 19th century Japan setting. Unfortunately, its step back in time also presents a slight step down in quality for its substories and side activities, which have each been eclipsed in entertainment value by the other Yakuza and Judgment games in the years since Ishin’s original Japanese release, and the blander areas of its low-tech environment can’t quite compete with the flashy charms of Kamurocho when it comes to exploration. Even so, its high stakes story had me hooked throughout, and it was fascinating to get an insight into a period of Japanese history I knew very little about previously, albeit through a heavily fictionalized lens.",,"Ishin is playfully outdated in some areas and the technology is not entirely convincing. Series fans will still have fun with the atmospheric title. Newcomers, on the other hand, should rather choose another game from RGG.",,"At its best when its focus is divided, Like a Dragon: Ishin! is a fun Bakumatsu sandbox. It doesn’t have the engrossing standout minigame like the cabaret or business management challenges of previous titles, and its time period means it also doesn’t pack a fun arcade. But its jack-of-all-trades approach still resonates.",,"It’s an exemplary Ryu Ga Gotoku title. Fans of the older Yakuza games and Judgement will feel right at home amidst its familiar gameplay mechanics and story beats, and the polish applied to these facets will ensure they’re well rewarded for the time they invest in the game. It’s a welcome return to the series’ past, and a good sign of how well the series will hold up moving forward.",,"Like A Dragon: Ishin! has a bit of ironing out to do before it becomes the amazing game it deserves to be. Players may notice it is the least polished game in the series in some time, and be tested by a slow start to the narrative and rolling out of mechanics to engage in chaotic fun. It’s worth sticking it out though. It’s one of the better stories to come from the franchise, with gripping inner and political conflict, where steel collides and wounds (both physical and emotional) cut deep. Kyoto too is home to some of the better instances of minigames and sub-stories, getting good mileage out of its feudal Japan setting. Living out your samurai life is palpable and thoroughly enjoyable as you cut down anyone who stands in your way in engaging combat. Like A Dragon: Ishin! may not be an all-timer for the series, but it’s definitely the title with the best vibes.",,,,Like a Dragon: Ishin! It is a very Yakuza-like game but in a Feudal Japan setting. It's great to see familiar faces in another setting and interpreting a story based on true events. It maintains the playable bases of the series as well as its mechanics that will keep us busy for a long time.,,,"As a remake, Like a Dragon: Ishin! is nothing special, but fortunately the game, despite its spin-off nature and a few wrinkles here and there, has little to envy the other chapters in the series.",,"Like a Dragon: Ishin is an awesome spin-off to an already-great series, and one I'm glad finally came to the States. Even if it tripped on the landing, the story kept me gripped, and I hope some of the new combat styles and special moves make their way to other RGG games. I also hope we'll get the other spin-offs that never made their way over. Time will tell, but for now, it's nice to be back with my favorite criminals.",,,"Like a Dragon: Ishin! despite being set in the distant past, is unmistakenly bore of the same DNA of the Yakuza series proper and will be a treat for fans of the long-running series.","Recovering from the mists of time an old game like a Dragon: Ishin! may be a risky choice, but the restoration operation can be considered perfectly successful. Perhaps the overall variety doesn't quite reach the heights of insanity of the very latest chapters, but the fun offered by the classic arcade combat system is still very much up to date, classifying Ishin! as a successful exponent of the celebrated series.",,,"While not the best game in the series, Like a Dragon: Ishin! offers great fun to long-time fans while also delivering an excellent opportunity for those interested in these games to jump in and see what all the fuss is about. While it’s a different take on the classic formula, there’s enough here that still feels like a Like A Dragon game to provide an idea of whether this series is for you.","While it definitely departs from the usual formula for the series, Like A Dragon Ishin is undoubtedly worth your time. While this isn’t a story of true history, the game is happy to educate you on Japanese culture of the time – a helpful Glossary option will pop up for many terms unfamiliar to an English-speaking audience, so you’ll be able to tell your joshi from your goshi and shishi – and suddenly, Final Fantasy XIII’s naming conventions make a lot more sense. Becoming a badass, unstoppable samurai seems only right for someone who looks like Kiryu, and the story will keep you guessing to the end. Also those cucumbers are almost ready to harvest, so don’t forget to stop by the villa soon.",,,,,,"Like a Dragon: Ishin! is a remastered blast from the past that will appeal to longtime Yakuza fans, but a dated design and some bugs make the game feel rough around the edges.",,"Like A Dragon: Ishin! does exactly what it says on the box. It takes the recognisable characters that have appeared throughout the series and transformed them into 19th-century analogs. The super dramatic storyline, backstabs and betrayals remain pleasingly offset with the eccentric substories that feature memorable characters in the wildest of circumstances. Kiryu-Ryōma-Saito remains the ever-loveable stone-faced uncle driven by honour, stoically seeking the goodness in hearts everywhere before curb stomping a handsy mugger.",,,"If you somehow haven't played any Like a Dragon games in the past, Ishin is an excellent starting point. Although it doesn't tie in with the core series in a major way, Ishin hits all of the broad beats of the Like a Dragon formula to great effect. The result is a remake that doesn't feel all that dated whatsoever and proves that Sega and RGG Studio made a fantastic decision to finally bring this title to a much wider audience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Playing Like a Dragon: Ishin! took me back to the feeling I had when I first played Yakuza 0, which is not a bad thing! Though it isn’t the pinnacle of the series, Ishin delivers a pure Yakuza experience that will delight both long-time and new fans. It’s an expertly told melodrama punctuated with moments of genuinely breathtaking absurdity. In other words, it’s a Yakuza game. And frankly, if this actually were a historical drama in the running for Best Picture at the Oscars, it would absolutely get my vote.",,,,,,,"As fascinated as I am by the main story unfolding across Ishin’s cutscenes, I’m doubtful this is a game I will or should stick with.

grand-theft-auto-v,,,,,,,"Into its 3rd generation and GTA V is still printing money for Rockstar. The new generation version is not as jaw-dropping as it was almost a decade ago, but it is the best way to play it if you are one of the very few who hasn’t already; And even if you did, the current discounted price might tempt you to give it another try anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The next-gen upgrades alone have added depth to much of the gigantic world of Los Santos, and it's...beautiful. Just beautiful. I can't figure out if it's because I'm a nostalgic ex-Los Angelino or because of Rockstar's success in continuously refining and polishing the environments. Either way, there are multiple reasons to praise the next-gen version of GTA V and GTA Online, but be warned that the new player experience is still much to be desired compared to other MMOs. If you own a PS5, you should definitely take advantage of trying out GTA Online before it becomes a premium game in a few months.",,,,"GTA 5's enhanced next-gen port is definitely the best way to experience the game, and it's still every bit the enjoyable experience it was in 2013. However, with almost a decade having passed since then, Los Santos has started to show its age. GTA 5 lacks the detail or cinematic presentation of Rockstar's own Red Dead Redemption 2. Animations look less fluid, melee combat feels antiquated, and gunplay - even with the addition of haptic feedback on the PlayStation 5's DualSense controller - lacks weight. RDR2 is still without its own next-gen upgrade, while Red Dead Online continues to languish without new content. Together with the official confirmation that GTA 6 is in development, this new port feels like a step backward when Rockstar should be looking to the future. It's still a great way to play Grand Theft Auto 5, but even with the visual improvements and new multiplayer content, it feels less like a necessary return, and more like an aimless jaunt.",,,,"GTA V aged really well and it was a pleasure to return to Los Santos. Almost a decade later the attention to details is still amazing, literally beyond reach of most modern games. If you’ve never played this classic, you really need to catch up. However, if you’ve already finished it on PS4 or Xbox One, you will lose nothing if you ignore the next-gen edition, as it does little beyond adding new rendering modes.",,,,,,,,,,,"GTA V on PS5 is the best version of the game. The 60fps make it feel smoother to play, with faster load times being a welcomed improvement.",,"With the next-gen version Rockstar has brought us the ultimate version of Grand Theft Auto 5.

A version purely made for newcomers or true fans of GTA 5.",,,,,"Without any content additions for those who have already explored every alley in Los Santos, this version of GTA V may not be enough for veterans, but it remains a true masterpiece in the new generation. It also supports 60 fps or the ultra-high definition in 4k, making it the best possible way to enjoy this great criminal journey.",,,,,"The faster loading times and graphical bumps still make this a good-looking game, despite the age of the assets. The solo campaign still has some allure, and the online component has proven its staying power. If you've already played the campaign to death, then you might be tempted to grab this because of the ridiculously low, temporary intro price. If you're an avid GTA Online player, then you may be on the fence given the segregation of online populations. This version means that the wait for GTA6 is going to be painfully long, but what's here is solid enough to tide one over until that finally arrives.",,,"Even though it’s not the ‘Expanded and Enhanced’ version we were hoping for, Grand Theft Auto V on current-gen is the best way to play the game on console. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles showcase their finest traits, improving load times drastically while adding minor technical improvements that make the experience that much better.",,,,,,,,"Picking up this latest installment of GTA 5 can only mean you either haven’t played the game yet or want to start it over on a faster, more powerful console. Either choice is fine and means you will be in for a real treat as this is the definitive way to experience its 30-some hour story by far. GTA 5’s graphical improvements and even current gen features like haptic controls somewhat update the game to today’s standards, but it does show its age and makes the case that this should be the last time it gets released again.",,,"GTA 5 is beginning to show its age, but it’s a testament to Rockstar’s original vision that Los Santos still stacks up. The improvements to image quality and framerate give this sunny sandbox a new lease of life, and while some of the single player gags may not hit as hard as they did in 2013, there are still plenty of memorable missions across the release’s 30 or so hour running-time. Meanwhile, GTA Online’s freeroaming multiplayer lobbies remain unmatched, and while newcomers may find the learning curve borderline impenetrable, if you can overcome its idiosyncrasies there’s nothing quite like the crime caper on offer here.",,,"Enough (online) open world games have appeared in recent years, but none like Grand Theft Auto 5. Thanks to this next-gen upgrade we can enjoy them again, at least until GTA 6 is released. Enough reason to rate this upgrade with a more than satisfactory.","The 60fps option improves the gameplay to a small degree but, almost a decade later, it’s not the graphics or the story that impresses the most in GTA 5, but the open world design. It’s the one element that is beyond criticism and while it is beginning to seem a little old-fashioned compared to newer titles like Zelda: Breath Of The Wild and Elden Ring it’s still lightyears ahead of any of its would-be rivals.","With this third release on PS5 and Xbox Series, Grand Theft Auto V has never looked so good on consoles. 4K resolution, framerate at 60 frames per second, Ray-Tracing... This port effectively uses the technical capacities of next-gen consoles to offer the most pleasant rendering possible, in particular with greatly reduced loading times. Beyond that, GTA V remains what is, namely an incredible open-world filled with activities, but which dates from 2013 and which therefore shows the number of years on certain points such as facial animations. But more than the single-player mode, it's above all GTA Online that stands out as a winner from this arrival on PS5 and Xbox Series with the addition of a tutorial for new players, exclusive content and all the game's graphic and technical improvements. based.

Native 4K, 60fps, Ray-Tracing, these tweaks make this version of GTA V the best looking and the best as well.","GTA V is at its best when leaning into the cinematic blockbusters that it takes inspiration from, while at its worst when trying to be controversial for the sake of it. Thankfully, its striking open world and variety of missions – most notably, Heists – help the Rockstar game hold up remarkably well in 2022.","The standard remaster features are here, but not much revelatory. Best recommended for newcomers, or those already locked into GTA V’s online ecosystem.

Like any remaster, the HD makeover can’t hide all the signs of aging from a game that launched two console generations ago, but beyond that impresses. The PlayStation 5 iteration is every bit of the hilarious thrill ride it was back in 2013. Everything played through during the review was familiar territory, but it was just as captivating and entertaining as it was the first time. But by the same token, outside of technical improvements made possible by the more-powerful hardware, there isn’t much of anything new being brought to the party. This is the best way to experience Grand Theft Auto V, but faster loading times and high resolution and framerate might not be enough to necessitate upgrading to modern-gen consoles. It’s still a great port of one of the best games of all time, but it doesn’t drastically improve much over the PC and last-gen version.",,"We cannot deny Rockstar could and should have done more with its most successful game ever, but the experience is still fantastic and better than many other open world games that came after.",,,"GTA V is the high-water mark for the developer as a whole.

diablo-ii-resurrected,,,,,,,,"While the remaster brings little new to the table other than a fresh coat of paint, cross play and remade cutscenes. Diablo II and its expansion feel as exciting, threatening and as ruthless as ever. The lions share of the quality-of-life improvements are found in the console version, with an excellent use of the controller, added hotkeys and general accessibility. Yet, the remaster does nothing to dumb down or meddle with the overall experience. Instead, for returning players, this is Diablo II as you remember it to be. For new players, while missing a lot of features that most ARPGS have today, there is a lot to love about this aging gem and it is still worth experiencing even decades later.",,,,,"Certainly it's great to see an all time classic enshrined and restored for modern day use. Additionally it opens up the game to exclusively console players that never played the original Diablo 2 on PC. There's no denying its significance in gaming history, and looks wonderfully sharp in 4k, but the age of the source code is evident. Diablo faithfuls will get a great nostalgic kick on the clunky ever-grind that is Diablo 2: Resurrected, but it would be a difficult recommendation for any series newcomers.",,,,,,,,,,,"Diablo 2 remains a seminal ARPG and a defining gaming experience. For many Diablo 2: Resurrected is just another excuse to play a favorite. Other players may see it as an ancient relic, barely approachable with its stagnant, unevolved gameplay. For me, it was a harrowing hill to climb, a portal through time, but one I ultimately could not help but regret that I had not gotten to it sooner.",,,,,,,,,,"Diablo II: Resurrected did what it was supposed to as a re-release, and it managed to simultaneously preserve the original game.",,,"Diablo 2 Resurrected is ridiculously gorgeous and enthralls us into its dark world, despite some annoying quirks from the past - like the outdated item management - still being with us.",,,"Never would I have believed that in the year 2021 I’d be sat playing Diablo 2 on a console. And thanks to Diablo 2: Resurrected, with its wonderfully mapped controls and stunning visuals, it doesn’t have to be an eyesore or an ordeal. Some will instantly be put off by the lack of local co-op, but for those happy to play on their own or with others online, Diablo 2: Resurrected remains one of the best action RPGs of all time. It may be a bit clunkier than I remember it to be, but not offputtingly so, and once you’ve taken your first steps and started developing your character of choice, it’s hard to not be totally consumed by the game’s dark world and all that it offers. Diablo 2 is back, and until Diablo 4 emerges from the bowels of hell, it’ll do just nicely. Though I’ll probably be playing it beyond that, too.","Diablo II Resurrected offers fans of the original game exactly what they want – the same game they left behind in 2002 with gloriously updated visuals. Everything works well on the controller (despite some inventory issues). New players might take a while to acclimate to the somewhat dated gameplay mechanics, but settling in, they will find a ton of enjoyable adventuring to be had with friends.",,,,,"We enjoyed going back to Sanctuary. From its endless fighting and looting, to its characters and epic story. But if you don´t treasure memories from the original Diablo II (it´s been more than 20 years since it was released) this RPG feels repetitive and some mechanics are outdated.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Diablo 2 Resurrected is a brilliant way to rediscover an indisputable classic, whether you're a veteran or taking your first look back at Diablo's roots.",,"A true classic of game history with a lovely new livery, however, outdated game design is cause for some frustration.",,,,"Diablo II: Resurrected is a mixed bag of treats. On one hand it has the sweet allure of nostalgia, on the other hand it often feels outdated, with mechanics that evolved quite a lot in the last 21 years. The multiplayer is tremendous fun and will cause a lot of discord over splitting the loot and stealing the gold dropped by the dead players. If you feel nostalgic for Diablo II: Resurrected is the best way to scratch that itch. If you felt that it was overhyped back then, the new release will do nothing to change your mind. And if you are new to videogames, you better start with Diablo III, since you will not miss anything story wise, and the experience will be much more satisfying.",,,,,"So it's a very, very good remaster (remake? It's unclear when this much has been done over), then, of a rather old loot game that has had many subsequent iterations from other developers. Is it worth going back to Diablo 2, ultimately, when games that we'd argue are somewhat superior — Titan Quest, the sadly PC-only Grim Dawn... even (controversially, yes) its own sequel in Diablo 3: Ultimate Evil Edition, which packs in brilliant local co-op that Diablo 2 entirely (and understandably, given its framework) lacks. As good as Diablo 2 is, it's an unfortunate fact that on console we'd rather play its follow-up, which felt more tailored to the joypad experience. Diablo 2 is a PC game that has been (brilliantly!) transferred to PS5, but it's still a little held back by its origins.","Diablo II: Resurrected is a video game history lesson that everyone should know, but apparently they didn't learn from their mistakes. Resurrected is far from perfect and Blizzard didn’t use this opportunity to polish combat mechanics.","Diablo II: Resurrected brings the legend back in some style, with all the old joys and all the old pains as well. This 20-year-old holy relic is, in some respects, far surpassed by its successors and its systems sometimes grind to a halt, but the magic is still here, as strong as ever.",,An exacting remake of Diablo 2 that will not only please those that played it the first time round on PC but works impressively well on consoles too.,"Rarely has a game been so aptly named. Diablo II Resurrected is indeed a true resurrection of a PC classic from the 2000s, in a technically updated version, but which scrupulously respects the original gameplay. A project that could have been a big deal in many ways, but Vicarious Vision has enough faith in the original material and hardly changes the game design and interface.",,,"Diablo II: Resurrected is Diablo II in everything that matters. Its strict adherence to the tone, themes, and even gameplay of the original makes this an incredible time capsule, revisiting a classic restored, yet not iterated on. It’s the best of both worlds; a game that looks and plays wonderfully in 2021, but embodies the dark experience that was first brought to the world more than 20 years ago. They just don’t make games like this anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The original Diablo 2 was the pinnacle of dungeon crawlers in 2000, but in its present form, it is more of a fossil. Vicarious Visions has done an incredible job of encasing it in amber. I loved my time with it, despite the flaws that are still visible through the shell. For better or worse, history remains.",,,,,"Diablo 2: Resurrected is a great remake of a real classic. It looks and feels just how I remember it from playing in the early 2000s, but with cooler lighting and sharper graphics. It has a few control issues with when using a controller, but it's still a must-play for anyone who used to play it and misses it, and a strong recommendation to anyone else who likes action RPGs, dark and grim atmospheres, or who just wants to experience a treasure from the now distant past.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With its pros and its cons deliberately left mostly as sharp as they were, confirming itself as one of a kind not only for the nostalgia effect on which the Vicarious Visions have focused, Diablo 2: Resurrected has thrown the Blizzard masterpiece twenty-one years forward with a crazy care. It was not and is not a game for everyone, but what a pleasure to deal with the Devil again.",,,,,,,,"Some technical shortcomings and a few content we would have liked to see but that Blizzard fails to provide. Nonetheless Diablo II was, is, and always will be a classic gaming experience and this new version certainly is the right tribute to the game, should you revisit or discover it.",,,,,,,,,,,"A stunning recreation of Diablo 2, this will be essential for gamers of a certain age, while the uninitiated will probably get more of a kick out of it as a game design time capsule than a series contender in the sea of live games vying for their attention. If nothing else, Diablo 2 Resurrected is the definitive version of a classic.",,,,,,,,"Diablo II is one of the best ARPG's in gaming history, and Vicarious Visions haven't made many changes for Diablo II: Resurrected. Visually, there's a stark difference and it looks great while keeping the atmosphere. A few quality of life changes help keep this fresh and make it playable on consoles, but it just doesn't go far enough at points. This ageing master may have had a facelift, and it's one you can have a fantastic time with, but you can hear the creaking of its bones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether that’s in the early stages and upgrading the HED to have more features, or through different blocks you can use in the puzzles. There are blocks you can jump on to reach higher spots and others which catapult you to new areas. As such, everything is constantly updated and feels fresh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Entropy Centre is, ultimately, a game that charmed and frustrated me in the best possible way. It doesn’t quite reach the level of its inspiration, but it does deliver the perfect puzzle experience of beating your head against the wall until you get the dopamine hit of figuring out the perfect solution.So, if you go into it looking for a brilliant puzzle game that just happens to have a decent sci-fi story attached to it, it’ll be exactly what you expect.",,"The Entropy Centre is a masterclass in intuitive, creative and exciting game design. From the first puzzle to the last you’ll be staggered by the imagination on display, and as you rebuild the world around you you’ll have a few chuckles along the way, too.

While the lack of in-game prompts poses a challenge to some, its absence encourages players to strike out and explore on their own and organically find solutions to puzzles. The puzzles are challenging, but solving them without any help from the game feels rewarding, encouraging players to keep moving forward. While some minor annoyances can be found in its controls, no glaring issues exist that cannot be fixed with a simple patch. Overall, FAR: Changing Tides perfectly executes its simple gameplay, offering players a truly memorable and immersive experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Far: Changing Tides isn’t going to be for everyone. But if the idea of a quiet, lonesome adventure about keeping your boat moving forward puts wind in your sails, you’ll love it. There’s a wonderful soundtrack to enjoy, and the puzzles it presents to you are engaging and well thought-out. But sometimes it’s just a little too barren for its own good, and the awkwardness of controlling your ship can get in the way of its serenity.",,,FAR: Changing Tides is a beautiful game with a stunning soundtrack that puts you in control of a ship you'll build a fantastic bond with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As someone who usually doesn't enjoy meditative gaming experiences, I must admit that FAR: Changing Tides completely captivated me.",,,"FAR: Changing Tides even when it's at its best feels like the game world itself: empty. It feels a bit that the game aspect was less important than the experience part. I believe FAR: Lone Sails offers a much more dynamic experience than the sequel. Yet, despite its shortcomings, FAR: Changing Tides is just as recommendable, especially if you liked the first game in the series. It has a kind of magic that is worth experiencing at least once, even if the replay value is quite thin. Is it for everyone? Definitely not! But those who look for their games off the beaten path, FAR: Changing Tides won't disappoint.",,,,,"FAR: Changing Tides is largely more of the same. With how good the first title is, that’s not a bad thing, but it leaves a little something to be desired. Great sound design and music, as well as incredible environmental art, don’t quite balance out the pacing issues, hard as they try. Your new vessel has more components to juggle than last time, and it’s mechanically satisfying, but you spend too much time doing it. While traveling underwater does add a new gameplay component to account for, the puzzles don’t offer enough of a challenge. All that said, Changing Tides is still worth your time.",,,,,"More meditative than contemplative, FAR: Changing Tides is an invitation to tranquility, so assertive that it sometimes becomes sluggish.

[Issue#364, p.112]","Life is Strange: True Colors is a technically brilliant and emotionally-driven masterpiece, providing a compelling narrative wrapped around some of the best choice-based gameplay I’ve experienced in years. It also made me reflect on what my life can be if I just take a minute to let go, which isn’t something I can say about many other pieces of art or media.",,,,"Life is Strange: True Colors is, without a doubt, the best in the series in my opinion. After some disappointment with Deck Nine's previous work, True Colors has managed to win over my heart and for the first time in a long while, care for a narrative driven game like this one.",,,,"Life is Strange: True Colors is an incredibly endearing game, with a wonderful cast of characters and the charming town of Haven Springs proving to be a standout. Some narrative hiccups were not enough to stop this game from resonating with me, and one of my only complaints is that it was over all too soon.","Life is Strange: True Colors sets a new bar for the series. Deck Nine does a stellar job of exploring painful topics that evoke true emotion both in-game and out, using its cast of well-written characters and set pieces, all packaged within a gorgeous environment and a beautiful soundscape.",,"Life is Strange: True Colors is a game that constantly aims higher, but never really takes off. Neither the power, nor the story, nor the environment are up to its greatest virtue, which is none other than Alex Chen, its main character. The good ideas are weighed down by the timidity of a game that does not end up betting on its own proposals. There are things to rescue, it has a good rhythm, and it is easy to get into, but it is within the best installments of the franchise.",,,,,"Life is Strange: True Colors has the best characters in the whole series, but at the same time, it also has the weakest story. The narrative takes way too long to take off, and by that time, it might already be too late for many players.","Life is Strange: True Colors is a unique game, unlike anything I have played before. It is a departure from the other titles in the series, while also retaining the soul of what made people enjoy those games so much. With a stronger focus on interpersonal relationships and genuinely empathizing with those around you (both friend and foe), it feels like the series is finding its footing and pushing forward to bigger and better things. The decision to switch from the episodic format to a full upfront release pays off and I think Life is Strange: True Colors is much better for it. Once I got invested in the story, I did not want to stop playing, and I think a lot of the decisions and connections you make would start to lose their meaning if there were an extended break in between chapters.","The writers from Deck Nine and DONTNOD have demonstrated that their gift is not unlike Alex's. They have an empathy and understanding of the struggles that humans face. Life is Strange: True Colors builds on what the first installment did well, and does it even better. No game in the series so far has reached this height of catharsis, and by the end of it, players will be heartbroken to leave the imperfectly perfect town of Haven Springs.","Life is Strange: True Colors is a rumination on loss, empathy, and finding your place in the word. A great cast is bolstered by improved visuals, animations, and a truly remarkable protagonist in Alex Chen, making this the true highlight of the series.","You will be forced to make hard decisions and live with them as Alex Chen, some of which will have an irreversible impact on the narrative. Yet there’s no harrowing conclusion to be uncovered here. Much like real life, each revelation is a punch you must roll with, whether it’s losing a loved one or conjuring up the courage to confess your love to a crush. No matter how trivial or monumental, True Colors makes each moment matter as it forms the identity of a woman I came to care for and relate to in ways that few games have managed to achieve. This brings me back to the sibling bond between Alex and Gabe, and how it feels like a virtual replacement for the bond between myself and the brother I wasn’t able to bid farewell to. I had that chance here, and I can’t describe how much that means to me. Without being overly poetic or needlessly saccharine, I’m glad more games are engaging with how we can learn, grow, and love as human beings, and the rewards that come with accepting such hardships along the way. Life is Strange: True Colors truly is something special.",Life is Strange: Colors effectively leads you through an emotionally impactful story with strong character development through the power of empathy,,,,,,"Life Is Strange drifted away from exciting teenage stories towards serious narratives commenting on our reality.

The narrative should be uncovered as you play it, and going in with as little knowledge as possible will make those twists and turns have that much more impact. This is without a doubt the best game in the series yet. The characterisation, the worldbuilding, the visuals, the facial animations – practically everything here is flawless. With True Colors, Deck Nine has solidified itself as the master of narrative adventure, and I can't wait to see what comes next.","Life is Strange: True Colors is a fantastic slice of life from an idealized alternate universe. Alex is an excellent protagonist, and her adventures with her attractive, funny friends in their beautiful town is a great way to spend about twelve hours.","Life is Strange: True Colors is exactly what Deck Nine meant it to be. It's difficult, even when you know exactly how someone feels to say the right thing, encourage the right path, and keep hold of your own emotions too. It's tender but funny. It's cheesy yet sincere. And those of you that loved the original Life is Strange will likely love this, too.",,Interactive possibilities make this dorky tale about a small-town psychic musician strangely absorbing.,,"With Life is Strange: True Colors, Deck Nine has recreated with faithfulness the ""Dontnod formula"", so if you are looking for a story about the weight of emotions, putting the spotlight on the things that matters and with lots of hard decisions... Don't look any further.",,"Life is Strange: True Colors is not a perfect game and it is difficult to compare it with its predecessors, since each one is special and has a totally different approach. It can be classified as the most mature of the saga, although it has some problems when it comes to dealing with the psychological factor surrounding the protagonist.",,,,,,,,,,"There’s no denying that Life Is Strange: True Colors does things a little differently from previous games while retaining that signature look and feel that we’ve come to expect from the series. Overall, it’s a solid effort from Deck Nine and a considerable step up from their last take on the series, Before The Storm.","It is rare when I find a game that tries to capture real people and nails it so well. Every aspect of Life is Strange: True Colors — from the dialogue to the characters to the paths they took — is real and vivid, and I fell in love with all of it almost immediately. If the ending doesn’t get people talking for the next several months, we’ve failed as a society because the entire final two chapters were impossible to look and walk away from. The game is an absolute gem and shouldn’t be overlooked.",,"Life is Strange: True Colors presents a tale of empathy as you witness a town struggle to deal with a tragic event. I enjoyed my time in Haven, especially when seeing the world through the eyes of different characters and the ending presented an interesting twist. However, it's all over quickly and the mystery-solving portion is lackluster but it's an ultimately rewarding experience.",,,"True Colors is a worthy continuation of the franchise. Releasing all the episodes at the same time was a good call, since you can go through the story in one sitting, offering around 8 hours’ worth of emotional journey. It is not perfect, and it would have deserved a more elaborate ending. It cannot be as emotional as Before the Storm or as important as the first game, but it keeps the best parts of its predecessors and adds some new elements that fit seamlessly in the mix. It is mandatory for all the fans of the series and a must try for those who think video games should be about much more than just shooting and explosions.",,"These small flaws aside, True Colors is tugs at your heartstrings and doesn’t let go until its credits roll. It’s a wholesome game that covers some deep subject matter, but gives it to you in a way that makes for an enjoyable viewing and gaming experience. Fans of the series will love how familiar it feels to the other games, but everyone will appreciate how mature its themes are that continue to emphasize the uniqueness and unexpectedness life can bring – superpowers in hand or not.","Another interesting story, supported by believable characters and excellent voice-acting. It’s a shame the graphics aren’t always up to par. The current-gen optimalization also needs some improvement.",,"Life Is Strange: True Colors had every chance of becoming the series' best game to date, but it's been let down by arguably its most important element: the story. Wonderful character work can only go so far carrying a narrative that just isn't particularly exciting. And while Alex's power crafts one interesting scenario after another, it too isn't enough to offset those dull plot points. With an awful framerate to boot, Life Is Strange: True Colors falls short despite everything it has going for it.","Life is Strange: True Colors offers a solid narrative with many options to unlock and a mystery to solve. Yes, it sounds like more of the same, but the investigation and the story development through the perception and emotions of others make this a unique and enjoyable experience. Even with its flaws, you will enjoy the new Deck Nine game.","A modern narrative adventure game with an amazingly lovable heroine and plenty of strong scenes. But it’s also a tad too ambitious in scope. It looks great, sounds great and its story holds together for the most part, so in the end, you should probably play it. Just not on consoles!",,A charming addition to the Life Is Strange franchise that has one of the best branching narratives in any video game and one of the most likeable set of characters.,"Life is Strange: True Colors is an experience that can be appreciated in the sweetness of its journey, sublimated by shimmering colors, animations more accomplished than ever and very beautiful melodies. With this episode, Deck Nine Games chose to explore empathy from top to bottom; a preponderant aspect in the powers granted, the narration and the construction of the characters. The whole provides a very neat adventure on a human level, but which undeniably lacks a certain liveliness in its actions and the unfolding of the plot. The result is an investigation that lacks a certain panache.","True Colors is the best game in the series since Before the Storm, and it will satisfy your narrative craving for a time.","While Telltale has shut down and Life is Strange isn’t the surprise hipster hit it was in 2015, True Colors shows that there are plenty of themes, characters, and superpowers for developers to explore in the future.",,"Life is Strange True Colors has everything that fans of rich storytelling will love: a varied cast of characters, an intriguing setting to explore, and the chance the affect the overall outcome of what happens, putting the storytelling right into the player’s hands. While at times the game does feel slightly more linear than previous titles and plot points can feel rehashed, it’ll keep you coming back to the town of Haven Springs time and time again. It’s a game about walking to the beat of your own drum — we’re all on a journey of self-discovery and emotion, and Life is Strange True Colors reflects that to its core.",Life is Strange: True Colors is the third installment of the award-winning saga conceived by Dontnod but it is the first one developed by Deck Nine Games. Right from the start you will be highly captivated by the story of Alex Chen and Haven Springs. Too bad only for some problems related to the narrative rhythm that do not allow the game to make the definitive leap in quality that it deserves.,,,,,"Haven Springs will work its charm on you. Alex Chen is easy to root for and her story is well worth playing for Life is Strange series fans and newbies alike. [Issue#6, p.78]",True Colors has a tremendous potential but all its new gameplay mechanics aren’t able to provide us a good storytelling.,,"Critically, True Colors' story is well-rounded, with a satisfying and definitive ending for both its central mystery and for Alex's personal journey (and as all good thrillers should offer, there is a resolution you can deduce for yourself if you are paying enough attention). It's not a failing to me that True Colors tells a lean story which prioritises quality over quantity, feelings over finer details, and a sense the series, like Alex, has come back to its roots after a period of absence and change. [Recommended]",,"Deck Nine got a chance to prove itself with Life Is Strange: Before the Storm, but if there were any lingering doubts about where the developer can take the franchise, they’re surely cleared away with True Colors.","True Colors is worth exploring in its entirety, but it glosses over the rougher parts of life, painting them in a romantic light.",,,,,,"Life Is Strange: True Colors is an incredible new addition to the series. It brings perhaps the most likeable protagonist yet, the absolutely gorgeous Haven Springs, and an excellent supporting cast together for an intensely emotional but hopeful tale. With enough gorgeous sweeping cinematic shots to put an indie film to shame, and some absolutely incredible writing, Alex’s journey is something you must experience.","Life is Strange: True Colors presents a great adventure in this beloved series with significant choices and player-driven interactions. The result is a beautiful story of empathy and new beginnings where players have the freedom to shape the narrative the way they want and deal with the consequences along the way. The character animations and voiced dialogue only elevate it to new levels of quality, but long loading times and strange responses can hurt the pacing tremendously.",,,,"Life is Strange: True Colors is a complete title that will take around nine to ten hours to finish. This might prove a bit steep for the price, but the pacing and character work do well to make this story worth the time. The colourful visuals compliment Alex's power, but there are a few rough patches along the way. Despite the soundtrack of original and licensed songs blending into the world, the Live Stream mode is half baked and should be revisited in the future because as a shared experience; this game shines with complexion.","Technically speaking the best entry in the series, Life is Strange: True Colors takes up and improves the path traced by Dontnod with the original Life is Strange.","Life is Strange: True Colors is the largest and most ambitious chapter in the Square-Enix series, but it does not reach the narrative depth of the previous chapters.",,,,"I had waited with bated breath to play Life is Strange's next narrative adventure and I can honestly say I wasn't let down. Every expectation was met and then some. From the deeply impactful writing, the consequences of choices, and the attention to every detail, True Colors was an experience that I can't wait to start all over again.",,,"Deck Nine and Square Enix took a gamble when ditching the episodic blueprint for Life is Strange: True Colors. But the decision has paid off, delivering one of the series’ more refined entries to date, and one that isn’t hampered by needless padding. Even though it’s held back slightly by one too many glitches, Haven Springs is a joy to explore, and Alex’s journey of grief and the importance of expressing your emotions is one that will stay with me for a long time to come.",,,,Life is Strange: True Colors is an emotional rollercoaster that highlights everything that makes the series great.,,,,,,"Life Is Strange: True Colors is right up there as one of the best games in the series, if not the outright best. Its characters are interestingly complex and believable, the writing is strong — albeit a bit clichéd in true Life Is Strange fashion — and its more sinister narrative has plenty of twists and turns that’ll keep you hooked. It’s all punctuated by heartwarming, lighthearted sections reminiscent of Before the Storm’s beloved ‘play’ scene, and its decisions will have you second-guessing yourself for hours. The whole experience is wrapped up in the strongest presentation values and a soundtrack that never skips a beat. This is a must-play for fans of the series, and a serious contender for my Game of the Year.",,"While the original game remains a touchstone for me, Life is Strange: True Colors is the best iteration the series has seen yet. The narrative adventure also betters the diversity the franchise is already beloved for, providing an exceptional hero in an authentic, badass Asian-American woman that can be LGBTQ+ (should they so choose it). Filled to the brim with narrative and character twists at every turn, this is a game that made me laugh, cry and fall in love. With moments that hit like a bullet train, Life is Strange: True Colors is a must-play. Jump on in and feel all the feelings, friends. You'll be glad you did.","Life is Strange: True Colors has a lot of the ingredients that make the series so beloved, most notably in its compelling protagonist. Technical advancements for the series bring its story to life with fantastic performances and a keen eye for detail. Unfortunately, the story it brings to life is full of stutters and stops, and takes far too long to develop. Where Life is Strange games are full of movement, True Colors feels painfully stagnant for too long.",,,,"Life is Strange: True Colors is a must-play for anyone with even the vaguest interest in the series. It takes everything that has made the franchise good and elevates it to new heights. This is Life is Strange at its most confident, its most sentimental, and its most engrossing.",,"Life is Strange: True Colors is a lovely tale about empathy, self-acceptance and humanity. Probability it's not the most original or neither the neatest one, but it's something that we probably need these days.",,"True Colors’ writing is so strong that it didn’t need a supernatural ability to tell this story. I laughed, I cried, and the things that stick with me are the moments where Alex is tested and comes into her own. And there’s something special in how True Colors gives you the power to decide her future and what her life needs, making for a memorable ending with a highlight reel of what you envision for the character. Due to all branching choice variations, you can probably get in a few different playthroughs, but the overall message never changes: Don’t give up. It may be a well-worn saying, but it means a lot in Alex Chen’s pained life.",,"When Alex experiences joy for the first time, a warm golden glow emanates from the characters, sparkling and twisting into the laughter-filled air. Life Is Strange: True Colors fills my heart with the same sensation. Then breaks it in the most bittersweet way I could imagine. Alex’s story is a colourful tapestry, stitched together with the gossamer thread of what it means to be human. It’s a glimmering, supernatural journey that reminds you life really is… weird.",,"Life is Strange: True Colors catches up with the original Life is Strange on a narrative level and, unsurprisingly, improves the experience with superior graphics quality, remarkable voice acting, and a beautiful soundtrack. Once stepped out of the bus, it will be easy to totally identify with Alex and be carried away not only by her search for truth but also, more simply, by the everyday life and warmth that only a place like Haven Springs can offer.",,,"At times funny, exciting, mysterious, and heartbreaking, Life Is Strange: True Colors made me fall in love with this little town and all of those who live there. I hope this isn’t the last we see of Alex. A character this wonderful deserves many adventures to come.",,,,,,"Life is Strange: True Colors is an excellent entry in the series, and a great place to jump in for newcomers. Some technical issues can’t be overlooked now that it’s a full-priced title, but it’s something that seems easily fixable with a patch or two. Alex Chen is an incredibly endearing character that asks us to face our grief and empathize with other people’s struggles, reminding us of our shared human experience.",,"Outside of a few flaws, True Colors is the peak of the Life is Strange series to date.","The best Life is Strange game yet. Through the concept of empathy, True Colors manages to drive video game storytelling to new heights. An expanded scope, hugely impressive production values and new, bingeable format make this a must-play for fans of narrative adventures.","There is light that developer Deck Nine just never allows darkness to touch, and there is joy to be had in being able to play some small part in making sure they all do better. But the disconnect between that vibe and the turmoil that brought Alex here to begin with is tangible, and the game would achieve brilliance if those two concerns could connect. Dropping by Haven Springs is still time well-spent--but it's simply a pleasant visit, rather than a powerful, emotionally resonant one.",,"Life is Strange: True Colors grapples with some heavy emotions -- literally and figuratively -- and manages to stick the landing more often than not. The various chapters range from fine to great, with more being somewhere just above good than not. Its choices felt meaningful, its dialogue largely heartfelt, and I’m still thinking about the ending days later. It’d be easy to boil the game down to being a glorified empathy simulator, but the reality is that Life is Strange: True Colors is more complicated, more beautifully complex than that. And for a game in part about the manifestation of emotional resonance, it does end up being emotionally resonant. It’s hard to ask for more than the delivery on that promise.",,"Life is Strange: True Colors might feature grown-up characters, but it's evident the franchise itself still has a bit of growing to do. Deck Nine tries and ultimately fails to tell a story of emotional healing at best. At worst, it treats difficult topics with a flippant callousness that suggests it doesn't quite understand how to deal with these emotions to begin with, let alone tell a meaningful story about healing and moving on.",,Life Is Strange: True Colors sets out to explore the concept of empathy and it succeeds. The game is able to discuss and handle many serious topics with care while also managing to tell a meaningful story of loss and acceptance. The game introduces one of the best protagonists in the franchise yet and excels in its core gameplay mechanics.,"There isn’t an easy way to recommend Life is Strange: True Colors. It, like the rest of the Life is Strange franchise, isn’t a typical game. It’s more akin to a visual novel or point-and-click adventure. The game is a slow, enjoyable experience, perfect for when you want to wind down for the night or get up in the morning. More than that, though, it’s an emotional triumph. Experiencing Alex’s adventure and seeing the world through her excellently crafted perspective is a joy that hit me harder than I expected it to.",,,,"The anthology format has helped keep Life is Strange fresh across three main entries, but it also comes with a significant risk. This is a series where so much relies on your investment in the characters; these stories work because you want to help characters like Max Caulfield and Sean Diaz live a better life. Luckily, despite a new setting and lead, True Colors has exactly that. I played through the entire thing in two sittings — not because I had to see how it ended, but because I needed to make sure that Alex was alright.",,,"Life is Strange: True Colors is another success for Deck Nine, highlighting how well they understand the source material and its connection with the audience. The new characters, location, and power are an instant classic of the series and we can only hope they continue to develop this world alongside DONTNOD.",,,,,,,,,,,,"The end result is a remarkable, powerful game. Life is Strange: True Colors stays true to the series’ roots, using supernatural twists and an underlying mystery as the backdrop for a story that’s focused on the quiet beauty of everyday life and the connections that form between people. Within that, it carves its own path with a moving exploration of the power of empathy and the importance of finding a place to call home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tails-of-iron,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Odd inventory design niggles aside and shopworn concepts aside, Tails of Iron is beautifully presented and a roundly entertaining, surprisingly grim action RPG that boasts a grandly enjoyable combat system. Fans of punishing action RPGs and grimdark fairy-tales will find much to love here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tails of Iron is an expertly crafted effort from Odd Bug Studio. The visual style alone is worth the price of admission, but the additional tough-but-fair combat, RPG-lite components and engaging exploration makes for a worthy entry into the Souls-like subgenre.",,,,,,"With its tough-but-fair combat, timeless storybook visuals, and unique furry fantasy, Tails of Iron is one of the year’s most distinctive RPG experiences. The intentionally subdued pace and challenging nature will definitely test the impatient, but anyone looking for a knuckle-cracking slugger, powered by a tale of valor and vengeance, will find Odd Bug Studio’s sophomore effort washes down like a fine flask of Bug Juice. Rest well, Redgi, your friends have done your memory proud.",,,,,,"Tails of Iron isn’t the biggest adventure in the world – while it has numerous maps to explore, they’re not particularly expansive – but it does have a lot of heart. It’s easy to warm to Redgi despite him not having a voice, which is quite an achievement in itself, and as you travel around his kingdom, fighting off bugs, frogs and other pesky creatures, you’ll come to care about his fate. It’s the combat that’s the real star of the show here though, encouraging you to keep an eye on the various quest boards even when the tasks they offer only send you to the same few locations.",,,"Tails of Iron is a charming and often brutal Souls-like adventure, with some wonderful combat mechanics and a gorgeous hand-drawn world.",,,,,,,,,,,"Tails of Iron is a fantastic, brutal, and gorgeous game. Placing rats at the forefront of an adventure game was a bold move, and serves the world that Odd Bug Studio has created immensely. The battle between the frogs and rats is intense, the combat is challenging - yet fair - and the wide variety of equipment is sure to make any RPG fan excited to experiment with new loadouts. I enjoyed every moment spent in the Rat Kingdom, and can only hope to see more from Redgi, his brothers, and this fantastic world.",,,,,,,,,,"Tails of Iron is a good game, although it cannot actually fit into one certain genre. It is not very deep or complex, as developers rather focused on implementing well a few elements. Thankfully, the exploration and combat system work like a charm and turn this rat tale into one worth experiencing. Its 2D world is truly engaging, while the challenging combat offers plenty of satisfaction once it is mastered. Tails of Iron might not be an overly ambitious game, but it is entertaining and rewarding.",,,,,,,,,,"Even if Tails of Iron has some flaws, starting with its back and forth and its combat system that lacks evolution, the title is simply charming. Helped by its panoply of charismatic characters, its sumptuous visuals and its successful fights requiring precision and coordination, the creation of Odd Bug Studio offers a magnificent journey that we can only recommend ... at least, if the difficulty does not suit you. Don't be afraid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This is an enjoyable Souls-like that simplifies the formula but focuses on the right elements to make it work.,,,"Tails of Iron borrows inspiration from other challenging games, but its beautifully crafted world and thought-provoking narrative definitely deserve your attention. Every new area offers more to explore and tests your skills to see this rodent’s adventure through until the end. Tails of Iron is an under-rat-ed gem that will make a mighty fine addition to your indie game collection this year despite some rare bugs and needed updates to the combat systems.",,,"While it never totally fails to be an acceptable action RPG, most of Tails of Iron’s initial appeal doesn’t outlast its humdrum gameplay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Backed by a stunning art style and the voice of Geralt of Rivia, Tails of Iron is an excellent action-adventure RPG that offers a challenging yet satisfying Souls-inspired experience in a captivating medieval world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sifu,,,"Sifu is a challenging, brutal and, at times, extremely frustrating game. It had been a while since I screamed with anger the as I did with my TV these past few days, death after death, beating after beating, cursing the world, the enemies, and my own incompetence and lack of reaction time being knocked down again and again. But it's also an extremely rewarding game to evolve your character, not only through unlocking new abilities but also through your own understanding of its mechanics, movement, going through the different combos, and even the different ways to block and avoid the various types of blows coming your way.","It's never easy. But somehow, when we fall, it only makes us all the more keen to dust ourselves off and get up again. Once we've taken that calming breath, at least. [Issue#369, p.108]",,,"SIFU puts you in the shoes of a martial artist, and I mean it literally, as you will have to have patience and practice a lot to master your skills and time every single one of your moves precisely to be able to beat your enemies. It’s not an easy game and probably not too appealing for everybody, but it certainly rewards patience and practice, and once you finally get into its core, you will have a hell of a good time.","It seems coming at this game late has given me a more positive perspective on Sifu. Whilst the Student difficulty wasn't available at launch, it does help wash away some of the repetition that can potentially grind a player down. Honestly, I felt the combat more than pulled its weight and controlling an encounter can feel incredibly rewarding. There's a challenge to be had but it's one that can be overcome with patient observation and persistence.",,,,,"Sifu has an extremely high skill ceiling and very deep gameplay, paired wonderfully with stylized visuals and great art. The gameplay is extremely refined, but Sifu's narrative just feels unfinished as a whole, and could have been the difference from Sifu being a lot more than what it is.",,,"Sifu aims to bring the essence of Kung-fu to the screen, and to the controls, with a combat system as demanding as it is inspired, set in an inspired space that draws on all the tropes that usually accompany this type of story. The result is an experience that achieves what it sets out to do, making each confrontation feel like a real duel between martial arts experts. A must for anyone who enjoys a good combat system.",,"Sifu is a great beat'em up, with challenging bosses, and an intelligent progress system. It's satisfactory to beat because you feel how you've improved on the way.",,,Sifu is a fantastic indie game that makes you feel like a Kung Fu master. Sloclap has created an experience that lovers of beat'em ups cannot miss.,,"Sifu is a one-of-a-kind rogue-like that marries an engaging setup with sublime combat mechanics. It scratches that integral itch that fuels subsequent runs, and it tries its best to avoid the feeling that time has been wasted. Progression exists in many different forms, but Sloclap's standout title pulls off one of the more impressive versions of it. Sifu shows players they are actually getting better at the game.",,"As someone who adores games like Spelunky for forcing the player to digest every bit of information, Sifu strikes that exact same spot with the force of a freight train, delivering a combat system that is truly unrivalled. As a game, it's one of the most engaging I've played in some time, it's just a shame that it won't appeal to all players thanks to its surprising difficulty and that it took some developmental liberties with representing Asian voices.","Sifu is a gorgeous, original and intelligent brawler whose self-confidence is leveraged by its masterful ageing mechanic and super tight combat.",,"For beat ’em up fans starved for new games to play, Sifu remains an obvious recommendation. Even those taken by its copious charms will want for more after they’ve seen it all, however.","Sifu made me regequit a handful of times and yet it quickly became one of my favorites, especially thanks to its bald and punishing learning curve, that pushes you into mastering all sorts of moves and combos. French studio Sloclap delivers a typical revenge story, that is wrapped in a clever level design and excellent gameplay mechanics.","Sifu is a master of hand-to-hand combat, injecting its kung-fu showdowns with exhilarating fluidity, tactical depth and cinematic scale. Its structure is harder to fully embrace, though, as it demands a lot of repetitious dedication to even reach the final stages. At times that feels needlessly punishing, but the thrill of the fight should help pull you through.","Just like with Souls, you feel good when you manage to take out a boss or complete an area without taking damage as planned. The word is rewarding. The game is Sifu.","Sifu is a soulslike beautifully translated into the language of beat ‘em ups. Yes, the protagonist will die hundreds of times, but remarkably fluent combat system, a multitude of surprises, attractive visuals and terrific music will keep hardcore fans of either genre glued to the screen.","A potential GOTY contender already, Sifu is martial arts excellence that’ll challenge and delight in equal measure.",,"With Sifu, developer Sloclap is asking a lot from players. From the punishingly difficult combat that takes hours to learn and tens of hours to master, to the need to repeat and near-perfect levels to lower your starting age, this fighter can be an absolute slog. However, for those who can grit their teeth through the losses and frustration, you’ll come out smiling on the other side having played one of the best games of the year.","If don't mind some challenge, and if you enjoy combat-oriented gameplay with martial arts theme, then Sifu is something you should try on. It's a nice mix of Fighting Force and Sekiro.",,,"The reverence for Asian martial arts films of all kinds is evident in Sifu. But in mixing ‘of all kinds’ together, it diminishes the individual identities of each. Just like martial arts films are more than a select sequence of fight scenes, culture is more than a cool aesthetic. Sifu uses homage to include everything, say nothing, and is ultimately just vexing.","With Sifu, developer Sloclap has delivered one of the most striking and original roguelikes we’ve ever had the pleasure of playing. Like the process of actually learning a martial art, this is a game that requires practice and patience – and the rewards speak for themselves.","Sifu is the epitome of a well-made martial arts video game that infuses cultural storytelling, brutal combat and a dash of roguelike. With its beautiful art direction, excellent soundtrack, and immaculate attention to detail, it is sure to rivet the attention of anyone interested.",,,"The Chinese term “kung fu” roughly translates as “a skill acquired through hard work and practice”. Sifu might just be the purest expression of the concept that games have ever seen. The journey is brutal. It is not for the faint of heart, nor the short of patience. But those prepared to rise to the challenge will find that something spectacular comes after the pain. Is it worth the hardship? Ask me when the wounds have healed.",,"If you're looking for simple, direct action, this game is not for you. But if you are a stubborn player who loves to be tested, with Sifu you will get one of the most thrilling games in recent times. It's as hard and irresistible as martial arts.","Sifu is built around the idea of mastering a skill. Whilst this is the mantra of the protagonist, you will also play by this code and refine your skills after each attempt. The combat is sophisticated, containing enough variety and depth to be challenging yet accessible. Without any difficulty options, some may struggle as it requires time and patience, however, learn the mechanics and you’ll find one of the greatest and most rewarding fighters in the genre.",,A wonderfully difficult beat-'em-up that puts the player at the forefront of their very own martial arts epic.,"Sifu is an amazing action game with rich and challenging combat that constantly forces you to think about how to better face and survive certain situations. The low variety of enemies and the short duration are a little disappointing, but they are minor stumbling blocks for an excellent title.","Sifu's combat is impeccable and one of the best gaming experiences I've had since Batman: Arkham City – fluid and visually beautiful to watch, accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack in a work that has nothing to do with any great martial arts film. Another factor that is worth noting in the new Sloclap game is how it doesn't get tiring despite the short story and non-stop beating. There's not a lot of dialogue or construction for a simple narrative, but it works perfectly well: in revenge, all that counts is to take down everything and everyone. And make no mistake: no game over will be in vain, as each run is a learning experience within Sifu, and with the minimal shortcuts and facilitators available, the coveted revenge will be achieved before the age of 70.",,,,Perhaps one of the best compliments I can give to Sifu's essence is this: Playing and improving in this game actually seemed to make me better at other games. What's more kung-fu than that?,"Sifu may cost you several years of your own life, but is well worth all those hours of training.","SIFU is one of the best titles that came out so far this year. A game that requires full patience and commitment, and rewards attention and dedication with some of the best-executed action sequences and most satisfying combat I've played in years.","Through neoteric ideas around what combat can be, many of which were conceived with Absolver, Sloclap has carried the classic beat ‘em up into the present with Sifu. It might be brutal and unforgiving, but it never feels cheap and it’s a pleasure to continually learn the complexities of kung fu while bathing in the world’s surplus of flair and ferocity. So push through and persevere, because there’s one hell of a game on offer here.","While the lack of a story felt like a ton of missed potential, the gorgeous art and the beautifully complex but fun controls kept me enthralled. The difficulty was ridiculously high but the developers have already stated they’re working to patch that. For people looking for a beat ’em up style game, Sifu offers one of the most remarkably unique entries into that genre, especially if you want more from your beat ’em up than button mashing.",,,,,"Sifu is a memorable game. It is also a hard game that rewards patience and the willingness to perfect yourself. It is not perfect, but it is fair. One of the few negative aspects we encountered is the camera control that in some scenes it is not just a pain in the ass, but it can cost you an entire run. Another thing we would have oved to see is a more detailed character building, where the story is not just a frame for the action. But all these are just minor inconveniences when we look art Sifu as a whole. It does not feel like an indie game, but still, it is not for everyone. You need patience and you need the ability to get over the countless moments when the game frustrates you to the limit of exasperation. It is all part of becoming a kung fu master, a path reserved only for a few.",,"Replaying the same level over and over again to grind out XP you need to advance isn’t a challenge, it’s poor design. Randomly making your enemies invincible to spice up the difficulty isn’t a challenge, it’s poor design. I could go on, but I think this review is becoming like one of Sifu’s levels – endlessly repeating itself.",,,"Sifu doesn't pull any punches. It's a consistently challenging and demanding beat-'em-up, but persistence pays off. You'll be hard pressed to find a more rewarding game on PlayStation — especially one that's so visually striking and polished. Some quibbles with combat mechanics aside, Sifu is a knockout.",,,"Technically and mechanically, Sifu is very solid as a strong roguelike beat-'em-up with a slick style and atmosphere. However, if you haven't reached a state of enlightenment and eternal peace, this can be an extremely tough game for you and the euphoria of success should keep you going for hours of rehearsal and practice. But it is well worth it, in my opinion.",As a straight action game the core combat is elegant and original but the roguelite structure makes the already mountainous difficulty just too much to bear.,"SIFU is a vibrant and powerful tribute to the martial arts. Sloclap undoubtedly masters its subject and the genre in which the title fits. In just two games, the Parisian studios demonstrate their know-how in the field, and in fact become recognized artisans of the video game fight. This Beat'em All hits hard and with conviction, and perpetuates this noble art of kicking and kicking in a demanding and inspired quest for revenge. The title of Sloclap, due to its raised difficulty, is intended for tenacious, even relentless players, and could discourage more than one, but learning martial arts requires self-sacrifice and self-control… like SIFU.","Maybe the visions in Sifu lie in the traumatised mind of the main character, who remains more elusive than any of his foes. The game’s tagline ponders, “Is one life enough to know kung fu?” But, in the fractured figure of its hero, a deeper realisation occurs. It may not be enough to know yourself.",Sifu’s singular focus on the perfect run leaves the essential feeling of incremental progress too far out of reach.,,"Sifu offers plenty of unique promise, but it's no kung-fu master yet. The difficulty spikes will be off-putting for some, but others may enjoy the challenge, but the way it stacks the odds against a player is more frustrating than fun…And yet, players looking for a new challenge might want to pick up Sifu. Even though not every design choice feels like a good one, the foundation and potential for something truly amazing are there.",Quotation forthcoming.,,"Sifu's deep combat and ageing mechanics aren’t for everyone, but those keen to roll with the kicks and punches will find one of the most satisfying and addictive brawlers of recent times.","A real homage to kung-fu movies, and especially those from Hong Kong, Sifu is a stylized, hard-hitting beat'em all with gameplay that borrows from rogue-likes. If you like the challenge, don't hesitate any longer, it's a really good game, made by fans of the genre.",,"Brawling with goons is fun, but the demand for perfection when facing difficult bosses leads to wearying repetition, even for those who like harder games. [Issue#12, p.90]","The next big thing in the beat em up. Delicious in his playability and fresh in his visuals. Needs more charisma for his characters, but his lack of great heroes and villains it's served with his fighting mechanics. Maybe the biggest step in the XXI century for the genre. [Recommended]",,"Where Sifu most earns its seriousness, for me, is in that largely unspoken marriage of combos and counters with questions of perception and synchronicity. This is a game about the punch-drunk unevenness of time, and the way that unevenness depends on the mind you bring to bear. [Eurogamer Recommended]",,,"Sifu is a no-nonsense arcade brawler that can be played in short bursts or long sprints, depending on the commitment to perfect each level run.","Sifu is incredibly frustrating because beneath all of its messy, clunky contrivances, there is a fantastic action game that I really, really want to play. But Sifu can’t get out of its own way, and its high-concept ambitions spoil its fundamental pleasures.",,"Sifu preaches patience as it brutalizes your very existence in every way imaginable. But if you stick with it, and continue to learn from your mistakes, you'll eventually get your revenge and find the peace you were looking for.","Sifu reimagines old-school beat-em-ups with great ideas and a fantastic combat system. It is tough, but if you’re up for a challenge, make sure to check it out.","Sifu is an incredible journey. Featuring top-notch animations, music tracks, and visuals that are hard to match by even a big-budget animation studio, you will find your jaw-dropping as you make your journey through this story of revenge.",,,,,"Despite a of couple hang-ups, Sifu should be commended for injecting a sense of danger and realism back into the beat ‘em up genre.",,"A great combat system with extraordinary mechanical solidity, amazing aesthetics, and a brilliant and brutal difficulty management, make Sifu a must play for any action lover.","Wanting to think of a comparison that is not too bold, it could be argued that Sifu is literally like a diamond: shining, very hard and obviously not within anyone's reach.","Sifu is a real gem with an astonishing and technical combat system that only few can master. It is undoubtedly a really hardcore game, suitable for those who love only though challenges.","Sifu is surprisingly difficult, at a level that will deter most players. However, getting past that wall will reward you with an amazingly crafted game that stays true to the developer’s vision, one that celebrates kung fu and its core meaning.",,,,If you ever wanted to feel like the main character in a martial arts movie then look no further than Sifu. Sloclap deserves kudos for such a finely crafted combat system that hosts a diverse selection of defensive and offensive moves while being simple and straightforward in their executions.,,"Sifu will age us as the main character ages, but it also gives us some of the best martial arts moments in video games, which make us say, like Neo in the Matrix, ""I know Kung-Fu"".",,,"Sifu's brutal learning curve and unique structure that requires you to beat it in just one lifetime are significant barriers to overcome, but on the other side is truly one of the best modern action games around.",,,"While Sifu is a challenge that will test your skills and the durability of your controllers, fans of Soulslike game and kung fu will have a lot of fun beating down thugs in a variety of environments.",,,,"It all meshes together into a game that's far too difficult and without the satisfaction that comes from making progress in a difficult game. It's like bashing your head against the wall, and unlike other games with this approach, the wall isn't starting to crumble. The wall has grown a smug, laughing face as it prepares to take away one of your character's most important abilities, just in time for the final boss battle.","Sifu is a game that could have been something amazing, with its fascinating premise and superbly crafted and fluid combat mechanics and animations. However, the game’s frustrating need to make the gameplay ridiculously hard just left me tired and annoyed. Sloclap really needs to think about how they can make this game more accessible, possibly by including more shortcuts, an adjustable difficulty setting, or just lowering the impact of health lost from fighting your average foe. Hopefully they will bring in some patches that will address these issues, but as it stands, I’d wait before investing time in the world of Sifu.",,,,,,"Sifu is a great beat em‘ up game that discourages mashing buttons. The combat system stands out as a mix between the Batman: Arkham series and Sekiro, with a heavy emphasis on precision. It is a demanding game that penalizes mistakes and rewards skill.","Sifu is an uncompromising and merciless fighting game, but for this very reason it manages to give great satisfaction.",,"Like a 20-year-old combatant, Sifu comes out of the gate strong. Its core combat feels excellent, and the moment-to-moment action looks better than most Hollywood blockbusters. Sadly, as you progress, the action begins to show its teeth and eventually becomes a tiresome grind. Sifu deserves props for its incredible sense of style and tone, but it is also a great example of why growing old isn't always fun.",,"Despite an excellent combat system and intriguing world design, Sifu falls too short of its premise. Regardless of whether you’re playing it casually or going harder, the death mechanic is simply too punishing to be enjoyable. Perhaps with a fairer system, this would make for a better game.",Sifu is a masterfully crafted lesson on patience.,,,,"Despite some frustrating design choices around progression and a camera which isn’t as consistent as I’d like, I had more fun with Sifu than the vast majority of action games on the market. At the end of the day, it just feels too good to play for me to deny. Even as I replayed levels dozens of times when I really wanted to see what was ahead, I couldn’t put the controller down. That’s the sign of a master right there.",,,,"The aging mechanic in Sifu presents an engaging challenge, while the visuals and combat keep you invested. The backtracking and slow progression can be frustrating though, and the story could be better.",,"Sifu is intimidating but rewards patience and perseverance. An engaging tale of revenge is presented with slick confidence, but it’s the fluid fighting mechanics that really shine. It has the perfect amount of depth without being needlessly complex, putting a sense of weight behind every blow. Sloclap has delivered something special, and it’s up to you to experience it.",,"There are so many games out there that do what Sifu does only better. Honestly, if you want a punishing grind where your efforts will actually pay off you’re probably better off just taking a Kung-Fu class in real life.","A challenging brawler that punishes recklessness and demands perfection, Sifu’s genre-leading combat and roguelike mechanics blend together to create an early Game of the Year contender.","Sifu will likely ignite the difficulty debate once again, and it's certainly a shame that more people won't get to experience the game because of the barrier for entry. There's design and mechanical justification for having such a steep learning curve, though, and it's part of what makes Sifu so compelling. Your journey from student to master is thrilling, mainly because it's governed by your own improving skill level rather than traditional character progression. There are memorable moments that stand out throughout, such as the boss fights and an enjoyable recreation of the iconic hallway scene from Oldboy, but it's Sifu's combat that shines through most brightly. For as unique and interesting as its aging mechanic is, it wouldn't work without the combat carrying the load and ensuring that each replay is just as engaging as the last. Is one life enough to know kung fu? Maybe not. But I would happily spend mine playing Sifu to find out.",,"While the story itself will never be enough to compel you forward, there is a sense of connection in watching your character get older while figuring out the intricacies of how Sifu plays. That's ultimately what makes its punchy and punishing gameplay all the more satisfying.","The fantastic gameplay, the beautiful graphics, and the amazing soundtrack just to name a few things make this an enjoyable experience. If you are not a fan of difficult games, I’d recommend renting this one first if possible because it is an extremely difficult game at the outset and will require a grind to be successful. But if that doesn’t bother you in the slightest, then come on in; the dojo is all set up.",,"A brilliant take on the roguelike genre, Sifu is a game that is hard to beat, but even harder to put down. Timing, patience, and skill will see you to fulfilling your goal and exacting that sweet revenge.","Sifu took me 15 hours to beat and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute. With such replay value and an appealing price point, it’s easy to recommend to everyone, especially if you’re into modern roguelikes or From Software games. And that’s without mentioning how it pushes past some of its inspirations with its cinematographic flair and haptic combat. Sifu is as much a tightly told vendetta story as it is a masterful brawler. It’s an easy game of the year contender, and it’s only bloody February…","A rewarding experience from its start, Sifu delivers challenge after challenge, all of which are too exciting to turn down.",,,"Is it worth the effort? Like we said: The highs here are very high, the sense of potential mastery potent. (Game looks great, too, with a fluid, slightly cartoonish style.) But progress will take a certain bloody-minded persistence—and a willingness to overlook the game’s various crimes against authenticity. (To be clear: This is a team of French developers making a video game about what they think an Asian martial arts movie looks like; it’s so divorced from anything resembling a story about real people or cultures as to land somewhere at the intersection of stereotype and cliché.) With those caveats in mind, though, Sifu remains the kind of game it’s hard to stay away from for very long—for no other reason than a desire to take vengeance on it for what it did to you the last time you played.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fans of beat-'em-ups or kung fu movies will instantly fall in love with Sifu. If you can handle replaying levels multiple times, it's a must buy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An excellent time sink where you can meticulously craft your ultimate theme park. If management sims interest you and you haven't checked the game out before, now is a great time to pick it up. If you already have the game then there's not much that will draw you towards buying this version, simple as that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Planet Coaster: Console Edition is the kind of game that's great fun at its core but being able to get the most out of it will require a lot of patience. So, it's worth playing if you enjoy fine-tuning every intricacy of a park and don't mind getting used to its controls.",,,,,,"A worthy attempt at making a theme parc simulator work on consoles, Planet Coaster will keep you playing for a long time to come. At times you can get dragged down by unnecessary details, though... and the voice-acting isn’t particularly convincing.",,"If you enjoy business management simulations, then we recommend purchasing a ticket for Planet Coaster: Console Edition. While the coaster creation controls can be unwieldy, Frontier’s done a generally decent job of mapping a very complicated title to the DualSense controller. The title allows for a ton of creativity, but time-strapped entrepreneurs can also have fun with the many pre-made assets available. It’s the kind of game where, once you begin building a park, you’re basically pledging the next 30 hours of your life to doing it properly – but once you start seeing those profits rolling, you may find it difficult to quit.",,,,,The console version of Planet Coaster contains all the charm of the PC version.,,,"Planet Coaster is a solid theme park sim, and one I can see myself spending an unhealthy amount of time playing. I just need to remember not to be too hasty in loading games the second I get to the PS5 dashboard. Twice now I’ve immediately tried to boot it up within a minute of the PlayStation 5 getting to the home screen and crashed it so hard the console databases need rebuilding.

It may have gorgeous particle effects in abundance, but what it's really missing is a spark. [Issue#364, p.110]","Kena fills the void left by a now-scarce genre that used to be far more common than it is today. It’s a simple story of love and loss with gorgeous visuals and a play loop ripped straight from the PS2 era. I would have liked a few more concessions to help players navigate the world and its challenges, but I still enjoyed my time here — it doesn’t reinvent the action-adventure platformer wheel, but it managed to put a nostalgic smile on my face.",,"Ember Lab's very first project is a beautiful adventure set in an even more beautiful universe, and while it's borrowing a lot of its core components from different games of the genre, it still feels fresh and stands on its own. The future surely seems bright both for the franchise and its developer.",,"Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a beautiful game for sure, but it's not just a pretty face to look at: It has engaging gameplay mechanics, great bosses and story and an amazing soundtrack to boot. Ember Labs has delivered us an amazing game and a great addition to the PS5 library.","Kena: Bridge of Spirits has many strengths, but because of that all the flaws tend to stick out even stronger. The lack of polish makes this magical world feel a bit artificial. All that is great about it, truly is amazing. But when you grab the controller itself, you will feel every bump down this 10 hour long road.",,,"Kena: Bridge of Spirits is stunning spectacle full of heart and unbelievable charm. If you aren't carefully selecting hats for your Rot companions by the end, then you're probably made of stone. In the event that your soul is inhospitably frosty, Kena can be deceivingly challenging, throwing boss fights at you that will make those on Demon Souls look like a cake walk. A few minor issues stop Kena from being a showstopper, but there is no doubt that this a great game, and an amazing debut for a 15-person strong team.",,"Kena is a visually appealing adventure with enjoyable gameplay. Although it has its shortcomings, it's a good start as Ember Lab's first game.",Kena: Bridge of Spirits remains traditional in its mechanics while offering a series of surprises that go far beyond the beauty of its world.,"You are constantly haunted by dozens of black ghosts. Your only task is to guide lost souls to the afterlife. Sounds like a scary horror game, doesn't it? But 'Kena: Bridge of spirits' is just the opposite: a beautifully cute yet challenging action-adventure game that is definitely worth a spot on your wish list.","Kena is beautiful, well balanced between combat, puzzle, and platforming, and has some surprisingly challenging bosses. It doesn't reinvent anything, but all that offers works well.",,,"Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a fantastic adventure, one which does an incredible job of mixing platforming elements, fun and energetic combat, a rewarding exploration system and beautiful graphics. It's not only of the best games of 2021, it's one of the best games in recent years.",,"Despite a few shortcomings, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a solid action-adventure game and an impressive debut effort by Ember Lab. It will scratch the itch for anyone looking for a Zelda-like adventure on PlayStation, but while it's been compared to games like Zelda and Pikmin, Kena: Bridge of Spirits still stands on its own. Hopefully, this isn't the end of Kena's story, as it would be great to see the ideas here expanded on in future games.",,"Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a very good game that feels like it’s already been left behind by modern genre conventions. There’s nothing all that frustrating in that - we shouldn’t expect games, especially those made by studios the size of Ember Labs, to be constantly groundbreaking, but so much of Kena feels borrowed from elsewhere that it’s difficult to call it great. It’s a solid, enjoyable experience, and charming enough that you won’t care that you’ve played versions of it before. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it’s a pretty nice wheel nonetheless.",An agreeable adventure that's transformed into something special by its enchanting aesthetic.,,"Kena: Bridge of Spirits is absolutely brilliant. It's one of those rare games that feels like it belongs to the new generation thanks to its magnificent world, and its developers knew exactly how ambitious to be while still providing a top rate experience.",,"Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a completely inoffensive, if somewhat bland adventure that will mildly entertain for the duration of its runtime, but won’t live long in the memory.",,"Ember Lab didn’t try to reinvent the wheel. Instead the developers opted for tried and true mechanics that entertained us time and again in many action adventure games, and mixed them in an almost perfect way. The beginning might be a little slow, but when Kena: Bridge of Spirits gains momentum, it becomes truly great. It’s hard for me to point out any significant flaws apart from overall lack of originality. What a debut! [12/2021, p.74]",,"I wouldn’t call Kena: Bridge of Spirits overly ambitious. More like “strategically ambitious.” Ember Lab avoided biting off more than it could chew with its first game, and I dug it. I hope there’s a sequel! After a much-deserved break, of course.","Kena: Bridge of Spirit’s exceptional visuals clash with its unexceptional gameplay to create a gorgeous experience that would be forgettable if not for its technical prowess. Its combat, puzzles, and platforming are enjoyable but fail to set the world alight, though the adventure is elevated by the beauty of its open world and its highly animated characters.",,"Amazing graphics is one thing, but Bridge of Spirits is so much more thanks to engaging level design and surprisingly deep combat.

[Review in Progress]",,"Every single moment of Kena: Bridge of Spirits is simply wonderful. Very few games are as pleasing to the eyes, and coming from an indie studio – making its very first game, of all things – that's something quite remarkable. Even more remarkable is that Kena isn't simply a visual showcase, either. It's challenging, fun to play, and has a world teeming with life. It also tells a fantastic story, and there's plenty to do even when the credits have rolled. Kena: Bridge of Spirits truly is something special, and I can't wait to see what Ember Lab does next.",,,"Kena: Bridge of Spirits features simple combat and often feels repetitive, but there's plenty of charm that keeps you playing.",,,"""Satisfactory"" is a well suited adjective for this game. It may not be as groundbreaking as other games in the genre, but it offers really interesting exploration and combats. And you'll love your Rots too.","Where Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart took an old formula and brought it into the modern era, Kena: Bridge of Spirits’ approach was more adherent to the old ways. The technical aspects are phenomenal and thoroughly current, but the game itself relies heavily on the old way of doing things. Limited paths. Contrived situational limitations. Collectables galore. You likely already know if that’s something you’re interested in playing, and I personally believe they’ve done an admirable job here. Especially for a first crack.",,"Kena: Bridge of Spirits should take most gamers around 10 to 12 hours to complete, depending on the amount of exploring and the level of difficulty. While the blockbusters games of 2021 continue to deliver the same ho-hum experience of 2021, Kena is a much needed ray of sunshine to the current choices of titles available and more importantly, looks fantastic on the PlayStation 5.",,,,"It's a pity that Kena: Bridge of Spirits did not get a big marketing campaign because it definitely deserves recognition. It's a lovely, well-constructed game for everyone. I really hope we'll see more of Kena in the future, and I wish more debuts like this for every studio.","I’m not sure how Ember Lab did it, but I walked away from Kena: Bridge of Spirits with my expectations surpassed to a much further extent than I could have imagined. The visuals are breathtaking, the gameplay evolves in meaningful ways, and the heart the story contains has no bounds. You’ll find it hard to come across a more wholesome and beautiful game in 2021 than Kena: Bridge of Spirits, it’s everything I wanted it to be and more.","I found Kena: Bridge of Spirits to be one of the best treats of the year, both for the eyes and for the soul. Not only does it show elaborate craftsmanship, but it also feels like it was infused with joy and awareness. I'm happy it's here, and I look forward to seeing where Kena's bridge can lead.","Kena: Bridge of Spirits does little we haven't seen before. Regardless, the game sports small challenges in digestable environmental puzzles, that can be as wonderful as they can be frustrating.",,"As an indie effort and a debut game, Kena: Bridge of Spirits makes a good impression. It balances simplicity and challenge while weaving a neatly-paced story into something that can be played over a chill couple of days. Despite fantastic production values it's still far from a AAA title – so it's important to keep expectations in check, but anyone looking to lose themselves in a charming, gorgeous world ripe for exploration should look no further. It's exactly what I needed right now – perfect cozy weekend entertainment.","Kena: Bridge of Spirits takes us on a whimsical tale that’s both predictable and familiar, but also something brand new with the way that it’s presented. Between the the back and forth moments of polish and unpolished gameplay lays an absolute gem of a game.","Kena: Bridge of Spirits not only looks gorgeous, it additionally delights with challenging combat and simply enjoyable exploration.","After playing a couple of great AAA 3D platformers earlier this year, I'm absolutely blown away that I enjoyed Kena: Bridge of Spirits even more. With thoroughly challenging fast-paced combat, rewarding puzzles, and a breathtaking world; it's one phenomenal game.",,,,"Kena Bridge of Spirits is more than a promising start from Ember Lab. Not only does it shine through its visuals and the presence of those little creatures called Rots, this action and adventure game that looks like an animated film offers an overall experience that is certainly a bit classic, a little young in some aspects, but perfectly condensed to allow both gameplay and storytelling to satisfy players who are looking for a nice trip to take after several periods of lockdown. Magical.","Kena is an enjoyable adventure that mixes familiar elements with the occasional difficulty spike to shake things up. It plays it safe with simplistic combat and an old-school format, but its impressive presentation ultimately lulls you into its world nicely. Its cutscenes tell a story that leaves you curious for more, so here’s hoping that this is just the beginning of great things to come.","This adventure is an absolute joy to experience. It tells an emotional story, looks great and plays well, managing to feel simultaneously fresh and classic. Kena: Bridge of Spirits never reinvents the wheel, but it doesn’t need to. Definitely worth your time and money.",,"Despite borrowing from all manner of modern hits, Kena: Bridge of Spirits just about stands on its own. The wonderful visuals and music leave a strong impression, while the gameplay is simple but enjoyable. If its story went beyond the expected, and one or two small issues were scrubbed away, this would be a real winner. As it is, this is a solid action platformer with lots of personality, and a strong debut from Ember Lab.",,"A beautiful, pleasant adventure game, designed very well, if not very originally. This lack of invention, in addition to a story that’s just not too interesting, keeps Kena from truly shining, but it’s still well worth your time.","Kena: Bridge of Spirits is one of the most charming platform adventures ever, with beautiful environments, characters and a compelling and exciting story. As far as gameplay is concerned, you've played these kinds of games many times before and technically the game isn't perfect, but it's packed in a masterful jacket.",Highly impressive on a technical level but the throwbacks to PS2 era game design feel less like a homage and more an indication of the developers’ lack of experience and imagination.,"For its first attempt, Ember Lab makes quite simply a master stroke. By delivering an ideally successful action-adventure game on all fronts, the studio, however neophyte, is not content to ""just"" perfectly fulfill the specifications of an excellent production. Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a delicious breath of fresh air, which marvelously combines the grace of a sumptuous animated film and the game design intelligence of an ingenious video game, with multiple inspirations. As for Ember Lab, faced with so much mastery of their subject for a first production, it is advisable to take our hat off to them and already wait firmly for their next creation.","Whether you demand more than comfort from your games will inform the way you see Kena: Bridge of Spirits; is it merely a graphically sumptuous example of design that you wish we would leave behind, or is it a vivifying tribute to a rich precursor legacy?","Ember Labs has established a solid foundation for a franchise that could eventually rival The Legend of Zelda. If future entries refine the combat and platforming, this could become one of the defining new series of this console generation.",It’s pretty amazing to think that Kena: Bridge of Spirits is Ember Lab’s very first game. With absolutely stunning visuals and impactful music this is sure to leave an impression on people. Gameplay-wise it doesn’t do anything particularly new or innovative but that doesn’t stop it from being loads of fun. This is a small adventure with enough challenge and heart to keep you entertained for the full 10–15 hours that it’ll take for you to reach its conclusion.,"Kena Bridge of Spirits may truly excel when it comes to a beautifully designed world and its gorgeous visuals and animation, but it can all feel relatively familiar, featuring platforming and combat mechanics that we’ve seen time and time again. Despite this, Ember Lab has created an action-adventure that can be enjoyed by players of all ages, weaving together Kena’s magical abilities, fantastic enemy designs, and a myriad of collectibles to uncover. Wherever the studio decides to take their next adventure, I’m excited to see it — hopefully with the return of The Rot.","Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a majestic adventure in a world that blends life and death in a one-of-a-kind path of forgiveness and redemption.

Everything fits together perfectly thanks to a level design and a game structure that does not tire, because it knows how to give variety and style.

If it does well - and given the fever with which it's been followed leading up to its release, I expect it will - it'll be because we often value AAA looks and mechanics more highly than attempts at innovation. I'm sure with this foundation Ember Lab has a great game in it, but this isn't it just yet.",,"As a story, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a warning about grief and the damage it can do to ourselves, our loved ones and the world around us. It’s a message about letting go and respecting the need for change, something I’m deeply keen to see from Ember Lab. Kena shows enough promise and reverence for some of the biggest third-person games. But what will be truly special is when the studio moves past that to craft more of their own identity. The studio has an abundance of promise and talent.

The magic of Bridge of Spirits is all here: in its sweet magnetism, in its balance between gameplay and storytelling, in the echo of those adventure games of yesteryear, where simplicity moved hand in hand with refinement. Gorgeous to look at and rewarding to play, Kena is a debut work that has rarely been seen in recent years: that the independent sector can be guided by its spirit.",Kena: Bridge of Spirits is an astonishing action-adventure with a unique art direction. It proposes brilliant puzzle-platform sections and let the player be free to explore and manage the pace with their own rhythm.,,,"With its Pixar-like characters and beyond stunning animation, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is as charming as it is dark with plenty of surprises that will not only keep players enthralled for hours but also captivate their hearts.",,"A stunningly beautiful 3D action-adventure that combines environmental puzzles, exploration and Dark Souls-like (both in implementation and challenge) combat.",,"Kena: Bridge of Spirits is the game that was missing to end 2021 in the best way possible. This title pictures a reality not far from ours, where the corruption is imminent and the salvation of the land demands a path that challenge us and makes us grow into a better version of ourselves. As a Spirit Guide, Kena took the compromise of freeing every soul that needed her. She felt fear, failed to have decisions but with the help of her Rot friends she was able to accomplish her mission, in which is the perfect balance between duty and passion.",,,"With its elegantly simple combat and beautiful world, Kena: Bridge of Spirits harkens back to the days of the N64/GameCube-era Zeldas, Okami, and Star Fox Adventures, while also adding modern sensibilities and a distinct personal touch.",,,"Kena: Bridge Of Spirits might draw upon some aged influences, but the way it assembles the various pieces of the puzzle together makes it feel very modern indeed.",,,,"Bridge of Spirits tackles the question of whether a game is worthwhile if it doesn’t innovate, and the answer is yes. Ember Lab’s biggest sin with Kena is just not following up on the unique identity hinted at throughout the journey, but never developed fully. That aside, Bridge of Spirits is still a rich and beautiful adventure with smart combat and superb platforming, and hopefully, it's not the last we hear from Ember Lab.","I felt enamored with Kena: Bridge of Spirits throughout the entirety of its gorgeous adventure, but its gameplay and exploration doesn’t fully match the high expectations set by its stunning visuals. It’s got some solid combat that has just the right amount of challenge, some clever puzzles itching to be solved and plenty of nooks and crannies to explore. But the rewards for curious exploration aren’t always that exciting, and I wish I’d had more time getting to know the likeable Kena herself before the credits rolled. Still, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a captivating and well-made affair with a big heart, and will surely scratch an itch for many gamers keen on taking part in a touching journey through one of the prettiest worlds ever created.",,,,,,,"Kena: Bridge of Spirits is an excellent debut. Even if the story ends a bit in the background, the beauty of the world, the animations and the combat system make the adventure of Kena and his friends Rot's truly memorable.",,"Bridge of Spirits stumbles a little in spots, yet confidently sprints into the heart of the adventure, rewarding the player with secrets galore and visuals that are almost always worth admiring. If you love Zelda-like games or are just looking for an experience that will make you smile every step of the way, you can’t go wrong with Kena: Bridge of Spirits.",,,"Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a solid game that hearkens back to titles of the sixth generation of games, with a coat of paint indicative of modern gaming that should appease younger players while offering enough gameplay variety for anyone to enjoy.",,,,"I’ve mentioned a lot of other games throughout this review. Uncharted, Jak & Daxter, Pikmin, I could name a few more too. While not a lot here is fully original, almost everything is well-executed, and when you add an excellent story and a ton of personality, you have a winning experience. While there are a few minor issues here and there, Kena: Bridge of Spirits provides a wonderful base that we can only hope future games will build on.",,,,Kena: Bridge of Spirits is an excellent debut game from developer Ember Lab. Pulling from legendary franchises like Pikmin and God of War — with a splash of Ori and the Blind Forest for good measure — Kena manages to balance a compelling story with engaging gameplay and a charming art direction to create a worthwhile adventure.,The story depicted in Kena is forgettable. But the journey to get there is absolutely not. Ember Labs gift us an artistic vision and an OST that are both splendid! The structure of the game is quiet classic and sometimes feels like routine but the fighting mechanics are incredible and the pleasure is undeniably there.,"Boss battles aside, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a remarkable first effort from Ember Lab that showcases their amazing potential. They’ve crafted a beautiful world and touching story that really highlight the strength of their writing and animation capabilities, and the soundtrack is captivating. While Kena provides engaging activities as you explore, the inexperience with combat clearly shows. Kena serves as a strong foundation for Ember Lab to build upon, and it’s clear that given more experience they’re capable of great things to come.",,"Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a magical journey, one that I hope everyone will take.","Telling a number of touching tales of loss and love, Kena is a visually stunning action-platformer that feels like a classic PS2 game in mostly the right ways.","The act of meeting and understanding all those other characters is powerful, though. Kena: Bridge of Spirits is ultimately a game about making those connections, just like it's about making a connection with the game world around you through the Rot. It centers on characters who tried valiantly but failed to help one another, and what dealing with that pain did to them. It's about exploring a world and seeing what it once was, and helping to restore it again. And while Kena: Bridge of Spirits is full of familiar-feeling combat and exploration, its ability to find different ways to look at those ideas makes for a beautiful, emotional, and exciting journey.","It’s not that it plays like a game from a different time, the overall design and flow is both time-worn and engaging -- it’s just that in certain areas it begins to feel a little disconnected. Secrets and treasure mostly come in the form of cute little hats for your Rot and the blue-crystal currency to buy more hats. So, the incentive to explore isn’t really there from a thematic or discovery context. We wish there was more finding spirits and restoring the village stuff as opposed to chests bursting open with a currency you never feel like you actually need.","Kena might not be perfect, but it's far from what one might expect from a studio's first game. It's a spectacle to look at without being too long or too short, and it's one of the rare examples of a game that deserves a movie adaptation, not the other way around. Perhaps more than anything else, it's a game that sets the bar high for whatever Ember Lab wants to do next.",,"Kena Bridge of Spirits is a magical adventure, even if it doesn't do anything entirely original. Its elements tie together well, and it's jaw-droppingly gorgeous on PS5. It hearkens back to the days of PS2 platformers in all the best ways, and despite a few small issues, it stands out as one of 2021's best titles.","A good first attempt by a studio that has only worked on animation, but not enough substance in the gameplay to keep you hooked to the very end.","As a debut game, Kena: Bridge Of Spirits excels with its cinematic visuals and polished gameplay that feels like a calling card for Ember Lab to be acquired by Sony if it was to revive its colourful mascot action-adventure platformers of old. However, it’s lacking its own personality and ideas while its lacklustre story means your feelings and memories of it will quickly move into the next world the moment you’re done with it.","Kena: Bridge of Spirits is the finest adventure game released in years and a clear highlight of the latest console cycle. Both its exploration and combat components gradually build in complexity with tools that always have a clear purpose. That elegant mechanical design keeps the focus on the game’s impactful story, which tells an aching, but hopeful tale of environmental disaster. There are a lot of points of comparisons to be made when breaking it all down, but Kena: Bridge of Spirits blends every little influence together into its own gorgeous mix.",,,,,"Kena is a playful and beautiful adventure, but it does not bring any breathtaking innovation. But it has the potential to take you to a fairy tale and let you experience the story of a young girl, which is a balanced experience.",,"Despite featuring a very familiar experience inspired by The Legend of Zelda series, Kena: Bridge of Spirits manages to stand out from the competition with its amazing visuals, excellent combat system, and puzzle design. The underwhelming story and lack of real innovation prevent the game from being a must-have, sure, but what Kena: Bridge of Spirits does well, it really does well, so much that it's very easy to look past its issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
toem,,,,,,,,Toem is a frequent delight with a wonderful photo mechanic and excellent music. Just a shame it's not longer. It's pretty great though. Get to it.,,,,,"Brilliantly simple and beautifully stripped back, TOEM is what an indie game should be. It's different, a palette-cleanser if you will and takes me back to where games were just fun. No grinding, no monthly online events, just find this bloke's cat and take a photo of it. There's beauty here in the pure simplicity. TOEM runs well, plays great, and most people will find joy within its black and white walls.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"What sets TOEM apart from the many other wholesome games that plateau at mediocrity is its excellent execution of the concepts it puts forth. There is no design here that is questionable, no idea that feels unfinished. This is simply a well-crafted jaunt through a charming world. And it’s one that beckons me to return long after I’ve done everything I can possibly do in the game just to see what other amusing pictures I can take.",,,,,,"It may be short, but TOEM delivers heart by the truckload. This gorgeous hand-drawn adventure will have you fully invested in its quaint little world, taking photos of everything you see – whether it’s for a mission or just for the sheer joy of it. It’s the sort of game that makes the world seem like a better place – even if only for a few hours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"On all levels, Toem feels like an homage of sorts to the early days of Nintendo. Through the game itself, it pays respects to Pokémon, while every facet of the presentation feels like a classic touchstone, from the hand-drawn aesthetic to the inaudible warble of the world’s creatures. It’s familiar, accessible and it sets a fun, quirky tone that’ll please anyone who gives it the time.",,,,,,,,,,,"It's a very simple game that you can easily wrap up over a weekend, but it's a satisfying, imaginative, and endlessly pleasant adventure while it lasts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Each area, from a forest dwelling to the city to a seaside port, is friendly and fun to explore. Even ghosts just require a little help to move on.2 Conflict comes in the form of problems that everyone is happy to collaborate on fixing. Solutions usually involve your camera in unusual ways, such as directing a lighthouse with your zoom during a storm. It’s a journey you’ll remember, and by the end, you’ll have a camera roll full of memories to look back at. [Issue#7, p.78]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Like each of the hundred or more photos you’re likely to take in one playthrough, Toem is exactly what it appears to be: an eye-catching but short adventure about exploring and puzzle-solving. Your photo targets range from loud and obvious to near-invisible, so everyone should find something fun to hunt. The textures don’t always hold up from every angle, and the trip ends far too soon, but there are definitely memories here worth keeping.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only some issues about control and difficulty keep it from excellence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Torch City is really impressive. Every district has its own unique style and all the environments are extraordinarily detailed. The game’s atmosphere is fantastic, exploring the wonderfully designed world is very engaging and the combat system is great.

While some of its elements will be over-familiar to genre fans, the originalities still shine through, resulting in a brilliant-looking, great-playing metroidvania that will delight players, whether they have a fluffy tail or otherwise. Heed my words: It’s most definitely wabbit season.",,"F.I.S.T .: Forged In Shadow Torch combines a beautiful world full of anthropomorphic animals, stunning locations, great music, deep combos and fun exploration, but at the same time shows problems with uneven difficulty levels and unbalanced combat system.",,,,"The odd gameplay issue aside, F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch is one of the most enjoyable Metroidvanias you can play right now. While you probably won’t care about its story, it’s easy to fall in love with the game’s detailed world and somewhat cute characters. It’s the thrilling combat and raft of collectibles and upgrades to find that will have you going back to it time and time again, however, keen to make Rayton the powerful hero he’s destined to be.",,,"F.I.S.T: Forged in Shadow Torch's exciting, brutal combat, and rewarding exploration set it apart from many of its genre-mates, and make it utterly worth your time.",,,,"F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch is an exceptional game.

Perfectly paced and with plenty of surprises, TiGames has created something special that is a must for fans of the genre.",,,,,,,"F.I.S.T. Forged in Shadow Torch features complex combat, a huge and incredibly detailed map to explore, loads of secrets to find, a lengthy campaign, and gorgeous visuals. While I may have had a few minor gripes and do wish there was less required backtracking, I had loads of fun chasing down The Legion and its Iron Dogs and unraveling the mystery of the spark. F.I.S.T. is a must play for fans of the metroidvania genre.",,,,"F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow is a very competent, very good-looking foray into the Metroidvania genre with solid platforming and exciting, demanding arcade combat. Torch City is a wonderfully-grim place to get lost in and it's rendered gorgeously, despite some awkward signposting at times. Most of all, it nails the sense of exploration and steady progress that's a hallmark of the genre and it does all of that with a kick-arse rabbit in a mech suit for a protagonist. If this is the level of quality that studios backed by the China Hero Project are going to deliver then the program has more than made a case for itself.",,"A consistent, challenging and exciting dieselpunk Metroidvania in which a bunny smashes robots to pieces. What more could you want?",,,,,,,,,"F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch is a stellar Metroidvania adventure set in a beautifully realised world, replete with challenging combat encounters, rewarding exploration, and some spicy platforming action.

Its gameplay, at the beginning screwed to the ground, constantly gains in depth and becomes more and more aerial, and its universe, alive and coherent, offers varied and inspired landscapes. Between a jazz club, a remote village in snow-capped mountains and the streets of a retro-futuristic dieselpunk town, the title of TiGames is a constant invitation to travel. In other words, we warmly recommend F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch which presents itself as the little surprise of this new school year.",,,"While it may not redefine the Metroidvania style of games by any stretch of the imagination, F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch is a stellar example of the genre done right.

As long as you don’t mind an occasional table flip encounter here and there, this is a hare-raising adventure for the ages.",,"F.I.S.T. Forged in Shadow Torch is a remarkable game for such a young development team; however, it suffers from various balance problems, mitigated only in part by the introduction of an Easy Mode, as well as by a narrative rhythm that is not always at its best... but, without a doubt, it's an highly recommended purchase for alle the lovers of the metroidvania genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,F.I.S.T. Forged in Shadow Torch is a must-buy for Metroidvania fans looking for something that tries new things. It takes the well-worn staples of the sub-genre and blends them with a steampunk feel and a richer storyline than most.,,"Maybe not the best metroidvania, but a strong contender. Great graphics, a lot of personality and fun, F.I.S.T. is one of those games that deserve your time if you like the genre.",,,"F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch is a gorgeous Metroidvania that tells a much better story than any anthropomorphic narrative has a right to tell. It's emotional and engaging during each scene brought together with challenging moments of action and puzzle-platforming. This game respects your time, but some moments can drag on due to limited fast travel and some confusing objectives. Who cares though, you're a rabbit with a robotic fist attached to your back; how cool is that!?","As a Metroidvania, F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch has achieved the point of ""making players feel comfortable"". Even if you are not a fan of this type of game, its comfortable controlling feel, brilliant gameplay and moderate difficulty are still worth to try.","FIST is a by-the-numbers Metroidvania, elevated by its cast of anthro characters and its deep and interesting dieselpunk world. However, this doesn’t distract enough to forgive its unbalanced combat, very standard level design and a lot of back-tracking.","Aside from rigid combat and some visual hiccups, F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch delivers a unique world with an intriguing narrative and tight traversal.","Everything about this title is a joy and great, engaging gameplay is complimented by a beautiful world that springs to life on the PS5 both visually in its setting as well as its characters and stories. Top this off with a great protagonist and you have a game of the year contender in every respect. Metroid Dread? Who needs it.","F.I.S.T .: Forged In Shadow Torch is a game that will delight metroidvania enthusiasts, while guaranteeing sufficient originality in the design to create its own identity.","F.I.S.T .: Forged in Shadow Torch is an imperfect production but by no means trivial: a metroidvania that does its own without excelling in any area, in any case denoting a certain expertise on the part of a team that is anything but accustomed to global stages. What is missing are only a bit of an overall vision, a sense of proportion (because the adventure is paradoxically even a thread too long) and a basic balance: sins of youth, however excusable, which cannot really affect the value of a title that can be played with a certain pleasure.",,,,,,"The level design in F.I.S.T. belongs to these excellent metroidvania games where there is just pure joy in exploration. The developer has great knowledge on what makes the genre tick, but at the same time they seem to be a bit “shy” when it comes to any form of innovative idea that would truly make them excel. Nevertheless, this is a must for fans of metroidvanias.",,,,,,,,"While the boss fights can be frustrating, F.I.S.T. is a solid entry in the Metroidvania genre. Anyone that enjoys these types of games should definitely experience what it has to offer.",,,"F.I.S.T: Forged in Shadow Torch is an excellent offering that is surprisingly getting very little marketing at launch. With a great aesthetic, an engaging enough narrative, together with challenging combat and rewarding Metroidvania exploration, this is one resistance movement everyone should be signing on for.",,,,,,,,,"A metroidvania full of explorable areas, with a good combat system, but unable to stand out or say its very own.","F.I.S.T. is a very solid metroidvania, with a neat universe and fights that keep you glued to the pad. Rather difficult and rich enough in content, TiGames' soft only suffers from a few clumsinesses, such as regularly misplaced checkpoints or a few lunar collisions, but nothing that can really spoil the pleasure of playing.","F.I.S.T. offers another fine example of an exploration-focused side-scroller, and fans of the genre will find plenty to love. What it lacks in innovation, it makes up for by executing familiar ideas at a high level and dropping them into an alluring world.

If you’re up for the challenge and willing to deal with these issues, there’s definitely a good time to be had.",,,"With its interesting Dieselpunk world and gameplay that successfully reflects the characteristics of the genre, it is a game that Metroidvania lovers should not miss.

Still the exploration is second-to-none. I wish the combat was more fluid or the enemy encounters tweaked a bit better. I feel like most people will quickly fall off once the difficulty ramps up. It is not hard due to challenge, but more because of functionality and that sucks. It tarnishes an otherwise incredible experience that could have easily been the next huge series in the genre. Still if you can muster through the challenge this is an experience worth taking.",,,,,,,,,,,"F.I.S.T. Forged in Shadow Torch throws a lot of different things at the wall and tries to make them all stick.

marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy,Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is blissfully freeing in a way that not many shooters are these days.,"I suppose we can now venture into the old “is Guardians worth $60?” debate. If you miss hyper linear story games with no live service BS, and are a big Marvel fan, then this might be the game for you. If you are hoping for Devil May Cry level combat and God of War type puzzles and exploration within a linear story, you will be disappointed. But I can safely say this is probably a better end product than most people were expecting, and that alone is a pretty big win for a game that felt like a bit of a risk and like it’s been lacking in buzz leading up to launch here. It has issues, but it gets a lot right, and pushes storytelling in ways I haven’t seen in this genre before.",,"Guardians keeps you strapped in for the ride, and while it does dip once too often, the emotional highs outweigh the patience-testing lows. [Issue#366, p.108]","It’s been a rocky road for Marvel properties in videogames, but Guardians of the Galaxy stands out as one of the very best. The combination of likable characters and fantastic scenery make for a game that’s an absolute blast to play for the entire duration. It’s got great style and a big heart, and really, that’s kinda what Guardians of the Galaxy as a franchise is all about. Eidos Montreal should be congratulated on an excellent adventure, and Square-Enix should be commended for letting them make it while locking the upselling bean counters in a broom closet.",,"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy has its flaws, but it's probably one of the best games in the Marvel universe beside Insomniac's Spider-Man in recent years.",,,"Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. I’ve had zero expectations for this game since the preview trailers were so boring and bland, but the game itself is a whole different story. The amazing script was brought to life with excellent voice acting and all stuffed into some incredible and fun gameplay with captivating characters, quips, jokes and set pieces. Gardeners of the Galaxy is now a contender on my GOTY list.","This take on Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy puts a premium on character and storytelling, with surprisingly impressive results.","Add in absolutely stunning visuals, and you have one of the finest adventure games of 2021. Guardians of the Galaxy is everything you could want in a Marvel video game, really, filled with a blend of electric moments and thoughtful junctures.","Eidos Montreal has crafted one of the best superhero games. Their attention to world-building and characterization should be followed by many studios to come. Exciting combat that blends action RPG elements with strategic player commands and breathtaking visuals and animations is something to behold. But what truly sets this title apart is the fantastic writing, not just for the Guardians themselves but for every character you come across. If you weren't a fan of the franchise before, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy might just change your mind.","Guardians of the Galaxy shines when it focuses on the characters and the world around them. It might not be the most innovative game this year, but it excellently executes the tried-and-true linear action-adventure formula to deliver a great single-player experience.","Guardians of the Galaxy offers a great gaming experience: fun story, good combat, good characterization and well done VA.","Eidos Montréal gives us one of the most interesting narrative games of recent times, always taking advantage of the medium's own tools to narrate. Knowledge and affection for the characters, entertaining combat, incessant surprises... one of the best of the year.","The story is entertaining, and it features characters from the Marvel universe that haven't yet surfaced in the movies, such as Fin Fang Foom, Lady Hellbender and the Nova Corps. Add in the requisite humor and self-deprecation and an eclectic killer soundtrack, and you get one of the most enjoyable games of the year.",Blasting combat gameplay that merges very well with the single player concept without loosing the sense of being part of a team. Humor and drama draws an engaging story very focused on The Guardians of the Galaxy.,,"It’s not quite up there with the PS5’s superlative Spider-Man Marvel game, that’s another level of awesome. But there’s plenty of old-school singleplayer adventure here to get you through those chilly Autumn nights until the next big Marvel movie hits the silver screen.","Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is such a redemption after the disaster with Marvel's Avengers. Amazing gameplay, great story and stunning graphics, are some elements that makes the new Eidos game a must-have.","I’m a simple man (not in game), give me a comic interpretation made by people who appreciate and understand the source material and tell a captivating story and you’ve got me hooked. There’s not much to do outside of the bit of collectibles and costumes after you beat the game but maybe if Guardians does well enough we’ll see some strong DLC content. Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is built to be a holiday season blockbuster (I mean is anything else even coming out this holiday?), and all of its accessibility options make it the perfect gift for anyone.",,"Guardians of the Galaxy is a strong contender for Game of the Year in 2021. Constantly, the game surprises with its inventive use of the Marvel formula. Eidos-Montreal has managed to do the impossible, creating a vision for the Guardians that isn’t beholden to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and can stand on its own. Featuring rich dialog and a character- and personality-driven story, players will be able to forge their own path as Star-Lord, leading his ragtag group of miscreants across the universe. Combat may not offer many surprises but is explosive and fast-paced enough to allow for exciting tactical teamwork. Guardians of the Galaxy has set a new standard for games based on comics and while there may be competition in the future, this game proves the genre can evolve to new heights.","Eidos-Montreal’s Guardians of the Galaxy is brilliant, but the one thing holding me back from giving it a higher score is how dated many of its conventions seem. The power cooldown has no plan B, QTEs are everywhere, and again… Eagle Vision. It’s a few years behind the times, even without George Michael's dulcet tones. It’s fun, but it certainly isn’t fresh, and for a lot of people, that will be enough. In some ways, it's an experience not to be missed. In others, it's an experience you've had before.","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy tells an utterly memorable story, with brilliant takes on the Guardians themselves, even if the gameplay could be more adventurous at times.",,,,,"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is the purest form of chaos; but also of good storytelling. It is a journey, not with mere NPCs alongside Peter Quill, but with real friends. It is also a full display of crazy explosions, action to get your blood pumping, hilarious jokes and sublime music. All in all, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the best single-player experiences of 2021.",,"Guardians of the Galaxy is a spectacular, albeit lengthy adventure with enjoyable mechanics and a surprisingly deeper story than what is on the surface.","Guardians of the Galaxy coasts by quite a bit on personality, and that's definitely going to make it divisive.","Guardians of the Galaxy is a solid original story from Eidos Montreal that deviates from both the MCU and the comics, providing something for Marvel fans across mediums to enjoy. However, while it’s certainly a step up from publisher Square Enix’s Avengers, it suffers with its own notable bugs and glitches that detract from the on-screen action. The day one patch will hopefully tackle these problems, and if so this is a highly recommendable superhero game that doesn’t quite step it up like Insomniac’s Spider-Man series, though still does right by its unlikely group of misfit anti-heroes.","Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is an excellent story-driven game with compelling characters, nice humor, great narrative and amazing visuals.","Clever writing, fun gameplay and a deeply charming cast of characters goes a long way, but Guardians of the Galaxy is otherwise a tad too long, too noisy and too unpolished.",,,"It’s hard not to love Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. Yes, I wish there was more scope for open exploration, and I wish some of the combat encounters were a little more varied. But there’s a ridiculous amount of heart here. From an absolutely killer soundtrack to brilliantly-written characters that you can’t help but adore, it’s a rip-roaring adventure through space that left me wanting more. Ultimately, it’s one of Marvel’s best video game outings yet.","Guardians of the Galaxy sets a new high bar for interactive storytelling and jaw-dropping visuals. With an unparalleled attention to detail, Guardians tells a rollicking sci-fi story rooted in true human emotion. But the gameplay sections of this narrative masterpiece sometimes bog down the proceedings with merely ""okay"" combat and exploration.",,"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a bit rough around the edges, but it's so fun to play, with a well-written and exciting story.","Simplistic, repetitive interactions drag on an otherwise engaging story based on the Marvel franchise.","Despite a few technical hiccups, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of 2021's best games thanks to a fantastic story with amazing gameplay to boot. These Guardians really stand out from the movies even though they might similar. In many ways, Eidos has created Uncharted in space but with deeply satisfying combat mechanics that keep you entertained throughout.","Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a solid action adventure that fans of this group of heroes will love. Although it is not surprising in its approach, it does many things well and manages to redeem itself in the eyes of lovers of the Marvel universe.","Although over the decades comics have become ever more reflective of the complexities and concerns of contemporary life, in the end, they are still often the literary or cinematic equivalent of fast food: momentarily delicious, exactly what you need to fill the void, but not necessarily memorable or nutritious. Guardians of the Galaxy isn’t afraid of touching on some weighty themes, but they’re always secondary to an absorbing story, entertaining characters, and engaging action. Guardians of the Galaxy isn’t perfect, but overall, it’s a very effective translation of Marvel’s iconic band of misfits from page or screen into interactive entertainment.","Marvel's: Guardians of the Galaxy is a fantastic game. He knows what his greatest virtues are and he performs them without showing off. Square Enix has found a path that it can and must explore, using the most popular and interactive medium, to shape its comic book universe wherever it can.","Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy aims high and hits the target perfectly by delivering a thoroughly enjoyable single-player action RPG as you control Star Lord and his his motley alien crew while kicking ass along the way. It’s immaculately presented on the PlayStation 5 with graphics that pop and a soundtrack that will even make director James Gunn envious! So if you’re looking for the perfect alien superhero getaway, Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy hits that bullseye perfectly.",,,,"Guardians of the Galaxy vs. Avengers? The latter doesn't stand a chance. On the one hand, I should encourage you to buy GotG and send a clear message to the overlords that gamers still love single-player stories. On the other hand, I wish Eidos had spent this time making a third Deus Ex. Still, I had tons of fun with the Guardians, and I'd like to see a sequel.","Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is the biggest surprise of the year, and joins Marvel’s Spider-Man as one of the best Marvel video games in the last decade. The Guardians themselves steal the show, depicted perfectly, with a movie/comic-worthy story that will leave you laughing and crying. The combat is a lot of fun with plenty of strategies to use, even if it can get a little repetitive, and the setting and locations blow you away in scale and how incredibly detailed and beautiful they are. This Guardians team absolutely stands on its own, and just like the movie I’m hooked on a feeling.","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is an extremely fun little romp that is genuinely funny and heartfelt. It's fun to play, and combat maintains the feel of a team working together despite being technically only a single-player game. The only real downside is that it is a linear game, so the replay value depends on how much you enjoy seeing alternate outcomes to various cut scenes. If you're a fan of the franchise and don't mind that this doesn't matching the MCU version, then there's a whole lot to like in MGotG.","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is primarily filled with hilarity. The dialogue is expertly written, which fleshes out the characters like never before. The dynamic that this creates between the titular Guardians is more than enough to keep you chained to your screen for upwards of 20 hours.","Marvel’s Guardians Of The Galaxy is more than pleasant surprise. Even when its combat system doesn't shine, everything is saved by a completely charming story and cast.","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is pure blockbuster entertainment in much the same way as the MCU films. It might not push any boundaries in the genre, but it's a damned good Guardians game with a ton of heart and a clear passion for the property that shows. Eidos Montreal has clearly understood the strengths of its team and how they fit in with what fans love about the franchise to make the right calls. The result is an enjoyable ride and the most Marvel Marvel game around.","Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun-filled cosmic adventure. No aggressive microtransactions, no tacked on multiplayer, just a good ol’ fashioned single-player adventure with MCU-worthy blockbuster sequences and heartfelt story moments. The combat offers just enough variance and depth to remain entertaining throughout your playthrough but the magic truly resides within the colorful cast of characters.",Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy provides a fun action adventure with small gameplay weaknesses for fans.,"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy leaves an outstanding first impression but after playing it for a handful of hours, you'll realise that it doesn't really offer enough exciting gameplay to last its entire campaign. It's still a wonderful game to watch, though.",,,"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a good superhero game. It may not be the best out there, but it is in the top 5. If you are a true Marvel fan familiar with the Guardians of the Galaxy universe it hits the perfect notes in almost perfect order. It tried to balance the videogames gameplay with a cinematic experience, focusing on delivering a quality single player experience. It does not miss the multiplayer or co-op experience at all, and you can feel that it was made with care. Guardians of the Galaxy makes us forget about the grindy gameplay of Avengers and proves that Square Enix can deliver an engaging experience.",Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun trip across the galaxy alongside comics' most famous motley crew. Eidos Montreal totally nailed the tone of this one and it's a pleasure to watch and hear the team evolve over time. The game's dialogue is very well written with some genuinely funny lines (and great voice acting). All the while telling a touching story. We just wish the game's combat would have been a bit more inspired and polished.,"With a solid script, robust soundtrack, and plethora of expertly delivered lines, it’s obvious a lot of care was put into making Guardians of the Galaxy feel like you were playing through an interactive movie. Its gameplay choices won’t win any awards, but the magic it makes with its witty lines and casual banter succeed in inviting you into its strange, goofy, and striking world.","Marvel's Guardian of the Galaxy brings you a fun entertaining adventure, where the emphasis is on the development of the various characters. This can be called successful and the gameplay plays both with exploration, which is very nice, and with combat. This is somewhat limited however, because the game lacks depth in terms of combat. Graphically it is also not perfect, but it must be said that visually it looks very neat thanks to the artistic style. This makes Guardians of the Galaxy a successful game that is definitely worth it for Marvel fans.","Guardians of the Galaxy is a competent, if not especially electrifying, action game that sails along on the back of strong voice acting and the sheer momentum with which it introduces new scenes and charismatic characters.","For as much uncertainty there has been surrounding Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, the final game has delivered. Fun and frantic combat provide the basis for a long, extremely enjoyable campaign featuring the characters you love and the tracks your kids usually screw their noses up at. A great title that deserves to be expanded upon in the future.","Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun game, very well-planned, with great narrative and strong ambitions to entertain the player. Star-Lord's interaction with the Milano crew and the rest of the characters is magical. Combat and physics can be problematic, but the errors don't overshadow the positives. Even the Latin American dubbing is a delight that you are sure to enjoy.","Forget the action set-pieces, forget the puzzles - the main draw of this sci-fi adventure is the irresistible chemistry between the main heroes. The story drives everything forward - and since it’s a very good story, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a very good game with a brilliant soundtrack to boot.",,"A surprisingly ambitious cosmic space adventure that excels the more it diverges from the movies, offering robust action, impressive visuals, and unexpectedly sophisticated storytelling.","With its endearing characters and effective humor, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the pleasant surprises of the end of the year, which is obviously aimed at a very large audience. Behind this careful writing, we feel a deep love on the part of the developers of Eidos Montreal for its marginalized space. And if the adventure is not as epic as we hoped, the journey is nonetheless pleasant with its moments of complicity and the many choices offered which reinforce the player's involvement. A truly attractive journey, in particular thanks to an efficient and fluid combat system which nevertheless shows its limits at the end of the game and against the bosses. Finally, it is more on its visual part that the title can divide. If we find on the one hand original environments and neat character models, we also note the presence of less convincing facial animations in places and sometimes less fine landscapes. It is nonetheless a gripping adventure alongside the galaxy's greatest magnificent losers that has plenty to please MCU fans.","Where Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy proves most winsome, however, is in its twining of the intergalactic and the terrestrial.","If Guardians of the Galaxy had Returnal’s combat and traversal, it would be a real Game of the Year contender, but it’s the few mechanical flaws that hold it back.","Despite some initial skepticism that they could pull it off, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is everything I want a Guardians of the Galaxy game to be. It is character-focused first and foremost, retaining the comedic heart and ’80s vibe that is core to the franchise. As a single-player game, it doesn’t get bogged down by expectations of some kind of grind or endgame. While combat can sometimes be rather chaotic and there are a few bugs, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy understands what Guardians of the Galaxy is—character, comedy, and heart.","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy delivers superhero thrills and genuine heart with an engrossing story, lovable characters, and fun (if predictable), gameplay...Despite control issues and occasionally holding it back, Eidos-Montréal crafted a game that prevails more than it falters. While it doesn’t break any new ground, like some of the MCU's entries, it still feels like time well spent with its characters.","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is simply one of the most satisfying superhero action/adventure games we've played recently. A great story, hilarious gameplay and excellent technical achievement make the new work of Eidos Montréal one of the best games of the year.",,"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy offers some great dialogue, strong characters and occasionally interesting story choices. The gameplay is serviceable, and it could have used a bit more polish, but it's being in the company of these self-proclaimed good guys that you'll be most interested in.",,,"It gets the tone and characters right enough that Marvel-heads will want to see this story 6 through, but make someone else play it while you munch popcorn. [Issue#8, p.78]","It could be difficult to make a Guardians of the Galaxy video game, but Eidos Montreal has managed to keep up in terms of playability, music and visuals. One of the greatest Marvel's video games [Recommended].",,"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is enjoyable enough at times, but weighed down by a deluge of unnecessary systems and bullet-sponge combat.",,"Just like the titular scrappy band of underdogs, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy defied all of my expectations. What I expected to be an awkward mishandling of one of Marvel’s most unlikely superhero teams turned out to be one of the most faithful and entertaining depictions of the Guardians since their 2014 movie debut, and one of my favorite games of 2021.",Guardians of the Galaxy by Eidos Montreal ends up becoming an even better Guardians story than the two blockbuster films combined.,I always expected to jet around blasting aliens in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. But its new place as one of the more emotionally resonant video game stories in recent memory easily makes it 2021’s best surprise. [Polygon Recommends],"It turns out that Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy shouldn’t have been written off. Eidos Montreal delivers a strong story filled with comedy and tragedy, great characters and a world that feels entirely unlike the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They’ve compiled a lengthy adventure that’ll take players to new and familiar locations and built out a great gameplay system that utilizes all the Guardians’ best attributes.","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy takes the action RPG and draws from both the films and comics to create a stunning gaming experience. With plenty of humor, an amazing soundtrack, and stellar gameplay, this is one of the best team-based comic book games ever.",,"Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy absolutely nails the vibe and look, even if the middling story, technical issues, and repetition hold it back from being truly great.","Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a great portrayal of the space-faring heroes and a good game. We encountered some annoying bugs that are hopefully alleviated with patches, and it's pretty linear, but this is an interstellar romp that you can enjoy across a few evenings.","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a damn great, roughly 30-hour experience that anyone can enjoy regardless of their history with any content from Marvel's extensive catalog. While combat can be effortless, it's rarely dull with clear effort poured into every imaginable corner. Character scenes are full of fun moments of dialogue but still manage to feature some emotional story beats enhanced by the cast. Looking past my critiques, I had a joyous time with Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, and I hope it gets the praise it deserves.",,,"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy might be by-the-numbers, but it's a consistently enjoyable experience with great characters and an engaging story, thanks to an excellent understanding of what makes this property tick.",,"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is exactly what a fan would want from a Guardians of the Galaxy tie-in. In the game you can only control Star-Lord, but the adventure developed by Eidos Montreal boasts a brilliant script, which effectively exploits the dynamics that made the movies so successful.","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy gave us positive vibes from the moment we set foot on Milan. A solid gunplay, the importance assigned to the cooperation between the protagonists and the phenomenal script lead us to widely approve Eidos Montréal's fresh and original vision of the precious license of the House of Ideas. However, there are some reserves of a technical and playful nature, accompanied by a fairly limited level of customization. Whether or not you are a die-hard fan of the most ramshackle supergroup in the Multiverse, let yourself be enchanted by the extravagant style and personalities of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and set off with them for the stars.",,,,"Guardians of the Galaxy is everything that Marvel's Avengers should have been, offering players a single-player focused adventure with some of your favorite comic book characters. Mixed in with solid gameplay and continuous witty banter between your teammates, Guardians of the Galaxy will leave you already excited for what you would expect to be the inevitable sequel.",,,"After stumbling out the gate with last year’s Avengers, Square Enix has managed to steady the ship with Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. For the story alone, the game is well-worth playing, but it’s the abundance of lore, well-written dialogue and gorgeous locales that elevate it as one of the best Marvel games to date. If the game’s combat bore a tad more finesse, and if some of the glitches had been ironed out before launch then Guardians would be more in line with the quality we’ve seen from Marvel’s Spider-Man, but the game has shown that Square Enix can make the most of the license when steered in the right direction. I’m now very excited to see what the company can do next.","Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy surprises with a remarkable, true and emotional story with excellent performances, all in a unique graphic style, full of effects and color that give strength to the game and above all to its message. The gameplay is not at the level of everything else that is presented, but that doesn't make it a truly negative element. An ode to books, movies and fans, with a team that goes back to giving it all, something that the player won't forget, taking us to moments of laughter and sadness like no other Marvel game has ever done.",,,"Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy nicely balances a goofy, action-filled adventure with some genuinely heartfelt story moments, and the choices you’re given can add some surprising personal twists to your particular playthrough. Its combat and level design are relatively simple if still consistently entertaining, but it’s the relationships and banter between its characters that keep everything fresh as they evolve. It isn’t going to set the world on fire, but Guardians of the Galaxy is still another convincing example of how much fun a linear, no-frills, single-player campaign can be.",,,"Guardians Of The Galaxy is exactly what you want from a game in this franchise. Full of laughs, engaging action, and an epic, galaxy-spanning plot that hooks you from moment one.","At the end of the day, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is everything I wanted it to be. There’s classic Guardians snark, bickering, and epic fight scenes scored with tunes from my youth. It just needs a little more polish to make it really sing.",,,,"Much like the characters themselves, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a really funny mish-mash of ideas and concepts with some working better than others. At its best, the campaign is strong with well-produced cinematic cutscenes, likable characters, gorgeous environments and an action romp that excites when everything is in sync. On the flipside, the pacing of combat stops things from getting into a solid rhythm until later in the game, and I much preferred my time solving puzzles or platforming while enjoying the epic story. When so much of your journey will be spent in combat, that’s a bit of a shame. Despite some quirks, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a super-fun superhero adventure that hits more than it misses, with a banging soundtrack and a lot of personality that more than makes up for its shortcomings.","Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy may not be able to quite match the humor of James Gunn’s MCU films, but it’s packed with plenty of personality and decently fun (if not groundbreaking) combat. To its great credit, Eidos-Montréal’s story-driven approach always keeps the focus on its ragtag team of heroes, making for a worthwhile and memorable trip to the Cosmic Marvel universe.",,,,"Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the most fun games this year. Its linear storytelling provides the right story that goes all on in the cosmic enjoyment. Add in the fantastic spectacles with a kicking soundtrack, and this game will make you yell flark yes!","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a game with a lot of quality, but it is far from perfect. However, it is a product by a team that fulfilled their mission of providing a sincere and heartfelt game. It is well worth giving it a chance.","An adventure full of twists, with splendid dialogue and all the verve of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Perfect for supergroup fans and a good title to entertain everyone else.",,,,"There’s some frequent but minor performance issues aside. Be that as it may, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the most enjoyable games you’ll play all year. You might have never gotten into one of the comics or films. Still, there’s something in this space-adventure epic for everyone. You could wait until the last of the technical creases are ironed out, but none ruin the core experience. If you’re looking for a game that’s brimming with heart in both story and gameplay, this is one for you.",,,,,,"While I went into Guardians with a good feeling I’d enjoy it, I was surprised by just how much fun I ended up having. Moreso than the combat gameplay or even the stunning world design, what really cemented my enjoyment was its writing.",,,,"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy as a video game is a bit simple and repetitive, but still, it offers a funny, often moving, epic musical adventure with a smart Telltale-like narration.","Even if you’re fatigued by the endless amount of Marvel content, Guardians of the Galaxy shows a lot of heart and soul. The cast delivers unforgettable performances that are further highlighted by meaningful exploration and impactful narrative decisions. The adventure loses a bit of steam the longer it goes, due to overly familiar combat, but the team’s banter keeps things entertaining. Eidos Montreal has delivered a memorable and intimate take on the team of misfits that truly stands on its own.",,"Square Enix and Eidos Montreal don't exactly pull this job off flawlessly. In fact, it gets ugly at points. Yet, oddly enough, that feels very appropriate for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy.","Regardless of how synonymous the characters now are with their big-screen depictions, this version of the Guardians of the Galaxy is far and away my favourite. The exceptionally well-written story is backed by a cast of unique and complex characters whose interactions with each other are equally hilarious and heartfelt. The fun and frantic combat may take some warming to, but the reliance on team synergy is thematically rewarding and visually impressive. Looking past the few technical issues and outdated exploration, this is an action game that will appeal to comic fans and gamers alike.","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy doesn't feature an engaging combat system, save for the moments where the team huddles provide a loose connection to the much more engaging narrative theme of the strength of communication. The game instead shines via its storytelling, which is enhanced by a talented collection of voice actors and a wonderful soundtrack. If this game is your introduction to the titular heroes, it's not the best first impression, but sometimes when the galaxy needs to be saved, you can settle for good enough.",,"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a good game that wants to be, in Peter Quill's words, metal. It doesn't quite reach that mark, but compared to other recent Marvel video games that aren't Spider-Man, it succeeds more often than it fails. If you've liked other incarnations of the team's lovable misfits and misanthropes, you'll like what the developers have done here. And even if you're only somewhat aware of its Marvel background, there's a lot to love already here that a fresh coat of bug-fixing polish will only make better.",,"I really didn't expect to enjoy Guardians of the Galaxy as much as I did. The game's marketing left me incredibly lukewarm, and I wasn't sure what to expect, even after the first couple of hours with the game. What I found, however, is one of the best stories of the entire year. There's definitely a bit of tedium packed into the overall experience, but Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is an adventure well worth taking, warts and all.",,"Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is actually better when you’re not playing it: everything it does to get you onside with its quippy humour, its sharp story-telling, and its endearing characters, it loses in clunky, laborious combat, some appalling pacing, and baffling design decisions. It’s a damn shame that one of the best stories of the year – with some seriously impressive voice work and mo-cap – is tainted by a game that feels like it just doesn’t want to be played.","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy has some rough edges, but its solo team play mechanics are a perfect match for the dysfunctional superhero family.","Chiefly, it’s the writing and characterisation that makes Guardians more or less work. It delivered laughs, surprising moments of pathos and has some unpredictable twists that caught me totally off-guard, including a dog that shows up when you least expect it in the most hilarious way. Unfortunately these moments usually arrive when you’re not pushing buttons on the controller, having control wrenched away and to show you a gorgeous MCU-inspired cut scene. If emotional beats and smart storytelling are what you’re looking for, come right in. But the game is pretty rote, and, at that point, you wonder if this should have been on Disney+ and not your PS5.",,,"Like many, I enjoyed the Guardians of the Galaxy movie duology more than I thought I would. It’s the same for Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. It would have been easy to stretch the skin of a typical superhero movie plot over the bones of a standard action game and call it a day — kinda like most of Marvel’s Avengers. But Guardians defied being a lifeless, flesh hulk to instead be a living, breathing creature with a heart that beats and bleeds all over the screen.","Guardians of Galaxy are the real blast that Marvel fans needed after more than mediocre Avengers. The “worst” part of the game is a mere fact, that you are not able to enjoy every single comment in the background and enjoy very well written characters.",,,,,,"Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a blast for its entire run of 20-plus hours, and when it’s not entertaining you with goofy banter and situations, it’s aiming directly at your heart. The twitchy combat is like strapping a high-class hyperdrive engine to a well-worn ship held together with duct tape and bubblegum: it’s such a wild ride that you won’t even notice when it falls apart. Though the fighting has its issues, it’s decent enough to ferry you through the wonderfully dynamic story. For Guardians fans, this game is a no-brainer. But even if you’re not into the superhero thing, it’s also the grandest space opera game this side of Mass Effect. Between Guardians and Avengers, could we be headed for a Square Enix Cinematic Universe? If so, Guardians of the Galaxy may not be a final destination, but at least the spaceship knows which way to go. I’ll be hooked on a feeling for a while.",,,"All of these elements combine to create a game that is a jack of all trades, and master of none, but that’s a happy outcome considering how many different things it tries to do. A lot of what I’ve described so far probably sounds like a mashup of several different things that other games arguably do better, but Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy does everything with so much heart and charm that it overcomes some of the elements feeling a little empty and results in one of the best gaming adventures I’ve been on in 2021. Considering how much of a let-down the previous big Marvel game was, I am more than happy to shout how great this is without any conditions put on top.",,,,"For the most part it’s a game which understands its weaknesses (depth, polish, uniqueness) while being pretty good at foregrounding its strengths (variety, storytelling, visual splendor). It’s here to sell us that awkward smile, it’s Quill posing in front of a mirror in his corny leather jacket. Easy spectacle without too much crunchy, frustrating friction in the way.",,"As great as Marvel’s Avengers was, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy takes the framework of combat there and fine-tunes it.",,,,,,,Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a flarkin fantastic game; it's easily the best game of the year so far. My only disappointment? We need more Lipless.,,,,"Guardians of the Galaxy is fun to play because it has fun with itself. It’s clever, fast-paced, and never takes itself seriously. In other words, it’s the kind of game the Guardians of the Galaxy deserve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's certainly an interesting experience of trying to control an incredibly fast car and going, gradually, taking milliseconds off each lap and trying to get a better time. For enthusiasts, it's certainly a valid recommendation, but for newbies to the genre I believe there is a lot to be done for this to become a receptive title.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"At the end of the day, if you’re a big fan of ACC and want to get the best the game has to offer, this new-gen release is exactly what it’s supposed to be.

This update is miles better than any other ACC console offering, with its buttery-smooth gameplay and 4k graphics. The DLCs help to pad out the game and set it apart from any of its competitors. And, whilst the career mode doesn’t bring anything new to the table, the championship, challenge and online modes more than make up for it.

Striking character art enunciates facial features, while environments and background vistas look beautiful. With a great soundtrack to boot, the game has an incredibly strong style.

The game's characters and the randomness of its narrative invite you to experience it more than once. Although it may not be a game for everyone, especially those who might be looking for something with more action.",,,,,,,"Road 96 feels like a strange blend of experimental and conservative game design. The procedurally generated narrative is a good idea and one I’d like to see used again. However, the overarching plot is political without being substantive. It’s a story that would likely have been best served following a linear structure with player characters that had rich backstories that firmly tied them to the struggle going on in Petria.

Plus, building your own stunt arenas is great for those who prefer careful maneuvers.",,,,,,,,"If you've just got yourself a PS5, don't sleep on DIRT 5. It brings bombastic, arcadey racing to the console's launch lineup, giving you something totally different to play alongside the heavy hitters. Although the haptic feedback implementation is basic and one or two visual bugs remain, the core experience is seriously fun, and well worth checking out if you like driving sideways.",,,,,,,,"DIRT 5 on the PS5 is the best version of the game to get on PlayStation consoles, when it works. That’s a big caveat, and most gamers will not want to have to constantly remember to pre-emptively upload their save game after a few races, or risk losing hours of progress due to one unfortunate crash. This also necessitates a PlayStation Plus subscription, since copying PS5 save games to USB storage is unfortunately not an option as of this writing. Assuming these issues get patched out, then it is easy to recommend buying this on the PS5, because DIRT 5 is a showcase racing game for the next generation of consoles with its smart use of haptic feedback and ray tracing, all while delivering a smooth performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The last-generation version of DIRT 5 truly feels like a beta in comparison to this product. The game was designed with the PS5 hardware in mind and shouldn’t have seen a release on the PS4. This is an excellent way to experience what the PS5 is capable of; especially if you have a 4K 120hz television.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dirt 5 represents a complete about-face for the main Dirt series, shedding virtually all semblance of simulation in favour of an unabashed, arcade-inspired racing experience that draws from just about every influence you can name except its direct predecessor. It’s not especially deep, and there isn’t as much variety in the career mode as it claims, but it’s fast, frantic, and extremely handsome, and the wild and wacky stunt track editor truly has its hooks in me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dirt 5 is a departure from earlier entries in the series, as it goes full arcade racer. That’s to its credit though, as the actual racing is satisfying and exciting. This means that the vehicles and their customization options feel a bit shallow, which could disappoint some fans. Thanks to an incredible Playgrounds mode and some pretty next-gen visuals, Dirt 5 is a solid offering from Developer Codemasters.",,,,,,,"DIRT 5 is an excellent, stunning and simply enjoyable arcade racer that is easy for anyone to pick-up and play regardless of your motor vehicle knowledge with a career mode that is surprisingly entertaining. You may want to pick it up on PlayStation 5 though since it feels awesome to play with the new DualSense features.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Much buggier than the PS4 version, Dirt 5 is nonetheless a showcase for PS5 gaming, and a much-needed champion for splitscreen racing.

multiversus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"MultiVersus from Player First Games is a good fighting game. It does a good job of competing against the likes of Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. series. While it may not yet have the longevity of Nintendo’s golden child, MultiVersus’ characters, maps, and welcoming atmosphere are enough to convince any future wannabe fighter to give it a try.","Even with the balancing issues and a clear rough start to its first season, MultiVersus’ incredibly solid and unique core mechanics, along with its clear love and respect for every character and series that it represents, let it stand close to the top of the genre. It still needs some fine-tuning, but I’m confident that in a year’s time, MultiVersus will be standing strong next to Smash.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While it’s clear that some things need work on MultiVersus, it’s encouraging to see that the things that truly matter – the unlocking of characters and the core gameplay systems – are the things that have received the most attention. These are easily the two strongest tenets of MultiVersus’ offerings thus far. With time, I can only hope that the lack of variety in levels, lacklustre music, and slower cosmetic offerings can be remedied.",,,"MultiVersus is a solid Smash Bros. clone that's definitely promising, especially with its distinctly-playing characters and flexible gameplay. It may currently be slightly underwhelming in some regards but I'm looking forward to seeing how this project evolves over time.",,,,,,,,"Even in open beta, MultiVersus is a worthy competitor to Super Smash Bros. While it may not be able to quite match the scope and production values of Nintendo’s flagship platform fighter, its gameplay goes toe-to-toe with its incredibly established rival – and its excellent netcode completely outshines it. The most exciting thing is that this release is guaranteed to grow over time, and with the Warner Bros vaults practically bursting with iconic IP, this is one live service that looks to have a lot of life in it.",,,,,"MultiVersus, currently in Beta but already available, enters the ring with a gameplay accessible to all, a bit technical and immediately fun. It provides the show with its five-star cast and colorful artistic direction. The number of characters is still low and the clashes are sometimes rough, yet this does not prevent the title of Player First Games from doing well. The Free to Play economic model could well put off some fighting game aficionados while by being a ready-made gateway for neophytes wishing to discover the genre.",,,,"Even when stripping away the glossy licenses and arenas, Multiversus remains an excellent fighter that feels like a great barometer of how to do free-to-play right. That low barrier to entry makes it a great way to spend an evening with friends, and with more characters to come, it could grow into a true “Smash killer” over time.",,,,,,"Full of love for the characters, and crunchy to play, you owe it to yourself to give this a go – though the monetisation methods are off-putting.

It has many aspects to improve but its brightness in its gameplay, drawings and the character roster.",,,,,"The current free and paid mini Battle Passes and daily quests kept me busy throughout my time with MultiVersus. While I enjoyed unlocking content, the need to grind out repetitive bot matches to hit some numbers in a reasonable amount of time can be a slog. Completed seasonal goals annoyingly didn’t clear out for me so I had to dig into the menus and turn past a page of grayed-out items to check my progress constantly. Living games have the potential to go in frustrating directions, but MultiVersus has a strong foundation. If it can meaningfully roll out content and smooth out its rough edges, this could become a new crossover obsession for years to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With a strong initial roster, great visual presence and focus on cooperative combat, MultiVersus carves out a distinct spot for itself in the platform brawler genre.","""Surreal"" is actually a perfect word to describe MultiVersus, a game that brings together iconic characters and makes them fight. These characters are as authentic as they come, feeling as if they've been ripped straight from their source material thanks to excellent voice work. The team-based mechanics are truly beyond anything else offered in a platform fighter, while the classic 1v1 format also impresses. The roster offers plenty of variety, though unlocking all of the characters without having to dip into the real-world wallet will definitely be a chore. We don't know how much of its power MultiVersus has tapped into yet--the open beta will soon give way to Season 1--but as it stands now the game has smashed any and all expectations. Even if MultiVersus doesn't unseat the king, it is more than ready to rule its own little corner of the kingdom.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you like games like Astral Chain, you will not go wrong with Scarlet Nexus, especially as it’s being set up as a potential future franchise. The combination of telekinesis and action elements are nothing new, but SN does it beautifully by combining it with other different skills and magics. If you like Anime and brainpunk themes, Scarlet Nexus is for you.",,,"Whether you latch on to the interesting technological tale of Scarlet Nexus or dig into its intricate combat system, Scarlet Nexus is well worth your time and effort. It's full of beautiful characters, strange creatures and plot twists. The camera can be irksome and some of the environments can look dated but overall the experience is a pleasant one. There is a fair amount of content for your hard-earned cash and the game never outstays its welcome. I can recommend it to most players, even people who rarely dip into the genre, such as myself.",,"Scarlet Nexus provided an enjoyable and distinctive experience with an elaborate combat system and an interesting story, and it may be a step towards launching a series of Scarlet nexus games in the future.","Scarlet Nexus is a huge surprise. His combat is wonderful and his story, despite having less inspired moments, knows how to generate interest. The differences between the two protagonists and the surprises are enough to please any fan of the genre.",,"While we expected more exploration and presence of the (amazing) scifi urban enviroment, we can't deny that Scarlet Nexus delivers in the action part. Fans of shonen anime will especially enjoy many of its moments in and out of combat.","Scarlet Nexus’ stylish psychokinesis-based action is tons of fun. That being said, the player’s attacks tend to leave big openings for the opponent, and with many enemies that have a specific weakness you need to strike, it can become quite stressful. While I had some issues on the story side as well, the well realized characters and great pacing were enough to make me overlook its shortcomings.",,"A deep combat system, great use of the DualSense in its version for PS5, complex narrative full of great moments and memorable characters, art direction that enchants and music that falls in love, are just some of the great virtues that one can find in it. Scarlet Nexus universe. Of course there are marked defects and everything, but it is undoubted that his successes far outweigh his mistakes. This new team at Bandai Namco Studios has earned significant respect, which I hope they can build on very soon with a sequel. Needless to say, if you are a fan of action games with RPG elements, this new proposal is one that you cannot miss.",,,"Scarlet Nexus is one of the better action RPGs to hit this current generation of consoles. It’s a gorgeous game with a complicated backend that makes you want to keep playing. The side-quests might be forgettable, but it certainly has a lot more to offer with its main story.","If you’re after an anime-infused action romp in a similar vein to Akira or Sword Art Online, Scarlet Nexus is almost certainly worth a punt. However, there are a few caveats. Combat is excellent yet not without its flaws, while the story being told and characters you encounter don’t have nearly enough depth to feel emotionally resonant. The potential for something brilliant is here, but much like Code Vein before it, this is a game that seems determined to stop itself from achieving something truly special.",A brilliant battle system is let down somewhat by the largely underwhelming side stories and meandering companions of Scarlet Nexus.,"Scarlet Nexus is one of the most interesting new JRPGs that we’ve seen in a while from a big publisher. Combining a beautifully elegant, but also visceral combat system with rich and evocative theme, and hugely entertaining characters, this game is available on the previous generation, I know, bit in design and execution it’s very much the perfect new-generation experience.","What Scarlet Nexus lacks in character development and story, it more than makes up for with its excellent combat system, which has some of the best representations of superpowers in modern gaming.",,,"Scarlet Nexus is a video game that, despite the fact that in the long run it can become repetitive and has a complex story with some inconsistencies, it has a really well-designed combat system that is fun. Technically it is a step forward in anime titles, so Bandai Namco has created a new work more than worthy and with good ideas.",,,"Scarlet Nexus is, ultimately, some gorgeous, action-heavy comfort food. It is Saturday morning anime in game form, and while it will struggle to hold your attention from a story perspective, it’s also a good way to lose 30 hours in a fun combat system. It’s not a narrative powerhouse, but if you need a vehicle for bashing monsters with the might of your brain, it’ll suit that need just fine.",,"There is a lot to love about Scarlet Nexus. From cool gameplay systems and engaging plot, to memorable music and stylish visuals. But sadly the game lacks much-needed polish. Let's hope that problems will be ironed out in the potential sequel.",,,,"Offering a lengthy adventure that you’ll need to play through twice if you want the full picture, Scarlet Nexus is entertaining enough. Due to numerous issues with its gameplay, however, it’s a game that’s carried by its story. It’s a shame really, because the world created here is genuinely interesting and unique; I’d certainly like to see more Scarlet Nexus games in the future, and will definitely check out the anime when it arrives on Netflix. But there were times throughout my adventure where the combat was irritating rather than fun, and traipsing through an environment just felt like a chore rather than an exciting foray into the unknown.",,,"Scarlet Nexus has phenomenal combat that stands tall above many other ARPGs, with a deep story and some gorgeous visuals.",,"Scarlet Nexus turned out to be a lovely combination of quick gameplay and an intriguing story of betrayal, conflict on a large scale full of plot twists and surprises. The interactions between the team members contribute to both story and diverse gameplay. The side-missions however don't add anything and could've been removed completely.","With a great story full of plot twists and a robust, varied and spectacular combat system, Scarlet Nexus is one of the best ""anime style"" video games Bandai Namco has ever made. If you like the genre or this kind fo stories, give it a chance.","Scarlet Nexus marries varied and unique action RPG combat to two extended campaigns featuring engaging protagonists and a cast of memorable supporting players. Using its brain punk conceit to power a range of extended combat techniques, Scarlet Nexus is at its best in the thick of the fight, when the player can mix and match melee weapons, telekinetic beatdowns, and whatever talents the team on hand has to share.","Scarlet Nexus is a nice beginning for a new franchise that offers an interesting new universe and some unique details, but still has room to improve. In the bright side you'll have some excellent combat mechanics, but lurking in the dark is a pretty static narrative and a world that claims to be explored... While you just can go following a straight line throught it.",Scarlet Nexus was quite an enjoyable experience. The game’s unique visuals and art design thankfully met my expectations and the fast paced combat was both fun and satisfying.,,,,,,"I think the world of Scarlet Nexus has a lot to offer, and I enjoyed getting a significant taste of it. Its concepts on brain power and psionic combat feel fresh, at least artistically, and I want to see where it possibly goes. I'm still abuzz over the final boss confrontation. I don't think it's quite for everyone, but fans of the anime style of storytelling will find something to connect with here.",,,"Despite some glaring flaws in its pacing and length, I’ve come away from Scarlet Nexus enjoying what it had to offer. It delivers on the promise a brain-punk inspired world with an enjoyable narrative and a stylish albeit simple combat system. The result is a title that’s greater than the sum of its parts and is worth experiencing if you can look past its problems.",,"Great mix of Tales and Persona with refreshing, fun fights but far too linear social interaction.",Scarlet Nexus is an intriguing new IP that definitely shows promise for a potential sequel so if you enjoy anime-infused action RPGs then you likely won't regret slaying the many gnarly mutants within its unique futuristic game world.,,,"Scarlet Nexus does a lot of things right, but it fails to offer a cohesive gameplay experience. I think it would be best described as a visual novel with action-RPG elements rather than vice-versa. While the story is compelling enough to keep you going until the end, the game is full of bloat that needs to be cut. Despite its shortcomings, Scarlet Nexus is one of the better action RPG titles coming from Bandai Namco. I just wish it would have more respect for the player's time, and do away with all the uninteresting fluff that doesn't tie in the story.","Scarlet Nexus is a charming new IP from Bandai Namco. It looks fine, has a solid background and some good gameplay mechanics. If you are looking for a good anime style action-RPG, it's definitely worth your time.",,"An interesting story with well-developed characters and expert enemy design, that - however - does take a while to really get going. On top of that, not every sidequest is worth your attention. Don't let that stop you, though. Scarlet Nexus is a great game.",,"Scarlet Nexus is an enjoyable, polished action RPG, but despite its interesting concepts and setting, it all feels a bit stunted. An intriguing plot is hampered by sloppy storytelling, and the combat system is good fun, but it loses its edge long before the credits roll. If you can play past the game's flaws, there's a lot to like about the brain punk world of Scarlet Nexus — just don't expect it to rewire your own grey matter.",,,"For fans of anime-style action RPGs, Scarlet Nexus is highly recommended, but you have to be able to withstand the typical Japanese vagueness in the story. This doesn't fully release the potential, but the combat system makes up for a lot.",,"Scarlet Nexus is a big hit when it comes to the action. With its nervous and supercharged fights, you quickly become powerful controller in hand, especially when you can borrow the power of your allies on the fly. This action is helped by framerate which does not falter on next-gen consoles despite the deluge of effects on the screen which can cause readability concerns. If the proposed universe is visually attractive, we regret not being able to enjoy it anymore because of a cruel lack of additional content. Ditto for the story which is certainly interesting but which is served by a more than minimalist staging. A good first draft which, we hope, will serve as a solid basis for a more ambitious sequel in the years to come.",,,"I'm truly appreciative of the storytelling. Japanese sci-fi has long been a genre I enjoy. Last year players were spoiled with 13 Sentinels, and Scarlet Nexus has delivered another wonderfully woven narrative worth playing. Do not sleep on this game.",,"Scarlet Nexus is one of the most memorable anime video games by Bandai Namco Studios. The story is compelling, the lore is great, and the pure action combat formula works just right. It still retains some flaws from the past, like a forgettable level design and enemies that may feel repetitive, but it remains an excellent battle shonen, a good action RPG and, overall, a great video game.","Scarlet Nexus convinces with a great story, which is meaningfully interwoven with the abilities of the characters and the unique opponent design.",,,,"This psychically gifted title has a killer look and telekinetically wielded right hook. Unfortunately, it fails to read our mind and outstays its welcome. [Issue#4, p.75]","Scarlet Nexus has surprised me. Not everything is perfect, but what I was most interested in it more than delivers. [Recommended]",,,,"Though I thought I knew what it was all about, Scarlet Nexus has consistently surprised me at every turn. Even though I played the demo—which showcased some of the various powers you could activate in combat—I did not expect combat to be as deep and varied as it is. No spoilers, but I’ve even found myself caught completely off-guard by plot twists at points. If the game keeps up the surprises, I’d be confident defending it as one of the greats. If it doesn’t, well, it’s been fun. [Impressions]","For anime lovers and anyone who enjoyed “Fire Emblem: Three Houses,” the game will be a hit.","Scarlet Nexus has a colorful cast of characters and an impressive variety of gameplay mechanics, but for me, the unexpected cherry on top was its story. The chapters are very well-paced, and none of them overstays its welcome. 2021 is seeing quite a lot of JRPGs, with many of them being continuations of existing franchises or just remasters. But after having played through both of Scarlet Nexus’ storylines, I believe it has the potential to be a surprise hit this year for fans of the genre. Don’t let this brand-new futuristic brainpunk adventure slip past you.",,,"Scarlet Nexus shines thanks to its combat and universe, but it feels like it should have been more ambitious, particularly with the depth of the combat and the level design.",,,"Scarlet Nexus could have easily become a new IP used to test a few systems as the studio focuses on larger projects. However, there's an awesome battle system here that evolves throughout the entire campaign. Each fight has a brilliant rhythm to it as you take advantage of enemy weaknesses and use the environments to your advantage. The team introduces a large cast of characters but still manages to provide insight into their goals to make it worth seeing through to the end. Sadly, not everything works, but you might forget about floaty controls and convoluted narrative as you ride atop a bus into the battlefield.",,"A triumphant new IP from Bandai Namco, Scarlet Nexus is probably the best RPG of the year so far. Its compellingly dark story will keep you guessing through two necessary playthroughs, while its engaging psychokinetic combat is in a class of its own, albeit with exceptionally streamlined progression. Throwing your toys around has never been so much fun.","Scarlet Nexus lives and dies by its combat, which is a good thing, because the combat is great. It's fast, frantic, consistently enjoyable, grows progressively more complex, and feels surprisingly strategic on a very fundamental level. But in most other ways, the game fails to live up to its potential, most notably in how it fails to do justice to a good setting and solid world-building with uninteresting characters, a mindless narrative, and deeply flawed storytelling.",,"Scarlet Nexus is a visually remarkable anime-style action RPG, with an awesome cel shading implementation for both the characters and some of the maps, and some of the craziest enemies we've ever seen.","Scarlet Nexus is a complex creature, the mirror reflection of a layered and mysterious imaginary that hides a small rough diamond under a blanket of arcana.","Similarly to Code Vein, Scarlet Nexus offers a compelling universe, a smart gameplay and a fascinating art direction, but is limited by asset recycling when it comes to enemies and locations, a confusing plot and little side content. Bandai Namco is off to a good start with new IP, but needs to improve under these production areas.",,,,,,,,"If you like the sound of a deep RPG with extensive combat mechanics, Scarlet Nexus shouldn’t disappoint. If you are expecting something more akin to Devil May Cry, you might find the extensive storytelling gets in the way of the gameplay a little too much. With that said, you can still enjoy it if you’re not an anime connoisseur. There’s plenty of fun to be had for all players because it’s great once it gets going – but I fear it might lose people in its opening few hours.",,"It’s understandable to take a look at Scarlet Nexus and write it off as “just another anime game,” but doing so would be a big mistake. This is an ambitious undertaking from Bandai Namco, one that attempts to blend the two disparate genres of character-action game and large-scale JRPG, and achieves an impressive level of success. Its combat and thin enemy variety don’t hold up all the way to the end of the combined 40 hours of its dual campaigns, but its story and characters absolutely do, and make for a surprise breakout hit of 2021.",,,"Scarlet Nexus combines intense combat with a twisting, turning storyline that comes in two parts, providing players two different perspectives to experience the weird and wonderful world of New Himuka.",,,,"Ultimately, Bandai Namco’s done a fine job with Scarlet Nexus and there’s an entertaining action RPG within. There are small flaws like a lacking side quest system and those minor story issues, but thanks to in-depth combat and an engaging story, it kept me invested until the end. It’s a step up from Code Vein and whichever playthrough you end up choosing (if not both), Scarlet Nexus comes highly recommended.","Scarlet Nexus combines an enthralling story with fascinating characters and an addictive combat system that demands your attention. As you slowly peel back the layers of its cast, the twists and turns of the narrative will keep you engaged throughout its lengthy adventure, and as your skills increase, battles become a chaotic dance of exploding enemy bits, crazy finishing movies and endorphin increasing pleasure. While there are some areas that can feel repetitive at times and the visual novel presentation of its cutscenes might not be for everyone, there's a lot packed into this dual protagonist story that begs for an extra playthrough as soon as you finish your first. Scarlet Nexus is unmatched when it comes to style and oomph. It manages to incorporate so many clever and creative combat systems that are slick and exciting that it far outweighs the slower pace of its narrative with in-your-face, over-the-top action that simply must be played to be believed.",,A decent action rpg with anime visuals and twisted story. But the starmain focus of the game are without a doubt the cool fights with their plentiful abilities.,,,,"Scarlet Nexus shines for a simple but very complete and fun battle system, as well as having an organic concept that convinces.

Combat is fast-paced, visuals are bright and colourful and the story is so wonderfully bizarre that it will keep you wanting to keep playing. It may not be a game for everyone and it may not be without its flaws but those flaws are counteracted by what it does right. There’s a lot of mileage in the game for those that it clicks with.",,,,,"Scarlet Nexus does so much right that it’s a shame some of these troubles hold it back. They feel like the sort of things tied up in creating something new, problems that exist due to a lack of budget or different groups working on the game not being entirely on the same page until later in development. Still, despite these flaws, Scarlet Nexus brings an impressive new world to life while featuring deeply engaging combat. That’s no small thing. Fans of the genre will find a game well worth their time. I only hope that in a few years, we’ll be playing an even stronger sequel which irons out these nagging issues.",,,,,"A great launch for a new IP from Bandai Namco. Scarlet Nexus looks good, provides a great story, and the gameplay is even better. Definitively a success.","Scarlet Nexus more than delivers on the action with its impressive combat system, which alone almost makes it worth the price of admission. Surrounded by an intriguing world and strong cast of characters, it has the makings of a solid new series for Bandai Namco, though exploration leaves something to be desired. Offering up two similar campaigns might seem like a huge misstep, but completing either protagonist’s story provides a satisfying narrative and conclusion on its own, and the intimidating task of a second playthrough is tempered by the inclusion of new game plus. At the end of this journey, we’re left fulfilled, but strangely still yearning for more, wondering at the possibilities the future might hold for this striking new endeavor.",,"The anime aesthetic may be a turn off for some players, but those people would be doing themselves a disservice. Scarlet Nexus is a game worth experiencing. It's a game that took me by total surprise and a world I hope to explore more in the future.",,"Even though the plot devolves into a trope-filled sludge pool by the end, I don’t feel like Scarlet Nexus was a waste of time. Yes, the excitement of combat begins to taper off towards the end of Scarlet Nexus’s twenty-odd-hour runtime--and the areas in the final stretch of the game feel overly long--but I had a good deal of fun mixing up my SAS abilities, crushing enemies in my Brain Field, and watching my team have a video game tournament at our base to settle an argument over living space boundaries. It might not be a new pinnacle of action-game storytelling, but Scarlet Nexus is still plenty of fun in the right places.",,,,"Scarlet Nexus is slick, stylish, smartly executed, and just all-around cool. What I want most of all, having wrapped up Scarlet Nexus, is more.",,"Scarlet Nexus takes a more is more approach to its design, which suits the game’s visuals and action very well. It’s loud, sumptuous and thrilling, with layers of complexity and some amazing monsters to fight. It’s just a shame it also has to battle so hard against a less accomplished story that’s desperate to steal top billing.","Scarlet Nexus is a must-play for any fan of Japanese action RPGs and standard JRPGs. If the story doesn’t grab your attention, the combat will. It has enough meat to its action to distract from its very minor blemishes. Its characters are a delight to interact with and seeing them grow together really had me fully invested in all of their arcs. I left the experience craving another title like it that takes its excellent action even further.",,,,,,,,"Scarlet Nexus offers an entertaining adventure, with a fast, fluid and challenging combat system, making it the ideal game to enjoy this summer. Perfect for anime and hack and slash lovers.",,,"Despite a slow start, a rough final dungeon, weak side content, and an ambition that surpasses its grasp, Scarlet Nexus manages to excel in the most important area for any game: being fun. Combat never gets old as you tear apart your enemies in glorious style, and the large cast of characters really grows on you. I hope we see more of this gameplay and setting. If you can forgive a few flaws, Scarlet Nexus is a joy to play and has the potential to become a beloved franchise.",,,"Scarlet Nexus is an easy game to enjoy and a hard one to hate. It’s so unabashedly earnest about everything it set out to do that even with my issues I couldn’t help but reflect fondly back on my time playing. Most of what it tries to accomplish is done so adequately or successfully, which means a majority of what I had to discuss were parts that broke me out of the vibes presented to me. The combat is free form and incredibly creative, the visuals might be some of the finest to ever come from Bandai Namco, and the story is dense yet largely satisfying. There is fantastic framework in place now for a sequel, and I hope it sells enough so this team can continue to flesh out their vision.",,,,,"Scarlet Nexus reminds me a little of The Caligula Effect, in a way. Not in theme or style, but in tone, in energy, and the way it uses the JRPG format to go down some fascinating, thought-provoking paths. But where such games are not unusual from smaller developers, it’s a rare joy to see a publisher like Bandai Namco take the same risks, and to see those experimental ideas get the budget they need to truly shine. In a world where the “punk” suffix is often just a shallow aesthetic choice, Scarlet Nexus truly lives up to its “brainpunk” vision.",,,,"Scarlet Nexus is an excellent way to get your JRPG fix. It’s stylish, has an evolving storyline, unique characters, and a wicked fun battle system. It does try to do a lot, and in doing so falls a little short at times, but this is something that will only bog you down if you let it. The game has a lot to offer and boredom is the last thing you’ll feel when you’re running around swinging buses at enemies. If you’ve ever wondered what can be done when truly using the power of the mind, this title offer you a fresh perspective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We were drawn in by its trailer showcasing its eye-catching visuals, but have been very happy to find that it has real substance. Its combat is exhilarating and easy to get to grips with, yet has enough depth to keep you going back for more. And with its many characters – ahem, classes – as well as a pleasing selection of modes, there’s plenty to go at. Whether you’re new to the fighting game malarkey, or a seasoned pro, this definitely deserves your attention.",,,"DNF Duel is an extremely welcoming fighting game that I’d recommend to genre veterans and newcomers alike. The battles are tense, the visuals are out of this world and the inputs and tutorials make it really easy to pick up and play.

Arc System Works has struck the perfect balance: the game is accessible for newcomers, yet includes enough complexity for veterans. On the battlefield, the game offers new ideas that will make you strategize and continually plan ahead.

However, with its solid netcode, stunning aesthetic and deceptively deep mechanics, DNF Duel hits the sweet spot.",,,"DNF Duel is a good game with beautiful graphics and accessible mechanics.

The Story Mode provides interesting background about each character’s reason for fighting while the smooth mechanics give reason for having them continue to fight. The animation quality and art direction make this one of those games that is almost as entertaining to watch as it is to play. All the design elements of gameplay, graphics and music come together in a way that proves that while most current games embrace 3D, there’s still relevance in 2D tournament fighters.",,,,"DNF Duel is a ridiculous fighting game in the best way possible. Simple inputs and meaty one-button attacks provide an easy entryway for beginners, but the advanced defensive mechanics and powerful properties of your attacks create fast & frenzied action that I can't get enough of.

The idea of constructions is the future of this type of games and its rhythm, like a musou, makes Wild Hearts dynamic, original and fun.

Well worth a look if you’re into lengthy epic boss battles.","More than a Monster Hunter clone, Wild Hearts managed to be a worthy competitor to the Capcom series, thanks to its original ideas and handling of well-known concepts. Omega Force has delivered a new series that could well become a mainstay for the Japanese studio.",,,"Wild Hearts is a massive single-player and co-op hunting game with an RPG backbone supporting it. The mixture of story, creative mechanics, thick strategy, and beautiful visuals makes this a top-tier hunting experience. If the controls could be improved a bit and break from traditional stuck-in-the-action sequences, it would be nearly perfect. Overall, it’s a great first go at a genre that is severely lacking in competition.",,"Wild Hearts is a worthy competitor to Monster Hunter, boasting brilliantly creative weapons and fearsome beasts to match, scuppered only by an infuriating camera. Omega Force deftly avoids delving into colonist themes, and Wild Hearts is all the better for it .",,Wild Hearts is a class act and an impressive first step at a franchise that feels entirely original.,"Wild Hearts is a solid MonHun genre title and there are solid refreshing elements like Karakuri building system. Eight weapons and four vast maps are enough for practicing skills but uneven difficulty spikes and some bugs can be challenging. On the other hand, three player co-op is a welcome addition and preferred way of gameplay",,,,,"While the community will ultimately decide whether or not Wild Hearts lives on as long as any given Monster Hunter iteration, I hope it does.","Though it can be a blurry mess at times, Wild Hearts does plenty right to justify a play by both monster hunter veterans and newcomers to the genre. The Karakuri system is genius and enhances an already fantastic combat experience, and co-op is wonderfully implemented, making it easy to group up with other hunters. Wild Hearts is a fantastic first attempt by Omega Force, as it goes toe-to-toe with an established franchise and gets in a few attacks of its own, and I’m excited to see how the team builds upon this victory, Karakuri-style!",,,,,"Despite all of Wild Hearts‘ faults, it’s hard not to be be taken in by its charms. Omega Force has really tried to create a solid Monster Hunter contender with this one, and it mostly succeeds. There are some genuinely neat ideas here, and its monster designs are a welcome breath of fresh air. Overall, it’s a great game in its own right, but it’s more exciting when you consider it a base to be improved upon with further iterations.",,,,"EA and Omega Force’s unlikely venture succeeds by being the perfect entry point to the hunter genre. This is the accessible radio single to Monster Hunter’s prog album odyssey: it’s silly, flawed and probably not destined to be an all-timer, but if you’re in the right mood, my god is it fun. Whether it’ll continue to dig its talons into me remains to be seen, but after years of frustration, I finally feel ready to dive further into this once-impenetrable genre.",,"Wild Hearts is a more than solid proposal that manages to come out well from its comparison with Monster Hunter. Its distinctive points are clear and give the game a style of its own. The Japanese design and setting is convincing and although it is far from being a round IP, Wild Hearts could have a great future as a saga.","If the developers were hoping to launch an IP that could stand side-by-side with other monster-hunting games, they can rest easy. Wild Hearts shares some mechanics with other titles in the genre, but it’s best when staking out unique territory. Hunting Kemono alone and with others, using the Karakuri, and just enjoying the game’s satisfying loop are all a lot of fun. Best of all, Wild Hearts has the mechanical foundation and potential for endless DLC and sequels. If they can live with its slightly disappointing visuals, fans of that “other” monster-hunting game have a viable and addictive alternative in Wild Hearts.",,"Perhaps my biggest takeaway from Wild Hearts is that I didn’t once find myself lamenting for Monster Hunter. Wild Hearts was perhaps a risky endeavour, but it’s one that’s paid off with impressive results. While genre newcomers can treat the land of Azuma as a gateway to monster hunting, long-standing genre fans will find plenty here to keep them happy until the next Monster Hunter adventure arrives.","Technical issues affect both the performance and visual quality of Wild Hearts to a considerable degree. However, the visual style, the gameplay structure, the great use of Karakuri for hunting and exploration, as well as the very good co-op make it a fun and original title. If you have the patience to wait for updates and the technical problems to be resolved, it is certainly a great option in the hunting genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Wild Hearts improves on all existing aspects of it's main competitor, Monster Hunter. The game adds a touch of originality with surprising and functional mechanics. Fun and challenging, the game is a visual spectacle that excites and also delivers unique rewards for the players.",,,"Wild Hearts is indeed a serious competitor to Monster Hunter. If the game is not so different from its model, the form is another story. The Karakuri completely change the dynamics of hunting and exploring and make the whole thing very dynamic. It's extremely generous, there's plenty to play for many, many hours and it's well written, as surprising as that is for the genre. Alas, even if Wild Hearts has a beautiful Japanese art direction, technically it's clearly not up to scratch. Not only are there glitches almost everywhere, but the game can be very ugly at times, especially because of its droopy textures. A few patches will therefore be necessary to get the most out of it. Too bad, we were close to an absolutely huge title. However, if you get past the not-so-sexy packaging, Wild Hearts might just surprise you.","Wild Hearts isn’t a perfect game, but it distinguishes itself due in part to the magical charm of its karakuri mechanic and monsters that are mysterious and fascinating. It may look and sometimes play like a Monster Hunter game, but the more you get into it, the more fights you win, and the more karakuri you build, the more it feels like a breath of fresh air.",,,"Wild Hearts is, at times, an utterly thrilling game. It's a game that will leave you kicking yourself for a poorly timed dodge or a missed opportunity, and jumping out of your chair when you finally topple a troublesome foe with a last-ditch, go-for-broke attack. There's a handful of technical issues, a mite too much repetition, and some quibbles about the difficulty, but the core monster hunting experience is spectacular enough that the joys far outweigh the frustrations.","Wild Hearts does not invent the black thread at the time in hunting games, but it does offer some attractive game mechanics thanks to the Karakuri system, which dramatically changes the way you face giant monsters. Omega Force proves again that it is a versatile game studio with many talents and the ability to do different games. The result is a very entertaining title that will depend on its community to keep going.",,"Wild Hearts is most fun when it's fair and unfortunately that often requires multiple players. Monster Hunter players will feel right at home in the world of Azuma, but will still be surprised by the innovative and constantly evolving Karakuri system. However, the high degree of difficulty, technical flaws and the uninteresting story will mainly scare off newcomers to the genre.",Arguably the best Monster Hunter clone ever made and while it’s not quite as good as Capcom’s series it does have some unique and interesting ideas of its own – despite initial impressions to the contrary.,"Without revolutionizing the genre, Wild Hearts offers a direct approach to the game of hunting. With the mechanics of the Karakuris, the fights take advantage of a strategic dimension thanks to these constructions that are effective both against monsters and to adjust the levels in its own way. Far from forgetting the essential, the experience of Omega Force offers a nervous and dynamic gameplay, characteristic of the studio, supported by a limited, but varied arsenal.",,,"Wild Hearts seems to have the right ideas about what a modern monster-hunting game needs. If it could inject some of the flashier bits from their other games, then Omega Force would definitely have a fierce competitor on its hands in the monster hunting genre of games. Right now, it does of course stand in Capcom’s shadow, but suddenly this subgenre has started heating up. Competition breeds innovation, and it’s exciting to wonder what we’ll see next.",,,,,"Yes, Wild Hearts has copied the Monster Hunter formula, but it manages to go beyond that by distinguishing itself with elements never before seen. The use of Karakuris, these structures that can be invoked to help triumph, brings a lot to the gameplay of the game. The game then gains in intensity, in strategy, but also in the possibility of combat, which makes the confrontations epic and quite enjoyable.",,,,,,,,,,"Wild Hearts offers a fresh take on the monster hunting formula. The nature infused Kemono are an original approach to monster designs and some of them look so majestic you almost feel bad about killing them. Azuma is a gorgeous location, and using the different forms of the Karakuri to travel gives exploration a unique quality. The Karakuri in general really what sets Wild Hearts apart from other monster hunting, as its myriad functions add a new dimension to both exploration and battling Kemono. There is a bit of a learning curve and steep difficulty but learning the intricacies of Karakuri make overcoming the challenge a very rewarding and fun experience.","Wild Hearts treads familiar ground as you hunt one monstrous beast after another, but Omega Force has added new tricks and gimmicks that help separate it from the games it draws inspiration from. At the end of the day, it proudly stands as a unique experience with its own identity.",Quotation forthcoming.,"While the game stumbles here and there regarding camera issues, story, and a lack of enemy variety at launch, Koei Tecmo's Omega Force and EA's latest game still manages to land on its own two feet.

From the striking monster designs, distinct weapon variety, and engaging combat, hunters will have a new favorite game to join up with friends and take down enormous foes. Outside of some dips in pacing in the later hours, and a few repetitive encounters, there is little holding this game back from becoming a new name in the genre.",,,,,"A solid alternative to the Monster Hunter series that sincerely surprised us with its combat flow and complex karakuri system. There's definitely a lot of balancing to be done, and the PC version has some clear optimization problems... still, this is a great action game that we wholeheartedly recommend, and has a lot of potential for the future.",,"It may not be the ""Monster Hunter killer"" many people were waiting for, but Wild Hearts has some good ideas that would have just needed more time to reach their maximum potential.",,,,,,,,,,Wild Hearts’ building mechanics add a very fun twist to its familiar but well-executed co-op monster hunting formula.,,,,,,,,"Wild Hearts takes the hunting action to the next level with vicious beasts, a vast world to explore, and an array of powerful weapons. But that's not all—the magical Karakuri crafting system seamlessly blends with combat and exploration to offer an awe-inspiring experience. It's so fluently integrated into the game that you'll be amazed at how much it advances combat, exploration, and the engaging gameplay loop. Still, the adventure suffers from visual issues and a waning grind. Even so, Wild Hearts is my new monster-hunting addiction.",,Naughty Monster Hunter clone struggling with technical issues. The highly innovative Karakuri and hilarious monsters save the hunt from falling into oblivion.,"As a new IP, destined to be compared to one of the world's most beloved hunting action franchises inevitably, 'Wild Hearts' seems to have successfully secured its own identity by composing an original system and open world. Although the button arrangement for the console version is somewhat sloppy, It will most likely be a great option if you are looking for a new hunting action game.","WILD HEARTS is a pretty fun monster hunter-like game that stands out for its use of tools called Karakuri. The gameplay is very fast, intuitive but simplified in a good way. However, at the graphic level I found some mix ups and downs but I enjoyed it a lot.",,,,,,,,,,,,"The team at Omega Force have done a commendable job with Wild Hearts, as it does just enough to stand out from the Monster Hunter games that Capcom has created. This ambitious project boasts a beautiful high fantasy feudal Japan setting and an intuitive and game-changing Karakuri building mechanic. However, the high cost of entry and performance issues hold it back from being truly captivating.","Still, that Wild Hearts gets so much right on its first tentative step into the arena is bloody impressive. Omega Force has created the first title I’ve played that is a genuine contender in the space and they’ve done more than enough to justify Wild Hearts’ place in it. The result is something meaningfully different in a genre no one else has been able to touch. It’s kind of like if someone made a Souls-like on par with an actual Souls.",,,,,"In an era when Monster Hunter dominates the space, it's nice to have a newcomer step up to the plate and offer some competition, and Wild Hearts is a good start. It has a solid core with fun monsters to fight and the Karakuri system is genuinely great, setting it apart from its peers. While performance woes can hinder it, Wild Hearts is still a good time overall, and hopefully the start of a bright new future for the IP.",,"I loved Wild Hearts from the moment that a giant flower-infested rat spawned an entire towering cherry blossom tree in the middle of our epic first fight, and my love only grew as I experienced its weapons, gadgets, environments, music, and other creatures.",Wild Hearts is packed with creative mechanics and delightful flourishes that make it a welcome and exciting addition to the monster hunting genre.,,,,,"From the story and the karakuri to the kemono monsters themselves, Wild Hearts has some world-class mechanics and writing behind it. It falters in a few important places as well, especially regarding performance, but that doesn’t mean it’s not worth your time and money. If you love taking down fantastical beasts of every shape and size, this time in a world inspired by feudal Japan, there’s no substitute.",,,,,,,"This is still Monster Hunter at its core, a game that requires patience, demands a lot of time, and forces you to kill cute creatures. If Monster Hunter World — the most approachable entry in the series to date — didn’t sell you, I can’t imagine Wild Hearts will, either. But if you’re already a fan of this style of game, it offers just enough differences to feel both familiar and refreshing simultaneously.",,,"Wild Hearts couldn't have been a better start for a new IP. While the experience shares more than a few similarities with that of the Monster Hunter series, the unique monster design, the great weapon variety and the Karakuri crafting mechanics give the game a unique flavor that makes it stand out easily among similar games. Performance issues, sadly, impact the experience considerably on all formats, preventing it from reaching greater heights, but even in its current state, the game is a more than worthy purchase for fans of the genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I really dug the 1970s vibe of the game both in the art direction and especially the score. This makes the game stand out aesthetically from other games.

Wholly unique and utterly engaging, Rollerdome is a blast.",,"From its action to its slick presentation, everything about Rollerdrome screams “effortlessly cool” from the moment it ramps off. Its breakneck pacing and unabating stages make each victory feel well earned, and revisiting each feels like a mastery that verges on transcendental.","Rollerdrome combines the skate game feeling of satisfaction from landing the perfect trick, with the pulse-pounding adrenaline of fighting for your very life. Between the story that you must find for yourself and the varied arenas that throw new ways to move and do tricks, there’s never a dull moment to be found. Rollerdrome is by no means a long game, but it is one that is just so easy to pick up and play.","Much like OlliOlli World, Rollerdrome strikes the perfect balance between engaging gameplay, score-chasing, and challenging progression, this time with an ingenious shooting/skating premise. It’s so much fun and I couldn’t put it down.","Rollerdrome is an unbelievably fun single-player experience that hasn’t quite reached its full potential. The explosive gunplay and roller-skating trickery are complemented by the picturesque yet bleak world all realised in a graphic novel art style. However, improvements can be made with some of the enemy types, bosses, and the inclusion of other competitors. Despite room for growth, this game is clearly being made by one hell of a talented team and Rollerdrome proves to be one hell of a shooter.",,,"Rollerdrome is an action game smartly mixed rollerskating and shooting. While the fast, exciting action and retro style OST are impressive, relatively scarce volumes and cartoon rendered visuals can be divided into likes and dislikes.",,,,"Roll7's atypically spectacular shooter is pure kinetic energy, ""held back"" by a certain inertia in form and content.",,"Rollerdrome immediately clicked with me, and I ate it all up. As polished and fun as the experience is, it feels like Roll7 is just dipping its toes into the water. I hope this talented studio gets the chance to make a sequel to further flesh out this unique concept with more detail in the story and greater player progression. Regardless, Rollerdrome is a fantastic first foot forward. I adored the campaign gameplay and have a feeling my friend group will use this unique title for late-night scoring competitions.",,,,,,,"When everything comes together, Rollerdrome feels incredible, but too often, things get buried under the weight of its many systems. While even at its worst, there is definitely fun to be had here, this feels like an incredible concept for a game where the developers needed to spend a little more time workshopping what aspects of it were really needed. It’s still a good game, though, and the foundation is in place for a sequel to be truly incredible.",,,,,,,,,"Blending the momentum of an extreme sport with the action of a third-person shooter, Rollerdrome creates a unique experience that will resonate with those who love to chase a high score.",,,,,,"Fast-paced, challenging, and visually pleasing, Rollerdrome is a game that deserves all the praise heaped upon it. Strap on your skates and load up those pistols, it’s time to dive into this brilliant skater-shooter.",,,,,,,,,"Rollerdrome produces some badass moments with its combination of X Games action and bullet-time violence, but it doesn’t replicate what made the OlliOlli games such Zenlike fun. Those looking for a challenge will find it here, but given Rollerdrome’s bland presentation, imperfect controls, and grueling approach to level design, many players will quickly skate on to something else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
call-of-duty-warzone-20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No need to go overboard: Warzone 2.0 is an excellent sequel that builds on the very good foundations of its predecessor. Above all, this is not a simple update. The new battle royale opts for a more tactical and ""realistic"" approach to loot, playing perfectly in concert with other new features (proximity chat, areas with several circles, bases guarded by AI, etc.). As a result, the experience is renewed and still very effective, thanks to a great game engine and top-notch shooting sensations. Finally, we just have a few reservations about artificial intelligence, which should be reviewed, especially given its new importance in games, and for the famous DMZ mode, which still lacks a lot of challenges at the moment. For the rest, it's free and it's an excellent game. Let's go!",,"Warzone 2.0 tries to cater to a wider audience by borrowing ideas from its competition, but it delivers a hodgepodge of ideas that seems to forget what made the original Warzone so iconic.",,"It appears Warzone 2 is off to a very solid start. It’s worth mentioning there are some technical issues, with Al Mazrah’s huge map taking a little while to load, and the occasional stuttering (mainly on PC), but all-in-all, it feels more stable than Warzone 1 did during its rougher periods. Al Mazrah might just be 2023’s hottest destination if this early taste is anything to go by.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Aside from the perspiration provided by an initial landing at a crowded point of interest, or the jaw-clenching moments of the final circle, the pace of play is deliberate, allowing players to think, look around and take advantage of the battleground in clever and effective ways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, Call of Duty Warzone 2.0 is a better product than its predecessor in almost every respect. The gameplay takes advantage of the small additions of the latest Modern Warfare 2, the positioning of the loot is finally believable and the DMZ mode, despite being in Beta, already looks promising right now. At present, Warzone 2.0 has some gameplay imperfections and numerous technical problems that affect the experience both when navigating the menus and within the game itself. We hope that the situation will improve in the coming weeks, so as not to overshadow the excellent work done by the Activision teams in packaging this experience of absolute importance for Call of Duty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Warzone 2.0 is the necessary modernization of the still entertaining Battle Royale variant of Call of Duty. DMZ as an extraction mode is a successful extension.,,,,,"Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 is a free-to-play shooter that innovates and renews the gaming experience of the previous chapter, adding many new features and changes especially focused on gameplay. The result is certainly good, even if it lacks in originality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Warzone 2 comes out swinging with the strongest map yet, as Al Mazrah's design is both visually appealing and well-balanced to encourage more moment-to-moment action and player movement. The sequel tosses in enough new features and changes to make gameplay feel fresh and give a dramatic change to the game's pace to set Warzone 2 apart from the original, and these battle royale matches are still a blast, despite the setbacks to classic features. Packaged with DMZ, which feels like a sandbox hit, free-to-play Call of Duty players have so many more ways to jump into the action and level up this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Thanks to solid foundations of the first game, as well as mostly successful changes and new features, Warzone 2.0 is one of the best multiplayer games on the market.

the-king-of-fighters-xv,,,,,"In a world where competitors like Mortal Kombat 11 and Guilty Gear Strive are making great strides in presentation and content, it’s hard to feel like KoF XV is keeping pace. It’s still an excellent fighter and KoF is one of the most reliable franchises out there. However, for an installment that promised to ‘shatter all expectations’ in the publicity leading up to launch, the final product seems content to barely meet them — a real shame since the fighting is still some of the best out there.",,"The King of Fighters XV seems to be extremely loyal to its philosophy by not making much effort to make the experience more appealing to a wider range of fighting players, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing, but if you are looking for another Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter, you’ll probably be disappointed.",,,,,,"SNK has finally delivered another King Of Fighters worthy of the modern era. Not only have they rectified past errors, they have refined the experience to be the most functional and accessible that King Of Fighters has been for years. With a polished graphical presentation, generous amount of content, and online play that works at the standard required, fans of the series can be very happy with this offering. In many ways, King Of Fighters XV is merely a tidier version of its predecessor, and whilst there's nothing wrong with that, you could still argue the series still has some ground to make up in the fighting scene. However, it is certainly a big step in the right direction, and a great Fighter for fans to sink their teeth into.",,,,,"It is not a revolution, but a good evolution of the good things from XIV, well equipped with improved visuals and rollback netcode to make sure it finds its way in the fighting community.",,,,,,"KOF XV is a heck of a fighting game that spans a massive, rich history. Personally, I would have loved a bigger focus on local play, and less-to-no focus on online multiplayer, but I get that it’s 2022 and fighting games can’t survive that way. As is, the local, offline offerings are pretty slim; fun, and serviceable, but pretty slim. Netcode and presentation are solid. I thought the graphical choices SNK went with for KOF XV were great. All-in-all, there’s a lot to like about this release. I’m not sure what SNK plans for paid DLC, but suspect there will be more than thirty-nine fighters in the roster when it’s all said and done. At release, KOF XV is technically sound on all fronts and fun to play. It’s great to see this series still getting serious attention from SNK, and hopefully the fighting community will be moved to support this classic franchise.","For a lot of fighting game fans, The King of Fighters 15 is exactly what they’ve been looking for - a no frills fighter that focuses on its mechanics and doesn’t hold the player's hand. In a generation where most games in the genre have five-hour campaigns from day one, it’s an admirable stance to take. As much as I love how KoF 15 plays and looks, I can’t help but miss the bells and whistles that are expected. If you’re looking for a fighter that shrugs off that expectation, then the King of Fighters 15 is absolutely for you.",,"I do admire the developer's desire to maintain the arcade fighter tone and aesthetic in King of Fighters, and I'll forever be a fan of this series as long as they keep dropping Athena into it. The team at SNK are no doubt working on more limited budgets than the big guns, and with the absolute focus on esports in the fighting game space it's no surprise that they've made that a near-perfect experience, even as they've stripped almost everything else out of the game to make that happen. However, there's no way to paper over this; people who do like fighting games in single player or local multiplayer are going to be left feeling very cold, though. Colder than Kula, even. And that's disappointing.","While the single-player offerings are decidedly paltry, the game's tweaked and revised mechanics along with its superbly gratifying presentation deliver in spades with an impressive roster that will only get stronger over time with at least 12 characters coming to the title as DLC. It is then that the lack of single-player content stings ever so slightly more, but with the incredibly smooth online experience offered by the title's rollback netcode, players will find plenty of reasons to return again and again.","The King of Fighters XV is among the best entries in the series, but it somehow feels stuck in the 90s. There are great multiplayer possibilities on one hand, and bare-boned single-player content with lack of motivation on the other.",,,,,"The King of Fighters XV represents SNK’s strongest efforts to reignite the flames of its most prestigious franchise. With fantastic fighting action, a compelling roster, splendid visuals, and revamped online options, KoF XV is a treat for both series veterans and the fighting game community at large, though newcomers may still find themselves dizzied by its myriad mechanics and steep learning curve.",,,,,"What’s important is that King of Fighters remains an exciting fighting game in XV. Visual style aside, the roster continues to be full of varied characters with interesting movesets, and the underlying mechanics make its matches fast-paced, explosive, and great to watch or play.","It’s a shame that The King of Fighters XV doesn’t have some of the modes we’ve come to expect as standard now in fighting games, but thanks to its large roster of fighters and solid mechanics it still impresses. Its team-based battles differentiate it a little from the competition out there, and on PS5 it looks and performs beautifully. So, if you’re on the market for a new fighting game, you should definitely give it a look. Especially if you plan on mainly playing against others online.","King of Fighters XV delivers an excellent fighting game that will appeal to beginners and pros alike. Instantly accessible, the training tools will allow players to go as deep as they like on learning mechanics. Beautiful and deliriously fun - if every game in the series has been as good as this one, I've been missing out.",,"King of Fighters XV is a delight. It feels like a new dawn for a legendary series, and I am genuinely excited to try out some of the future DLC characters that are on their way over the course of the year.",,,"It's a clear improvement from KOF XIV. This installment establishes itself as one of the most complete, accessible fighting games, without sacrificing its essence.","The King of Fighters XV is the greatest release in the series rich history. With its fluid and deep combat, veterans can compete in thrilling and intense battles. However, SNK has also included numerous elements that make the game accessible to support newcomers to the franchise. Whilst there aren’t many unlockables, the game shines in the arena, making this a necessity for fans of the genre.",,,"The King of Fighters XV improves on what was presented in its predecessor, especially the graphics and the online netcode. However, the absence of some classic fighters is notable. And mechanically speaking, don't expect anything too different from KOF XIV.","The King of Fighters XV may not be the best fighting game of the current generation of consoles, and it may not have the best graphics or visual style ever seen in the fighting game market, but it is certainly a fun game that will give fans enough reason to kill the nostalgia of the good arcade times. Its classic and new characters do the trick to bring lively and fierce disputes above all, especially with online modes that work and will make the battles pay for many hours.",,,,,"With its familiar, deep gameplay and recognizable characters, The King of Fighters 15 is an obvious success for fans of the franchise. However, in terms of accessibility and presentation, this new part is not convincing enough to stand out from the competition. The game will therefore not gain many new souls.",,,"The King of Fighters XV is great game with awesome animations and deep systems, but it lacks beginner friendly, or any form of, learning tools to let newer players get in the game.",,,"The King of Fighters XV is far from the perfection, but it has more highs than lows. The roster is huge, the mechanics are better and gameplay is pretty fun. But the visuals are not on the same level as the main games of the generation and the Story Mode is really bad. So, if you just want to fight with your friends and have a good time, go for it. But if you want a deeper experience, this ain't it.",,,,"A noticeable upgrade from its predecessor, King of Fighters 15 provides another classic SNK experience with some added changes that make the game feel new without making it feel drastically different. It’s a safe move, sure, but it preserves what makes the game such a classic arcade experience and still manages to provide newcomers something to help them ease into the technicality the series is known for.",The visual style is really great and that is complimented by excellent physics together with the almost sublime gameplay. The roster is also very extensive and the feel of the franchise is no different in this new installment that every fan of the genre should play. Do take into account that the presentation in itself is somewhat simplistic and the content outside of the fighters is somewhat disappointing.,,"Fighting game fans can't really go wrong with King of Fighters XV — a sequel that doesn't shy away from the technical depth of its predecessors. It's obviously still early days, but it feels like SNK has improved upon King of Fighters XIV in all of the ways that matter. Better visuals, expanded mechanics, and, perhaps most importantly, smooth online netcode make for fighter that's hard to fault — even if it's lacking the cutting edge of its peers.","The King of Fighters XV is accessible for newcomers, but at the same time, it adjusts some fighting mechanics so that the experience feels more aggressive. You'll enjoy it the most while playing online or with friends.",,,"There’s still room for improvement but this is the best King Of Fighters has been for many years, with enough new features to please both veterans and newcomers.","Excellence in gameplay, quality online mode, smooth execution... all the ingredients are there in this new generation fighting game! Fans of the latest installment should be thrilled, but we can't help but have some reservations about the art direction, content, and lack of life and inspiration in the sets. The King of Fighters has always been a franchise with a certain vibe, and it's perhaps a bit too generic to open up to the masses.",,"KOF’s resistance to any grand story arc defies the pressure being applied by its rivals. Minimal solo options and routine online duels don’t reinvent anything either. This isn’t laziness on SNK’s part, however. It feels more like a focus on maintaining the design philosophy that the player base has loved all along: potent character design, instantly identifiable team play, and off-the-wall plotlines.",,,The King of Fighters XV is a deep and articulated fighting game that requires time and dedication to be mastered but that can provide great satisfaction. The roster is rich and varied and the technical sector is rather pleasant: we are facing one of the best exponents of the genre currently available on the market.,,,"Taking up the basics of the KOF XIV game system (which was a superb mix of the best 2D episodes), KOF XV never disappoints in terms of gameplay, with a depth rarely equaled. You obviously have to like the offensive game (quite the opposite of Street Fighter) and like this great mobility as well, which makes everything go very quickly.",,"It’s a good beat-’em-up, but there are many great ones you could be playing instead. If you’re after a little bit of SNK nostalgia, though, dive in. [Issue#12, p.86]",It's far from the standard quality of the best chapters of the KOF saga but works well in his playability. The roster needs some classic characters. Has roll-back netcode.,,,,,,,,,"This new entry is not an attempt to revolutionize the series, but to improve it, and it does succeed at that.",,"King of Fighters XV marks an excellent return for the series, modernising it at nearly every turn. While we await a story that’ll finally do justice to the characterful roster, it stakes a claim to SNK’s past with an eye firmly on the future.","The King of Fighters XV is as good as it gets and feels like a complete package even at launch. Sure, it may not reinvent the wheel for the genre, but it perfects its unique gameplay formula and easily offers the best character roster the series has ever seen. With robust online options, deep gameplay systems, and stellar and stylistic presentation featuring unforgettable music, this is one fighting game that will be in regular rotation on any gaming platform. What was once innovative in 1994 succeeds at feeling just as new and exciting in 2022.",,"Living up to its title, King of Fighters XV is a fantastic slice of 3D fighting action. Don’t worry if you’re not a long-time fan, there’s enough to get you started here. A massive cast of brawlers, plenty of styles to choose from, and a host of fighting modes make this worthy of fighting fan’s collection.",,,,,SNK keeps doing fighting games in its own way and it's the best choice for The King of Fighters.,,,,,"KOF XV is an excellent game for fans of the series as it offers great visuals and a deeper fighting system. However, it will hardly win the hearts of newcomers because of its steep learning curve.",,,,,"The King of Fighters XV still feels left in the past when it comes to its single player offerings, but what it lacks in ambition, it makes up in solid fundamentals and great netcode that make the online experience the best the series has ever seen.","Although in some respects it seems firmly stuck in the past, KOFXV is a nicer, tighter version of the previous edition with surprisingly good online mode.",,"KoF XV doesn’t make any radical changes to the past 14 titles, instead opting to refine and improve, making it easily the best title in the franchise but one that plays it safe just a little too much.","KOF XV is pretty great, especially at launch. It is responsive, it looks great, and it offers a large roster of characters. I would have liked more to do on my own. Especially since I’m a big fan of the characters and would like the Story mode to have more… well, story to it. But SNK clearly put a lot of work into getting it right, and it shows.",,,,,"The true test for The King of Fighters XV is going to come in the days ahead, as the game gets into the hands of the general public and we see how everything fares both online and in far larger pools of player-vs.-player matches. For now, I’m excited for KOF XV. Its gameplay feels solid, its roster is satisfying, and its overall visual design once again does the series justice. I just hope all of those things hold up once the real fight begins.",,,,,,"A good sequel to the historic saga, a robust and fun fighting game, although still with clear room for improvement.",,,,,"King of Fighters XV set out to “shatter all expectations” and met most of them instead. While a slightly hollow presentation sets its crown crooked, the game’s core is a solid engine and a diverse roster that will warrant longterm play.","KOF XV is a great game, but it lacks a bit of courage, that spark capable of revolutionizing the series. I don't expect a Copernican revolution like it was at the time of KOF ‘96, but SNK will have to come up with some new ideas for the next chapter.",,,"The King of Fighters XV is a knockout entry in SNK's flagship fighting game series. Smartly building upon the foundation of its predecessor, it ups the ante in subtle yet meaningful ways that should satisfy even the most discerning fans of the franchise.",,,,,,,,"It’s not perfect, it’s not easy to learn, and there are some characters missing that I feel are must-haves. However, a solid visual redesign, good netcode, original and returning music, a great collection of fighting mechanics, and a wide offering of tutorial and training tools make King of Fighters XV feel like one of the strongest entries in the franchise yet.",,"Most King of Fighters veterans and newbies looking for a new title to dive into probably won't care that KoF XV isn't shaking up the fighting game paradigm. It delivers fisticuffs that overflow with a unique style and personality unlike that of other fighting game series, and that's more than enough to satisfy a lot of players. The King is back, and personally, I'm glad to see SNK swinging strong yet again.",,"The King of Fighters XV is the return of a long running franchise, yet feels like it was just invented yesterday. A perfect blend of older and newer elements that make it the most pleasing overall package that fans haven't gotten from this franchise since the 2D pixel art days. The king has returned, and it's going to rule for a while.",,,,"While King of Fighters 15 might not have the appeal of games like Mortal Kombat 11 or Street Fighter 5, its complex web of systems provide a satisfying time when they are fully mastered. The story is rather generic and there’s a distinct lack of modes, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a lot to unpack when taking the fight to your opponents.",,,,,,,,"It makes me feel like I never left KOF behind, to begin with. I am ready to start my journey in fighting games once again and live to fight another day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The King of Fighters XV is a fantastic new entry in SNK's beloved series that builds on XIV with some excellent gameplay, great visuals, superb music, and robust online. It is however let down by the offline modes.",,"It may be more initially intimidating to genre newcomers than, say, Guilty Gear Strive or Dragon Ball FighterZ, but being fun to pick up yet challenging to master is the hallmark of any great fighting game. It’s part of the appeal, even, and when you take the consistently deep gameplay of KOF and combine it with greatly improved graphical presentation, solid rollback netcode, and mechanical changes that allow for more player freedom, you get something that truly does “shatter all expectations” as the tagline implies.",,,,"Pack your bags for South Town - KOF is back.

f1-22,,,"F1 2022 is a simulator with a straight objective. Clearly, Codemasters decided to bet on what it does best and abandon some interesting features for the casual player, in exchange for possibilities and seriousness whose appeal to enthusiasts makes the game a must-have Formula 1 fans.",,,,,,,"Another year, another F1, this time with almost no major changes, microtransactions, dysfunctional VR support and ridiculously bad supercars modes and additions. Yeah, the first EA-published Codemasters game had some of their notoriously bad practices inside of it, and even though it is no surprise, it is a sad day, since last year's edition was one of the best F1 experiences ever made.","Where it counts, F1 22 is right on track.",,,"Codemasters has once again excelled with the on-track action in F1 22, and the series still manages to cater to everyone from casual F1 fans to hardcore sim racers. However, its major off-track addition, F1 Life, misses the mark and comes across as a hollow feature.",,,"Those who get their kicks not from the numbers and tables of a management game, but from phenomenal speeds on the track should choose ‘F1 22’. The annual release of this racing game consistently ranks among the top and has recently received an update that added even more content.",,,,"In summary, if you are going to buy F1 you should keep in mind that this is not a delivery that innovates in any way. Nothing beyond having an improvement in the controls. Honestly, I would recommend waiting for a later discount to be able to play this installment of the franchise that it should seriously consider if it want to take a real step forward next year.",,,,,,,"Although this is far from Gran Turismo 7 when it comes to predatory monetization models, it's still a disappointing move for a series that has been at the top of its game for a few years. It's a hindrance, like porpoising on an otherwise brilliant F1 car, and it holds back what otherwise would have been an extremely exciting racing game.",,,,,,,,,,,,"For Formula One fans, it’s easier than ever to recommend F1 22. Significant changes have been made here to not only keep the game up to date, but also more immersive, more expansive and more fun. The only real disappointment is F1 Life, which feels a like a good idea in principle but very poorly executed. And of course, the lack of a story mode will be a let-down to some, too. Ultimately, F1 22 takes a couple of steps forward and couple back, but where it matters – in its gameplay and stellar career mode – it’s still very much at the front of the pack.",,,,"F1 22 is technically stunning, and that, combined with the chance to drive this year’s cars on this year’s tracks, should make it irresistible to Formula One fans. As long as they manage to ignore the egregious F1 Life.",,,,"F1 2022 is a return in style to the motor sport that we fell in love with more than 10 years ago with an outstanding technical and playable section. While it is true that if you are not a fan of Formula 1 you can get lost a little, those who most enjoy this discipline have everything to spend hours and hours inside the car, with a career mode that engages from the beginning and some Grand Prix that are the same from start to finish.","F1 2022 retains most of what made the previous game had, adding just enough to to satisfy most fans. With more time in the oven, it could have been nearly perfect. Still, the fear of EA control lingers.","F1 22 is, without a doubt, the best game of the franchise released so far. Visually beautiful, it is solid and polished in its mechanics on and off the track, offering precise gameplay adaptable to any type of player, providing a complete, challenging, and well-balanced experience of this sport.","With a deep and rich career mode, and the vast amount of assist and difficulty options, F1 22 remains the best racing game in the series, as well as being the most complete and accessible reproduction of a single modern motorsport in the market - not to mention that adjustments to some of its most reused elements also make a difference. This year's edition isn't quite as bold as F1 2021, though, and the F1 Life mode, frankly, with its focus on footwear and furniture, certainly isn't even a bandage to cover the lack of the F1's ambitious story mode from last year.",,"F1 22 is a must-play for fans of racing in general and Formula 1 in particular – if you've missed out on previous installments, it’s worth trying this one out. The amount of new content should surprise you and racing itself feels the best since at least F1 2014.",,,,"F1 continues to be one of the best racing simulations available to date.

F1 22 delivers exactly what we expect. And maybe that’s also a problem. Sometimes it feels like the same game over and over again, every year. F1 22 could’ve brought a New Era to the racing games, as EA Sports said it would, but unfortunately it’s just another entry of the series that is pretty good but doesn’t take it to another level.",,"F1 22 is without a doubt one of the best titles of the year in the racing sim world. Excellent graphics that take full advantage of the PS5 hardware power, the updated regulations, the new Immersive feature that makes it possible for gamers to control their cars when the Safety Car is on the track, and the pit stop experience overall, all make the game provide an even more realistic Formula One experience.",,,"F1 22 is a solid new installment in the franchise. This is because it offers more of what we already know. The improved physics do the gameplay good and the many modes provide enough variety. However, the major new addition in the game, F1 Life, is a disappointment, as it doesn't add anything really relevant and tends to microtransactions. The AI still pulls off weird stuff and it is graphically due for another step forward. It is and will remain a fine racing game, but it is time to take it to a new level.",,"Overall, F1 22 is another high quality simulation of the motorsport, with great handling and detailed, engrossing career modes. While the presentation is strong and the game generally looks and sounds great, some aspects like character models just aren't quite where they should be, and F1 Life doesn't add all that much to the experience. We encountered more bugs than expected, too, although we expect patches will iron those out in due course. It's got it where it really counts, then, but some extra polish would put it higher on the grid.",,,"The F1 series is starting to look more and more like FIFA. Bright colours, hip music and the first contours of what could become F1UT. This year I'm still meeting Codemasters (Codematsers!), but they have to counteract that EA nonsense. Just ask Lewis Hamilton how quickly things can go differently, in F1...","Brilliantly replicates the thrill of driving this year’s F1 cars and even the cynical F1 Life, and it’s awful microtransactions, can’t spoil the excitement.","With a second rolling start on PS5 and Xbox Series X, F1 22 has put some oil in its engine. A little more animation during the celebrations and on the track with the arrival of the safety car in the race, the addition of events with Supercars to drive and drops in FPS during less significant cutscenes than in 2021, the standing of the latest generation of consoles is finally respected. Codemasters has succeeded in making this new title a reference for multiplayer games with the adjustment to the new rules, the addition of sprint races and a new pit entry system. We will just grumble about the too superficial F1 Life space and the lack of inspiration on the content, but F1 22 is well worth it for new motorsport fans and multiplayer enthusiasts.",,,,,,"EA Sports F1 22 is another great outing for the series. Codemasters delivers on the track. Thanks to the changes in Formula 1, the game feels and plays different than last year. Adding Supercars and Pirelli Hotlaps fits the series well.",,,,"A familiar yet brilliant, career mode. However, supercars and F1 Life ‘content’ are throwaway, making this a less attractive proposition than F1 2021. [Issue#17, p.78]","F1 22 does what it has to do: it renews the new championship rules and makes the cars more realistic. Even so, it misses a more exciting mode than F1 Life and a more competitive multiplayer. [Recommended]",,,,,,,"What makes F1 22 great are the improvements to the core technical aspects. The new cars look and sound amazing as the game is buttery smooth across the board. The new physics with the new cars will challenge even the pros up front until they figure out their setups. The supercars on the Pirelli Hot Laps are fun to play around with, but I’m assuming that licensing issues prevented Codemasters from having a deeper implementation into the game. The point is a return is needed for classic cars and to add even more from different generations. Otherwise, the new additions are slight improvements, but underwhelming. The pit box integration is better than having nothing, but once that timing is down, it doesn’t amount to much. The limited gameplay mode selection and the reduction of major aspects does sting. I will give kudos to Codemasters for trying some new things and while nothing flopped, it was played safe. What matters most is what happens on the track and F1 22 offers the best racing the series has seen.",,,,,,,,"Even with a superfluous F1 Life and some odd bugs, F1 22 maintains its strong fundamentals while tightening up its racing and offering more options.",,"With the major changes to the sport rules and the beginning of the ""new era of Formula 1"" we expected more from this game. Despite this, F1 22 is still the best game for Formula 1 enthusiasts.","Porpoising aside, Codemasters did a good job of reproducing the regulation change that revolutionized the world of F1. Fun to play, impressive to watch, F1 22 stands out for its above average AI and a driving model that perfectly summarizes the concept of simcade.",,,,,,"Codemasters is taking something that was already great and trying to bring it into line with the modern reality of F1. Technically the title moves to incredible levels of quality, but unfortunately the impression is created that FIA's changes in the real life environment have not been translated so successfully to the corresponding digital one.",,"EA Sports F1 22 is simply the best possible virtual experience of Formula 1. From Free Practices to the Chequered Flag, it remains as responsive and balanced as the last few entries, nailing down the authenticity through additions such as the manual warm-up lap and new graphics and cutscenes. What stops it from being a truly great game is the awkward inclusion of F1 Life and some technical issues that require urgent fixing.",,,,"Transitional game - that is the easiest way to describe the state of the latest F1 game where Codemasters either didn't want to take the risk of adding a more ambitious game modes or they just didn't have time to prepare something like that in a year when the whole sport switched to a totally new form. Despite the lack of central campaign, F1 22 is still a game that can satisfy both newcomers and veterans alike with its still superb driving simulation and attractive presentation style.",,,,"With exciting new developments in the sport F1 22 has done well to keep up with the rules and regulations as well as giving players plenty of options to play with off the grid...If you’re intimately familiar with some of the quality of life changes introduced in F1 21,then the latest addition will give existing players plenty to look forward to and newcomers can comfortably settle into the seat before taking on more complex maneuvers and adjustments in their own time.",,"Playing in VR for the first time is a thrill, but the other new features haven’t been implemented well.",,,,,"F1 22 takes another step forward and surpasses everything we saw in the previous game, better graphics level and new modes to improve the experience.

I can say that F1 22 is one of the most outstanding racing games that have been released this year.",,,,,,,,"A fine entry to the popular F1 series, F1 22 brings some new things to the table, but suffers from control issues and a lack of things to do.","F1 22 manages to improve on last year’s game by evolving its driving model based on the new Formula 1 regulations. Unfortunately this happened to the detriment of the amount of content present in this iteration. Right now we have a foot in the new era, but the other is still in the past.",,,,,"With prettier graphics and notably improved physics, F1 22 impresses right out of the gate. Last year's enjoyable story mode is unfortunately gone, and instead we get to play F1 star with luxury watches and clumsy supercars. What a downgrade. Fortunately, the presentation, the career mode and not least the driving experience are better than ever.",,,,,,,,"It makes sense that, in a year where Formula 1 has changed so much, most of the focus for F1 22 has gone into replicating the slew of regulation changes in order to provide the expected authentic racing experience the series has come to be known for. In that regard, F1 22 delivers, offering up a satisfyingly challenging way to wrestle these extreme racing machines around every track on the Formula 1 calendar. It's in the omissions and lackluster additions where F1 22 falters somewhat, with less content than last year's entry and a paid battle pass-like system that locks away many cosmetic items behind a paywall.. It's a few rare missteps for a series that has been consistently great for so long, but thankfully it delivers in the high-octane action on track, where it matters most.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It goes beyond what many fans thought and adds an excellent documentation job, bringing lost content to a wider audience which, maybe, would never know about its existence. If you are a person who likes all these nostalgic feelings, this is a must have compilation.

For the case of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, it is so easy to relive the glory days of arcade gaming be it in playing any of the thirteen titles it offers OR by perusing the sheer amount of extra content in the Turtle’s Lair. And, having online play that works with little issues is the cherry on top. As a fan of TMNT, the Cowabunga Collection is a no-brainer: This is the collection best shared over pizza.","Whether you’re a fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or not, the Cowabunga Collection is without a doubt the most impressive gaming compilation there’s ever been.

And while there are some games here that are still enjoyable, there are others that we can’t imagine anyone genuinely having a fun time with. Still, as retro collections go, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – The Cowabunga Collection is comprehensive, and you can’t fault that. Add in all the fan-pleasing extras and you have a collection that is sure to find an audience despite its shortcomings.","We now live in a world where we have a brand new TMNT game, and the granddaddy of them all, with 12 of his other children. Between the Gallery, the enhancements, the different types of games, and online play, you can't beat the $40 price tag. These games will keep you busy and give you a history lesson at the same time.

Your childhood deserves it.",,"There is much to see and do with The Cowabunga Collection, and whilst the games are arguably all eclipsed by the recent Dotemu reboot, there are still some blinding retro classics and so many extras to enjoy that this collection is a great value trip through your childhood console and arcade memories.",,,"To put it simply: TMNT The Cowabunga Collection sets the new standard for retro compilation video games. A great selection of titles and an astounding amount of extras makes this, as the turtles would call it, a ""very cowabunga game"".","I’m not sure how I feel about this collection. I didn’t enjoy most of the games I played. And yet, this release does an admirable job gathering up so much Turtles history and memorabilia. You’ve got the games, the box art, the concept sketches, the music, and the TV stills. You have a clear snapshot of the Turtles hype train running at full speed. The effect is so complete this collection feels like a curated museum exhibit. On the other hand, the games are mostly bad. The action is repetitive, the difficulty balance is busted, and the stage design is mostly an afterthought. If you’re looking for a thoughtful essay on Ninja Turtles history, then look no further.

While not every game is a winner — and a lot of them are variants of other games in the collection — there's still lots here to love. It brings two of the most beloved beat-'em-ups in history to modern platforms, and is host to some hidden gems like Radical Rescue. This is all polished up with a host of great enhancements and the fantastic Turtle Lair gallery, which — for any TMNT fan — may be worth the price of admission alone.","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is a pretty solid collection that celebrates the classic games of the franchise.

Despite its status as a “simple” compilation, the work of the Digital Eclipse studio is a lesson for all publishers who bring out the old things of the past. If the 13 games do not show the same interest, we can only bow to the avalanche of options and bonuses integrated into this compilation. Admittedly, some productions have aged and the lifespan is not enormous, but the user-friendliness is there and in the field of compilations, this Cowabunga Collection holds the dragee high for the tenors of the genre. In such conditions, it is difficult not to be seduced.",,,,"TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection brings together over a dozen games from the past onto retro consoles with fantastic execution, and manages to do so with all the flare and humor fans have come to expect from the series.","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is a generous package full of nostalgia, Thirteen games from the Arcade, 8-16 bit and Game Boy eras and tons of gaming options, cheats and extras.",,,,,"Turtles In Time, in both its original arcade and SNES forms, is the biggest draw here, but the package pulls together multiplayer and single-player games from arcade, SNES, Mega Drive, NES, and Game Boy.

It’s retro bliss.

Just pure nostalgia.",,"Although inconsistent in game quality, if you are looking for the ultimate TMNT package, it's here.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is a love letter to fans of that era that can be equally appreciated by old and new generations of Turtles fans alike.,,,,,,,"The entire TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection has clearly been crafted by a team that loves the TMNT – not just the games, but the shows and comics as well. It’s not only full of some of the best Ninja Turtle games ever made (and also the other ones), but the team at Digital Eclipse has gone above and beyond by adding a treasure trove of unique Ninja Turtles art & other creations. They’re also chock full of options, cheat codes, new features, and behind-the-scenes images. It’s truly unfortunate that the online component makes it so hard to find a match, and when you do get into a game it’s often woefully laggy. The input delay could also be improved. That said, this is still the most complete TMNT game collection available. If you’re feeling nostalgic for this era of Turtles gaming and don’t feel like spending nearly $550 on eBay to get the originals – plus all the time and effort of getting a retro gaming setup up and running – this is one shell of a collection.","A top-notch collection full of TMNT titles from various retro systems and arcades - the games may be of varying quality, but many options and mods, quality of life improvements, and tons of bonus content make this compilation one of the best yet.",,,,,,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is dripping with admiration for the franchise, and immortalises these games with astounding polish.","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is a well-presented time capsule of classics, porting its beloved titles not only without lag but with modern-day improvements and a smorgasbord of extras to boot.

For fans of the series, it's a dreamlike time machine that takes you back to the golden days of Ninja Turtles.",,,,,,,,,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Cowabunga Collection is a trophy to bury for hours for someone like me who is a fan of old series and games.,,,,,,"To finally have proper, unspoiled versions of TMNT Arcade and Turtles in Time that I can play whenever I want without having to spend hundreds on a replica arcade machine makes the TMNT: Cowabunga Collection worth it alone. Everything else is a welcome bonus.",,,,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is an overdose of nostalgia for me. I grew up with TMNT constantly on the brain. These games are a treat to revisit mostly because of the quality of life updates the developers have added. I just spent an entire day digging back into all of it. Playing through both arcade games, and of course watching the video of someone beating the dam level, because I cannot do that. This collection is outstanding and I cannot wait for their release of the 50th Anniversary of Atari later this year.","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection serves up ample old-school gameplay nostalgia, though it’s appeal it limited.",,"Of the 13 games in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, five or six of them are of legitimate quality and stand up to the type of scrutiny that a modern palette demands.

[Issue#353, p.121]",,,"Sackboy A Big Adventure goes out if its way to be a Nintendo-like platformer, and almost gets it right if not for a few small but costly mistakes. It's still a very good game, but could have even been better if the developers focused more on their own ideas.","Despite being a game with consistent quality and performance, Sackboy: A Big Adventure can’t quite escape being run-of-the-mill when compared to its contemporaries. There is still plenty of that LittleBigPlanet charm to be found throughout this lengthy, platforming campaign though. It’s gorgeous to look at, it’s well-designed and the game feel is just right. However, if you are looking for some of that next-gen innovation on par with Astro’s latest, then you may struggle to find it here.","While not on the same level as Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Demon's Souls, this launch title is still a banger and a very good platformer, even though it has its numerous shortcomings.",,,,"An astounding triumph of imagination, Sackboy: A Big Adventure isn't just one of the best platformers ever made, it's also a proper highlight of the PlayStation 5 launch line-up that is steeped in such fun and free wheeling creativity, that it deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as other PlayStation platforming heroes such as Jak & Daxter and Ratchet & Clank.",,Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a very entertaining platformer and a varied game with beautiful levels and strong design. It also takes a good advantage of DualSense unique capabilities.

A must have for the PS5.,"With Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Demon’s Souls dominating the PS5’s launch lineup this season it would be very easy to overlook Sackboy: A Big Adventure. I’m here to try to make sure that doesn’t happen, as it satisfies that family friendly, co-operative platforming adventure quota, and it’s definitely a colorful, creative and enjoyable next-generation adventure worth taking.","Sackboy: A Big Adventure is an easy recommendation to fans of the platforming genre or anyone looking for a co-op game to play on their new PS5 console. While it would be nice to see a proper LittleBigPlanet 4 come to Sony's next-generation system, hopefully, fans can look forward to future Sackboy platforming adventures as well.",Sackboy: A Big Adventure is incredible — solo or with others. It has an amazing amount of content for a game that most will write-off haphazardly. It’s an example of fun creativity that comes with people who are passionate about bringing a good experience to gamers of all ages.,"Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a decent platforming game that’s stuffed with charm, if a little lacking in imagination, which is a shame for a franchise built on creativity. Saying that, if you’ve got children, this is a must-buy for some family-friendly PS5 fun.","In the rush of next-gen hype, I hadn't expected Sackboy: A Big Adventure to be the game that grabbed my heart (and my strained attention) in a big warm hug and didn't let go, but it's just hours of pure happiness. I don't care if you're nine or ninety, or a ghost who hangs around the living room, you can't help but be won over by it. Even when you're done with the story, there are so many reasons to go back in just to try and ace a level, or beat your time in a Knight trial, or keep adding to your costumes, or to try some offline co-op with a friend. If you're a hardened gamer who is more interested in the brutality of Demon's Souls or the street swinging of Spider-Man: Mile Morales, know that Sackboy can hold his own with both of them and deserves a place in your PS5 must play list.","I don't want to take anything away from Sackboy: A Big Adventure. Platformers are one of the genres I am least inclined towards, and were it not part of a (fairly limited) launch range on the PlayStation 5, I might not have been inclined to play Sackboy at all. I am glad that I did, though, because for pure whimsy and quality level design it's a real challenge to Nintendo at its best in this genre, and that's no mean feat. Just don't go in expecting the same qualities that made the LittleBigPlanet series itself so beloved.",,,"Sackboy doesn’t have the tight movement tech of Crash Bandicoot 4 or the butter-melting charms of a game like Astro’s Playroom, but it’s well worth a look if you’re in the market for an innovative platformer that makes the most of the PS5’s exclusive features.","Sackboy stars in a fun adventure that, given the nature of the gameplay, at times tends to become repetitive. Nevertheless, we are dealing with a game worthy of such a popular character that the lovers of platform-games will enjoy.","Sackboy is not groundbreaking in any way, but it doesn’t need to be. It’s a wonderful platformer that looks great, sounds excellent, and offers superb co-op.

Competent if not revolutionary platforming propels Sackboy through a stunning world full of fun set pieces and clever writing, while an approachable challenge level opens the experience to all skill levels.

You can buy this without thinking twice if you have kids. But young and old are going to enjoy A Big Adventure. Take the traditional platforms for granted now and then and you will get a big smile in return.,,"Sackboy: A Big Adventure is the hessian hero's best outing yet. Tighter platforming controls and a fresh perspective go a long way to reinvigorating the franchise, and it helps that the whole thing is positively stuffed with charm from beginning to end. Levels that feel lonely when played solo, and worse, levels that aren't accessible at all in single player dampen the experience, but not enough for platforming fans to dismiss it. If you've just brought home a shiny new PlayStation 5 there's also a lot here to showcase what the console is capable of in both visuals and the user experience, making it well worth considering as part of your launch library.

It doesn't matter if you move to the new generation: if you like platform games, you have to play it.",,"Don't overlook this joyous explosion of colour and charm - I very nearly did, and I'm kicking myself for it. [Eurogamer Recommended]",,"For those with cleaner children than mine, Sackboy: A Big Adventure is exactly the sort of non-threatening video game that’s perfect for family game night.

As a complete experience, though, Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a fun platforming adventure that’ll leave you with a smile on your face.",,"A Big Adventure is a big surprise. A fantastic platformer that gets better the more you play it, and becomes a fantastic choice to inaugurate your PS5.",Sackboy: A Big Adventure is dripping with charm and makes excellent use of the DualSense controller.,"Sackboy: A Big Adventure starts off slow, feeling like a hollow reflection of the franchise, but eventually grows into its new 3D platforming elements. It's at its best when it blends the new with the old, when there's power-ups, side-scrolling and a meaningful challenge, but it takes a bit too long to get it together.",,,,,,A good platform game for the whole family that fits perfectly in the PS5 line up.,"Ultimately, Sackboy is a straightforward and genuine platformer, “tailor-made” for fans of the genre.","Sackboy is a smart and colorful platform game, filled with fun moments and loyal to its LittleBigPlanet’s roots.",,,"Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a great platformer filled with charming levels, fun combat, and a lot of challenges to complete.",,"An ideal game for family fun through its co-op mode and the overall low challenge and charming aesthetic. This is not a LittleBigPlanet sequel, but a quite pleasing, diverse and lengthy 3D platformer that shows the power of the PS5 in its own, cute way.",,,"Sackboy: A Big Adventure isn’t the most attention-grabbing PS5 launch title. It’s fair to say it’s been completely overshadowed by Demon’s Souls and Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but it offers a wonderfully crafted alternative to what are more mature titles. Sony is on a roll with the PS5, with Sackboy: A Big Adventure being yet another title PS5 buyers should seriously consider adding to their collection.",,"A Big Adventure is a lovely spin-off of LittleBigPlanet that’s filled with charming sights and sounds alike. Its level designs are adorable and creative, really shining in co-op but still entertaining when played alone. Its platforming can occasionally frustrate, falling short of the precision and nuance needed to really make it stand out from other games like it, but the feel-good vibe that permeates every corner of its crafted world still makes it a joy to play.",,,"Sackboy: A Big Adventure, is a big step in a fresh direction for the overall franchise. Leaving the tried and true ‘Play, Create, Share’ model behind is a gutsy move from Sumo Digital, but is one that greatly benefits the final product, with each level clearly benefiting from the extra TLC that comes from not dedicating time to an all-consuming creation mode.",,,,,,"Ultimately, I’m not sure if Sackboy: A Big Adventure will go down as the most memorable title in the PlayStation 5’s lineup. (Indeed, it’s also available on the PS4, though I can’t speak to that version at all.) I’m also skeptical the realignment away from LittleBigPlanet will help Sackboy join the likes of Mario and Sonic as true platforming icons. But there’s no question fans of the genre will find a lot to love here—and plenty of it.","You like jump&runs and find the world of Little Big Planet adoring? Then there is no way, you should pass this game by. On PS5 the visuals are crisp, while audiohaptic feedback enhances this charming platformer.",,,"Sackboy: A Big Adventure doesn't offer too much challenge but what it does offer is great level design, fantastic music, and a plethora of objectives for the completionists out there. This all adds up to a level of charm that can rival even the best of Nintendo platformers.",A fun and well designed platformer that lacks the charm to make a long standing impact. You should try it if you want a good and family friendly game for PlayStation.,"Sumo Digital's new game is a colorful and fun adventure that brings back Sackboy, allowing players to explore new worlds, each based on different themes and gameplay mechanics. A great game for Christmas to spend some time along with your family, thanks to the 4-player co-op mode.",,"The visual upgrade on PS5 is hard to ignore, with Sumo Digital displaying a mastery of recreating materials. Subtle and impressive lighting effects add an additional layer of believably to physical objects such as fabric, metals, and other surfaces – and even the nearly invisible wisps of fuzz on Sackboy’s head. Even though the fidelity isn’t quite as sharp on PS4, a strong overall aesthetic direction makes it still look appealing on the aging hardware. DualSense implementation makes for another strong case to play on PS5 if at all possible. The controller’s haptics and adaptive triggers are put to great use, mimicking the sensation of walking on different surfaces and hoisting heavy objects. Regardless of what version you pick up, you’ll be setting off on a joyous and satisfying journey. But if you have a choice, the PS5 version is the clear winner here.",,,"At the end of its yarn, Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a fun romp through a craft-inspired world that feels as if it was cut from the same cloth as something like Yoshi’s Crafted World, rather than LittleBigPlanet, however, this is not a bad thing, especially for those looking for a traditional platforming experience. Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a content-rich platformer that can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of age and is a worthy addition to the PlayStation 5 launch line-up.","Sackboy: A Great Adventure is perhaps the real surprise of the PS5 debut. A solid platformer as expected from Sumo, which knows where to draw inspiration from and how to reinvent it, as if they were true game design restorers. Simple and very smooth from start to finish, but a good challenge to bring to full completion, with all its collectibles and challenges that enhance a level design that is not at all trivial and that always strives to do something different to make each stage a unique gaming experience.",,,,,"Sackboy: A Big Adventure switches the creative mode from the main series to a more direct platform game. Some courses such as the rhythm-based ones are brilliant, but despite the improved control compared to Little Big Planet, most of them are too easy and slow for the experienced player. And apart from the Dual Sense features, there are no real ""next gen"" details that stand out.",,,,"Although its lack of online multiplayer at launch is disappointing, Sackboy: A Big Adventure is still a charming platformer. Going through each of its stages is a pleasure. Collecting things and dressing up is delightful, and multiplayer is a lot of fun if you have friends around. It may not be the most ambitious title to feature Sackboy, but what's here is nothing short of jolly.",,"When it comes to gameplay and story, it is fair to say that we’ve seen it all before, and usually done better. The main appeal here is to rehash old material with a 4K, leather-and-corduroy-upholstered refresh. If that sounds like a good time, Sackboy is sure to please, but it will leave other PS5 owners wondering when next-gen will actually show up.",,"Sackboy is a solid platformer and, despite its rote art style, makes great use of the PS5's enhanced visual and technical performance. It's a fun little romp of a platformer, with lots of interesting moments. At times, the visual design can look a bit flat. Even in those moments, though, the tight controls and interesting level layouts create gameplay challenges that make those flaws easy to overlook.","Sackboy: A Big Adventure is beautiful and the added power of the PlayStation 5 hardware has led to the materials found throughout the arts-and-craft world to look and often behave like the real thing. The blend of fantasy with everyday objects gels wonderfully with the soundtrack too, giving the experience a feel that is more than a simple riff on classic 3D platforming.",,"Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a charming game that I was smiling while playing almost entirely. It will likely get lost amonth after the Spider-Man and Astro Bot mainstays, but this game is more than worth checking out. Especially for those looking for something to play with their family and friends. It is a whimsical adventure that finally makes me enjoy a game featuring Sackboy, and that is a win in and of itself.","After a six-year absence, PlayStation’s knitted icon returns in stunning form in one of the year's best platformers. With an A-list cast, superb visuals, and some strong co-op gameplay, Sackboy: A Big Adventure successfully proves that Sackboy can thrive without LittleBigPlanet’s creation mechanics, all while still paying homage to his roots.",A brilliantly accessible and clever platformer with a top-notch soundtrack.

life-is-strange-true-colors---wavelengths,,,,,"As I mentioned in my original review, the reason True Colors stuck with me were the lessons I learned after finishing it — I learned that time heals all wounds, and that I should let go of problems now, instead of letting them fester. Wavelengths gave me another character doing the same, with fresher wounds and even heavier emotional baggage. As a prequel, knowing Steph’s fate from the beginning made her emotional growth feel even more rewarding, and reminded me that things will get better. It just takes work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In the end, players will leave with two things: some great music recommendations and the craving to play Life is Strange: True Colors once again, especially if they wooed Steph while in the shoes of Alex Chen, if nothing else but to see her finally get the wholesome romance she deserves. Overall, it's only a short piece of Steph's life, to connect the dots between Before the Storm and Alex's story in True Colors, but it adds some context to her grounded attitude towards trauma and the decision she eventually makes to leave Haven Springs. Steph feels a bit out of place as a lesbian in a rural town, and she still desires the thrilling life of an indie band. Wavelengths provides the middle to Before the Storm's beginning and True Colors' end of the Steph Gingrich saga.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite the soundtrack’s chill vibes, you’ll want to keep the tissues close for this one.

Steph's story is quite emotionally intense and will appeal to fans of the first chapter of the series especially, but it stumbles on the playful front. In about two and a half hours of duration, in fact, the expansion reiterates some game mechanics too much, making them monotonous and not very varied. An additional content that remains a welcome and exciting tribute to the protagonists of the first LIS, and that at the same time is effectively linked to the incipit of True Colors, from which however we also expected something more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Life is Strange: True Colors has received DLC in the form of Wavelengths which, as this review reveals, is a calm yet enjoyable slice-of-life experience that focuses on Steph Gringrich.

Warm and sweet, Steph coming-of-age story, made of records and dies is a welcome missing link between the first Life is Strange and True Colors.",,,,,,,,,"Life is Strange: True Colors remains one of my favorite titles of 2021. Wavelengths isn’t everything I wanted when it comes to DLC. Being able to explore Haven Springs further, or at least bringing more of Haven Springs into the record store, would have provided a more satisfying experience.

Of course, the loss of the smaller battles in between means that there’s no opportunity to level your character up if you’re struggling, but the short and sharp nature of the fights on offer, and the ease of which you can respec to try a different approach, makes up for that somewhat. It’s a just a shame that Eldest Souls sometimes feels unfair, with victory being the result of your foes not making use of certain powerful skills.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As a game Eldest Souls does not hide the fact it is a tough game but it is trying to outshine in a genre that has had better examples, and better bosses over the years.

While the game only features ten boss fights, it’ll easily take players about a dozen hours to make their way through the story.

Taking in the beauty around me at all times was a treat in this game and I liked the interactivity Guerrilla and Firesprite implemented in this experience. I liked bonking drums and throwing pottery around as much as I liked assembling fire arrows and shooting them into a machine’s opticals. I wish the game didn’t rely so much on climbing, but even in that, it provides a pretty intense and immersive experience. The game isn’t without hiccups, and it won’t give you the same vast freedom the mainline games do, but Horizon Call of the Mountain is still a breathtaking VR adventure, a fun side chapter in Horizon lore, and a great kickoff to the PS VR2’s original lineup of games.",,"The ongoing refrain of ""familiar done well"" is the defining quality of Call of the Mountain. There's nothing revolutionary in the game that moves VR gaming forward and it doesn't do anything unexpected, so it ends up being exactly what it looks like: a well-made Horizon game in VR that has good climbing and shooting, as well as pretty environments to look at. As a showcase of what can be done with the PSVR 2, it more than handily serves its purpose.",,,,,,,"Horizon Call of the Mountain works as an impressive PSVR2 tech showcase, but overambitious ideas make it less appealing as an action-adventure game.",,,,"Call of the Mountain certainly isn’t the kind of interactive theme park ride that plenty of early VR titles offered. But it feels like it was either sanded down to avoid alienating VR newcomers, or its designers weren’t given the resources to fully realize its potential. All I can do is wonder what might have been — and maybe play some of those boss fights a few more times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Horizon Call of the Mountain showcases Sony's shiny new hardware very well taking you on an entertaining and varied romp through the lesser known parts of the Horizon universe, but it isn't a system seller.","Horizon Call of the Mountain is not only a showcase of PS VR2 capabilities, but also a great adventure. Open world of this well-known brand has been transferred to virtual reality in a successful and highly imaginative way.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Horizon Call of the Mountain takes players on a fun adventure throughout a breathtaking world, showcasing some of the best graphics you'll find anywhere in VR. Beyond the epic vistas, the game's smaller details—like rich foliage, an array of climbing gadgets, and interactive props—make Call of the Mountain a very immersive game. It's a joy to see the sci-fi beasts of the Horizon world up close in VR, and their excellent animations and sound effects make them thoroughly believable. While combat could be a bit more fluid and climbing could have more interesting challenges, as a whole the game offers up a satisfying dose of VR native gameplay. Beyond the great environmental art, Call of the Mountain's characters are also impressively rendered, though unfortunately they're not involved or developed enough to make them memorable.","Technically impressive spin-off with stunning vistas, solid rock-climbing mechanics and entertaining fights using bow and arrow. It plays it a bit too safe and hardly showcases some of the capabilities specific to PlayStation VR2, but does make it easy getting to terms with VR for less experienced players.","Horizon Call of the Mountain is a brilliant way to kick off PSVR 2 and remains compelling until the very end. By leaning into the medium’s physicality, Firesprite and Guerrilla created a game that could only work in VR and simultaneously feels faithful to the Horizon franchise. I do wish Ryas was a more interesting character and while I wouldn’t call the gameplay revelatory, what’s here feels incredibly polished and looks absolutely stunning. This is an undoubtably an essential game for all PlayStation VR2 owners. [Essential]",,,,,,,,,,,,
nba-2k21,,,,,,,,,"The game looks miles better than its PS4 and Xbox One counterparts, but a fresh coat of paint and better animations can't fix the biggest issue NBA 2K21 and every other 2K game in the past 4 or 5 years have: Microtransactions.",,,,"NBA 2K21 nails the 3 when it comes to gameplay and performance, all but sending the PS4 version to the annals of history. However, game mode choices and lack of MyPlayer transfer keep the PS4 version relevant when it comes to time investment and previous playtime.

Crisper graphics do take away bits and pieces of the atmosphere built on foggy, dark and smudgy visuals, but also breathe in some new life. Almost as amazing as it was when it was originally released, this remastered release is a game you should undoubtedly get if you are into the genre.",,,"Despite a few ageing visuals and dodgy mechanics, Alan Wake is just as captivating and memorable as it was 11 years ago. With satisfying combat, a brilliantly-paced story, and fantastic setting, Remedy's horror-thriller is absolutely worth the punt if you're a fan of the studio's more recent output or just have a curious interest in horror.",,,,,,,,"Alan Wake Remastered is a much profound work that you may think. The change in engine and all the improvements, makes it a great return to Bright Falls.",,,"Alan Wake has aged well and still offers a compelling thriller story with some fun gameplay to keep you entertained for a dozen or fifteen hours. Whether you missed the game way back when it first came out, or just haven’t played it in a decade, it’s a worthy addition to any collection.",,,,,,An uneven action experience gets by on a huge amount of charm and a gorgeous visual treatment that more than holds its own ten years later.,,,,,,"After finding out how deep the dark water goes, Alan Wake left us with not a lake, but an ocean of questions.

Especially now, when the writer's journey through the night will seemingly continue at last.",,,,"If you’ve never played Alan Wake before and love spooky games with strong stories and plenty of action, consider this remaster a must-have. Thanks to its upgraded visuals, ardent Alan Wake fans are likely to want to pick it up, too, and they won’t be disappointed.

Story and atmosphere are kept unaltered for a good reason: they still are tremendously engaging.","As a big fan of the original, the announcement of Alan Wake Remastered was a pleasant surprise. And while I enjoyed my time with it, I can’t help but feel like this is merely a tiny taste of what’s to come. Veterans of the franchise won’t find any reason to go back, and if they do, they may even find that the memory of playing Alan Wake is better than the game itself. Newcomers will find a lot to love; however, granted, they can grind through its annoyances.","Alan Wake Remastered is a great game with capital letters and a perfect opportunity to enjoy it if it once escaped you. A horror adventure that moves the strings of psychological power like no one else, exploring the fears that we have in our heads.",,,,,,"Alan Wake is a gold standard when it comes to telling an incredible story, and nothing has changed with that in Alan Wake Remastered. The gameplay still feels pretty awesome, even if it sometimes shows its age, but nothing about that detracts from one of the best games of the last decade which feels at home, for the most part, in 2021. Visually, this game is taken to new heights, and even if it doesn’t look or play as good as Control, Alan Wake Remastered, like the Bioshock Collection before, will leave players remembering that wonderful day in May of 2010 when they dove into Cauldron Lake for the first time. Or is it an ocean?","Alan Wake Remastered is exactly what it says in the title, and that is a good thing. Alan Wake has received a thorough and clean remaster that doesn't compromise its original look and vision but enhances the gameplay by using all of the PS5's central features, including fast loading times and DualSense feedback. Its story and gameplay, while not perfect, still hold up well today. There is no story-driven game quite like Alan Wake, and being able to revisit this Xbox 360 classic on the PS5 is a dream come true — especially since this likely means that we will get that long-promised sequel.",,,"Alan Wake Remastered is a prime example of if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it. The story, and the way it’s told is truly timeless, and it's a game that everyone should experience.

With a fair price, this remaster is an absolute must for newcomers of the franchise.",,"For existing fans, this no-frills remaster is the best way to experience the 2010 game on modern consoles, but in 2021, much of the title simply doesn't hold up. Without the benefit of nostalgia, Alan Wake doesn't work as horror because it's not scary, as a thriller because long stretches of the game are fantastically boring, or as an action game because the combat is uninspired and repetitive. There's an interesting central mystery here, but like Alan Wake himself, you'll have to go through hell to find it.",,This is the best version of Alan Wake you can play - but it’s also pretty much identical with the original game and the gameplay definitely feels a bit dated.,,"The original was always highly simplistic and repetitive, and neither the passage of time or being in 4K can do anything to improve this disappointingly trivial actioner.","In short, a very pleasant return for those who had already finished the game at the time. A must for others.",,,"Up until that bizarre glitch, enjoying Alan Wake Remastered was like the best kind of deja vu. Muscle memory steered me toward the hidden caches, triggered reminders to backtrack just a little here and there or look around that corner for collectibles.

Those cold waters of Cauldron Lake sure are impossible to escape.","If it’s your first time visiting Bright Falls or you just want to take in the scenery again before the next chapter in Remedy’s overarching franchise rears its head, there’s no better way to experience Alan Wake’s original nightmare.",,,,,,"This PlayStation debut is a straightforward remaster of the original, faults and all.

Still, it is a very welcome release for PlayStation owners who missed it the first time. Apart from the faces, every aspect of the original has aged beautifully in the time since, and its twisty, American-literature-flavored plot still holds up as well. It would have been nice to see some of Control featured here, and the fact that American Nightmare has been left out is disappointing, but if you’ve never experienced this journey for yourself, it’s a perfect time to jump into the cold waters of Cauldron Lake.",,"A graphical facelift will be appreciated by fans, and make it easier for newcomers to experience a cult classic. However the game itself has not been improved and shows its age across its dull repetitive combat, stilted animations and decade old ideas.

While its story elements hold up well, much of the gameplay feels dated when compared to the games of today. This engaging narrative will only take it so far, as cumbersome controls and repetitive, paint-by-numbers gameplay mean at times, players may be left a little bit bored or frustrated.",,,,"Alan Wake Remastered is an example of what can be a good remaster of a videogame without an abusive price, it fixes some of the main issues that prevented a good game to make sense in today’s standards.

Finding myself completely captivated, Remedy left me wanting more, even after completing the DLC. It’s regrettable that Remastered’s cutscenes have problems and I hope they can be patched, but ultimately, it’s a fine job. If you’re a fan of mystery thrillers, I cannot recommend Alan Wake Remastered highly enough.",,,,,,,,"Alan Wake: Remastered, although a bit didactic in the narrative and frayed in the gameplay, is still an entertaining video game full of charm.",,"While not dazzling as a remaster, the core Alan Wake experience holds up well.",,,"Although some visual and design elements feel a bit dated, Alan Wake Remastered is the definitive version of an all-time classic horror game.","Alan Wake remastered is a good upgrade, both for old fans and new. The new textures and the modernized lighting system make the game a lot prettier to look at. A pity the cutscenes are 30 fps locked and their animations a bit sluggish, though.",,,,,,,,"A nice new coat of paint for Alan Wake, and the gameplay doesn't change a bit for better or worse. An unforgettable experience even now, but might be that your memories of the game itself are embellished and Alan Wake did age a bit.",,,,"Fans of Control or those simply curious about who ‘that Alan Wake guy’ is would do well to pick this remastered edition up. At a solid asking price, it’s a fantastic narrative experience that’s worth playing even with the janky older controls, while returning fans will get a kick out of reliving the experience on modern hardware.","Visual irritations aside, Alan Wake Remastered is really just a game I'm glad exists. This is the nicest-looking, best-realized version of Remedy's 2010 title, and it holds up today just as well as it did when it originally appeared on the Xbox 360. If you're sitting on a copy of Alan Wake on PC, this is an upgrade you can probably skip--though the enhanced visuals are nice, they likely don't represent a big-enough change to warrant snagging a whole second copy of the game.",,"But even if you miss all of that beautiful metatext, Alan Wake remains a tense thriller that will keep players on the edge of their seats and is a testament to how sometimes less can be more, even in relatively big-budget game designs. Alan Wake Remastered presents an opportunity for a new generation of players to experience a gem that never got its due, and they'd be foolish not to take advantage. Still, they may want to keep on the lights when they do.",,,,"Alan Wake Remastered is still a fantastically playable game a decade later. With updated visuals, all the DLC, and some small tweaks, it’s a chance for newcomers to find out what the fuss was all about, and for fans to conveniently play a classic through again armed with knowledge from the more recent games in the developer’s oeuvre.",,,,,,"Alan Wake has grown old with all the grace that a similar cult title deserves. It did not lose anything from its personal charm, and although the authors could go a step further in improving animations, it is a great game, which you can find at Sony console for the first time.",,"Alan Wake Remastered is the perfect way for PlayStation 5 users to experience the story of Alan Wake. However, players looking for a refreshing experience might find themselves with a bit too much of the same thing that's been seen in previous versions of the game.

The charming Aussie voice cast conveys a great sense of place, just as the design does a good job recreating that awkward waiting around in hospitals feeling. It's recommended by us, but it might not be your cup of tea either.",,,,,"Wayward Strand all in all is a unique enough game that showcases interesting game elements and story with interesting characters and different backgrounds of characters that think, talk, and feel all uniquely different. But with different narrative outcomes and endings it does not feel entirely rewarding to play the game more and more to get those unique differences or moments.",,,,,,,,,,,"Wayward Strand is a delightfully grounded game, despite its foreign setting. In this small, cozy space there is genuine hope, sadness, anger, and love. These are real people and Casey is a young girl learning how to grasp the world in new ways. Players have the ability to be an active part of this experience and let the world envelop them, or buck responsibility for personal gain. Like Casey, like Tomi, or Mr. Avery, or Dr. Shen, or Esther, or like Joe, I wish I had more time to see and do everything all at once. Alas, in life you do not get a repeat performance. At least here there are bountiful opportunities to make friends, to be compassionate, to listen, to sit, to breathe, and to exist. Each day and each run a chance to do something more valuable than the last.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wayward Stand tells an intimate story that you discover at your own pace. The non-linear design gives you the freedom to personalize your journey through a long weekend at work with your mother.

While the conclusion is a little lacklustre and there is an absence of gameplay, this is a wonderful passage through a moment in time.",,,"Wayward Strand is one of the most sophisticated narrative-focused games of recent times and, in its simplicity, manages to be captivating and sensitive without appealing to any cheap sentimentality. It should not appeal to every type of player, but fans of the genre will find here an authentic experience, striking characters, and really meaningful choices.",,,,,,,,"Wayward Strand offers up a uniquely Australian take on the narrative adventure game with a gorgeous art direction and moving portrayal of hard-working people in a harsh system.

[Issue#360, p.114]","Despite my problems with the above-water sequences, I still found Subnautica: Below Zero to be a delight. It expands on the first game’s worldbuilding, offers surprises and thrills in equal measure, and most importantly, it takes a huge amount of frustration (if not all of it) out of survival. The end of the story promises a third chapter which could open up the world in even more intriguing ways, and if the developers can keep improving their formula, I’m very excited to see what’s next.",,,,,,,,"Subnautica: Below Zero is a sublimely addictive timesink and an exemplary survival adventure game that transcends the genre. The improvements to the formula of the original game are minimal but impactful. Fans of the franchise will certainly have plenty to get into, and the appeal is broad enough to welcome many more newcomers to the experience. Whilst there is little ground broken in terms of visuals, Subnautica Below Zero more than compensates with an all-round stellar experience that rivals that of bigger budget productions.",,,,,,,,"Subnautica: Below Zero is easily one of the best survival/exploration games of this year, and you should definitely check it out even if you weren't a fan of the first game.",,,"Subnautica: Below Zero is not as large as 2014’s Subnautica but it is as deep. Between its fantastically mysterious story to its compelling biome, Below Zero builds upon what made the first game strong while being unique all on its own.

You stumble across the plot every couple of hours, but much of your playtime is spent staying alive. The various gameplay loops have been tweaked, modified, and expanded from the original, but fans of the first game will find a lot of this very familiar. On the other hand, if you’ve been starving for more Subnautica, Below Zero is an absolute feast. You’re constantly scanning, salvaging, crafting, cooking, and expanding your little empire. Depending on your tolerance for stress, this can either be a serene little salt-crusted sandbox, or a nail-biting marathon. Either way, Subnautica: Below Zero is one ocean expedition you won’t want to miss.","Conceived as an expansion of the original Subnautica comes its new installment in which to explore an icy location, plagued with new dangers, aquatic environments and for the first time on foot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Curiously, the way Below Zero oscillates from long restive stretches between points of interest to short bursts of perilous activity absorbed my attention in ways many more-frenzied popular horror games don’t.","Not everyone will warm up to Subnautica: Below Zero, but it’s an unquestionably rewarding release once you begin to get a foothold into the frigid foray. The game’s constantly tantalising you with new, exciting equipment, and its otherworldly ocean is an immersive environment in which to spend your time. A lack of landmarks mean that it can be a little too easy to get lost, and the story is light and largely uninteresting – but if the act of building an underwater base appeals to you, then this PS5 sequel unquestionably has strong foundations.",,,,"A mellow paced and captivating game of underwater exploration, crafting, and discovery, that feels more like a Subnautica expansion than a discrete sequel.","Subnautica Below Zero does not seem to want to walk in other steps than that of its big brother. By reducing the map or vehicles, Below Zero is more to be seen as a very good expansion of the original game, more scripted version and a little more hostile than the first episode. If Below Zero undoubtedly does better than the competition when it comes to making a scripted survival game, with a universe as enchanting as it is frightening hand-crafted, it would undoubtedly have gained more from the experience of 'origin to fully conquer the veterans of the franchise, who, despite everything, will take undeniable pleasure to go diving again, just like the newcomers, who will have the chance to discover for the first time this atypical and oh so immersive way of approaching the game of survival.",,,"Subnautica: Below Zero will grow on you, if you give it time. While the beginning hours aren’t nearly as rough as the last time around, a dedicated session or two of several hours is essentially mandatory before the adventure really starts to open up. After that, though, the sense of exploration is fantastic, the story is engaging, and the views can be spectacular. Fans of Subnautica should pick this up as soon as they can, and anyone else interested in exploration-style games should also give it a shot. Subnautica: Below Zero continues in its predecessor’s footsteps in all the right ways, with some additions that help make the adventure more accessible. You’ll be glad you took the plunge.",,,,,,,"Though it’s obvious this wasn’t intended to be a true sequel, Below Zero’s frozen trimmings still make it a worthwhile expedition.

blacktail,,,,,,,,,,"Blacktail is a true hidden gem that is just a perfect window into an Alice in Wonderland-like world full of Slavic myths and masterfully written characters with a lot of lore and care written into them. The combat doesn’t revolutionize the genre, but it poses a beautiful atmospheric experience that many people will enjoy.",,,"With its bewitching fairy-tale presentation, satisfying combat, enticing exploration of a beautiful world and a narrative that is lovingly inspired by dark Slavic fables, I really enjoyed my time with Blacktail. Though the various gameplay systems are very much inspired from what we've seen in similar games already and the platforming side of things isn't quite as polished as I might like, Blacktail nonetheless is a thoroughly enjoyable action RPG that serves as a stellar debut effort for Polish developer The Parasight. I can't wait to see what they come up with next.",,,,,,,,,,,,"My time with Blacktail was frustrating. Not because it was a pain to play or that the writing was awful, but because there’s a strong game buried underneath some strange design decisions and disappointing performance issues.

Combining the strategy of breaking the ship with the skill of positioning yourself in place to do so, Shipbreaker wraps it up well with a clever main story to maximize - well, reduction of debt. But most of all, it's calming and fun, set in a world that feels similar to the many wonderful other sci-fi stories that have captured us over the years.

It's eerily beautiful, well made and fans of board games will fall in love with it. The combat system is rewarding and has just enough nuance to keep it interesting until the end. So roll your dice and take a chance on Lost in Random. It is a unique game amongst its current peers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lost in Random offers a vivid world and unique bunch of characters, but some of the cities sadly feels pretty samey with not enough personality and variety.",,,,"Thanks to its absolutely sublime art style, excellent voice acting and its dark, fairytale-like narrative, Lost in Random is a wonderful adventure that will have you gripped. It’s a shame there’s no lip syncing to really finish off the visuals, and combat can be a little frustrating at times, but in the grand scheme of things these are miniscule issues. There’s so much originality and charm here that it’s hard not to fall in love with the world of Random.",,,"Despite some clunky movement, Lost in Random features smart combat and a world filled with wonder, mystery, and excitement.",,"Lost in Random is clearly a Zoink! game, though you can't compare it to other games from the studio. The game has its own style and gameplay and both of them are truly wonderful. If you like card games, dice games, or are simply addicted to adventuring this is the game for you. The game feels like a Tim Burton movie. Funny, but creepy and stylish at the same time. Lost in Random is truly compelling with an original story and once you start, you can't stop playing.",,"I think that if you translated Lost in Random's dark narrative and engagingly strange visual style into a stop-motion animated style film, it would be a powerful exploration of a harrowing and at times poignant journey through an upside down world ruled by disorder. There's a lot of that in the game, too, but it's made less effective by tepid mechanics and tedious, unrewarding combat. The story and setting are absolutely worth experiencing, but there's probably a chance you'll be as disappointed by the gameplay as you are enchanted by the tale.","Lost in Random has very good ideas and a development that combines its gothic atmosphere with a combat system inspired by the best role-playing games. But, when you repeat the same process continuously, the sensations are more bitter.","The story grabs you immediately and maintains a steady drip-feeding of excitement throughout its playtime and the game is just overall a refined, lovingly crafted adventure that will appeal to even those who are generally turned off by “card battle” games, as the content and gameplay here goes much deeper than that.",,,,,,"Lost in Random is a magical experience in several areas. The story, presentation, and world are a joy to experience from start to finish, with a few minor exceptions. On the other hand, the combat is initially refreshing but is hindered by the length of encounters and a lack of depth in its mechanics, so later encounters feel like a frustrating chore. It's a fun action-adventure in short bursts, and Lost in Random deserves much more attention than it has received.",,,,,"The moody Tim Burton look, the innovative combat system and the exceptional characters can't fully compensate for the lack of variety.","Even with its faults, there's simply no denying just how special of a game Lost in Random is. From its awe-inspiring world to its ingenious gameplay, there's a lot to love in this incredible and memorable albeit often-frustrating adventure.",,,,,,"Interesting and atmospheric, that’s Lost in Random in a nutshell. The unique combat system is also very much worth mentioning.

Add to that combat mechanics cleverly built and well executed despite some redundancies and some under-exploited ideas. But in the end, Zoink offers us a fascinating macabre tale that never runs out of steam over time and is worth browsing.",,"If you’re willing to overlook the bloated combat, you’ll find a lot to love in this macabre adventure about the bond between sisters.","Lost in Random is a magical adventure, and though its dice and card-based combat system never achieves a significant depth at which it could, its still a worthwhile journey.

Trust us, roll the dice on a purchase, and you will not be disappointed. [Issue#7, p.84]",,,,,"When I finished Lost in Random, I wanted to talk about it. I wanted to not just praise it, but really dig into the world and its combat system. It’s that kind of game that makes you wish you had a few people around you who also played it and who want to spend a few hours just going on and on about it. Sure, I wish there were bigger decks in the game, but that’s less a complaint and more an admittance that I just wanted more of Lost in Random.",,,,,,,"Lost in Random is a beautiful Burton-esque fantasy that comes close to evoking the same levels of craft and character as its obvious inspirations. It doesn’t quite sustain the wonder from start to finish, but it remains an easy recommendation.",It doesn’t seem random that Lost in Random is a great game. The developers put a lot of thought into crafting a fantastic gaming experience alongside a grim storybook adventure. It all works incredibly well with only a few dips of quality that will surely be fixed over time. I enjoyed this experience thoroughly as it delivers on its action-adventure and haphazard gameplay systems.,,,,,,"From the artistic direction to the narration, passing through the combat system, Lost in Random stages a suggestive contrast between order and chaos. A modern dark fairy tale that owes much of its aesthetic to the imagery of Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline, Lost in Random will undoubtedly conquer lovers of Tim Burton's works. Capable of entertaining, amusing, but also disturbing, the Indie by Zoink Games is absolutely recommended to all players looking for a good Action Adventure full of ideas and original solutions.",,,,,,"Lost in Random mostly benefits from its ""Tim Burtonesque"" visuals and quirky design, but unfortunately the whole experience is dragged down by a tiring card-based battle system, with cards that are bland.",,,,,"Lost In Random is a delightful, sprawling action adventure set in a dark but fun Tim Burton-esque universe. Its combat doesn't always hold up but exploring its worlds absolutely does.",,,,,,,"Lost in Random is easily one of the more unique games I’ve played recently. Offering an entertaining fusion of deck-builders and real-time combat, Zoink’s done well in realising their vision. Thanks to chance-based combat, lack of enemy variety and some long-winded dialogue with NPCs, it's not perfect, but ultimately, the positives outweigh these points. With some strong combat customisation, a captivating story and excellent art style, Lost in Random comes highly recommended.",,,,,,,,,,"This shadowy adventure will get you in the mood for Halloween all year around with its atmospheric design, creative combat system, and well-crafted story.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"As our minds turn toward more haunted holidays, it’s a good time to get lost in Random. Even’s commitment to her quest is enough to carry you through an awkwardly told story, and despite some parts of combat that feel too dependent on luck, the card-dice fights are truly unique. The pace of the journey, from drawn-out conversations to endings that cut you off from the best parts, befoul what is otherwise a fun world to explore.",,,Gothic fairytale stylings and unique mish-mash of systems come together into yet another great example of Zoink's boundless creativity and game design chops. Fans of Burton-esque worlds and tabletop tropes would do well to get Lost in Random.,,,"Even with that gripe, Lost in Random just does so much right that it doesn't even really matter. I wouldn't trade my experience in the game for anything, and I'd be willing to get lost in the world of Random all-over gain.

nba-2k23,,"The NBA 2K franchise is back and moving in the right direction. After years of stagnant gameplay mechanics and subtle improvements to its franchise mode, this year’s game has taken huge, direction-defining steps. NBA 2K23 offers an amazingly customizable experience. With the exception of a few perhaps philosophical issues and some lingering old assets still in use, this year’s version registers as an All-NBA first team selection within the series’ storied history.","NBA 2K23 is still the best possible product for basketball fans and the best thing you can ask for in a sports simulation game. The additions of historical content are jaw-dropping and have clearly received plenty of love. However, the online experience that makes the game so long lasting is highly compromised by the absurd need to spend even more to stay in the competition.",,,,"Developing a new title in the sports genre every year and improving at the same time is a real challenge for any company, but Visual Concepts managed to create a true 9th generation experience with NBA 2K23, offering solid visuals, stunning animations and tons of content while staying loyal to simulation gameplay. It is safe to say that the king is back.","As a package, NBA 2K23 is a phenomenal celebration of basketball. The return of the Jordan Challenge retells a stellar career and features exemplary presentation. NBA Eras takes you through an abundance of classic content and the on-court action feels tight and polished. MyCareer is substantial but still can't shake the intrusiveness of microtransactions. It delivers a decent story but can feel like a grind. Even with these problems, the sheer wealth of modes makes NBA 2K23 worthwhile.","It's the best this series has been in a long while, and it does so by catering not to 2K fans, but basketball fans in general. The Jordan Challenges, MyNBA Era and MyPlayer modes all give a sense of wonder and fun the series lacked in the last three games. And in the next game (That needs to feature Kobe Bryant on the cover), this is the line they need to drive to.",,,,"NBA 2K23 makes some worthy adjustments to gameplay, making this more entertaining without losing the game's fundamental presentation and feel. At the same time, even the map shrink in The City isn't enough of an addition to make 2K23 worth a must-buy status. Not enough of the game changes to merit a purchase this year, unless you maxed out everything in last year's release and want a fresh start. NBA 2K23 is more for die-hard fans than every before.",,NBA 2K23 takes you back in time to relive legendary moments in Basketball history and it also packs a fun career mode aside from its A.I issues and unbalanced multiplayer gameplay.,,,"Once again, Visual Concepts shows that they deserve all the credit, with solid gameplay and an absolutely huge amount of content. Special mention to Eras, a new addition that sets an inflection point in sports videogames.",,,,,,,,,,,"When we throw all the listed elements into a pot and mix them, we get an excellent playable basketball, which is great to watch and you will enjoy every single virtual game. But we already feel the stagnation in the series and the technical shortcomings do not help either.","This game should go down as one of the best sports games ever, instead it's a chilling reminder of the chokehold microtransactions have over the genre.","Visual Concepts once again gives us the definitive basketball experience in the world of videogames. Coinciding with the twenty-third anniversary of the numbering of their games, they could only point to excellence. The gameplay looks sharper and more precise than ever, the vintage game modes take us back to incredible times and MyTEAM and MyCareer remain a safe bet. Without a doubt, essential for lovers of sports games.",,,,,,,,,"VC issues aside, which aren’t anything new, NBA 2K23 is undoubtedly the best entry in the series for some years. Jordan Challenge is a great addition that can eat up many hours of your time, while MyCareer is more engrossing than ever thanks to its entertaining story. But ultimately, it’s the gameplay changes that make NBA 2K23 worth picking up. Playing basketball from the comfort of your couch has never looked or felt so good.",,NBA 2K23 is a solid basketball game that drops the ball with too much emphasis on microtransactions and poorly-thought out design in its main mode.,"NBA 2K23 is both fantastic and frustrating, where VC is a huge problem, but new modes like The Jordan Challenge is thoroughly enjoyable.",,"This year's NBA 2K game is one of the best in recent years. The MyCareer mode has an actual interesting story with a great cast of characters. The Jordan challenge is an incredible addition to the game and is really fun to play through. MyTeam is basically the same as last year but added Triple threat co-op, which is cool. The game does have some framerate issues and camera bugs which could be annoying but every good aspect of the game makes up for it.","NBA 2K23 is one of the best games that has ever stepped onto a sports court. Its gameplay and technical fundamentals are without doubt, but the addition of historic modes to its roster is a better move than the one the Chicago Bulls made when they selected Michael Jordan with the third pick in the 1984 Draft.","Overall, NBA 2K23 has some of the best gameplay in an NBA 2K game. While the MyPlayer mode is a bit of a shadow of its former self, the various additions and changes to MyTeam and MyNBA make up for it overall. Despite being on point in most areas, the Virtual Currency situation will definitely affect players’ enjoyment of the game. While the term “pay to win” does come to mind, NBA2K23’s gameplay and various modes are still very well done.","Although it has room for improvement, the truth is that it is a pleasant surprise after last year's title. 2K pays tribute to the NBA and recovers the value of the great moments that defined its rise to the Olympus of video games.","NBA 2K23 is a massive step forward for the series in nearly every fashion. Gameplay, presentation and experience upgrades make this the best 2K in years.","While the action on the court is still fantastic and the new game modes are very entertaining and play with basketball fans' nostalgia, NBA 2K23 is brought down by its excessive microtransactions, which are the very definition of ""pay-to-win"".","NBA 2K23 has it all. Its nostalgic ways massage the affection that more traditional NBA fans have for games and teams of the past, while also bringing a little bit of the history that turned the NBA into the emotional machine it is today. All of this combined with gameplay changes like improved spacing and better AI make this an ideal game for sports game fans. NBA 2K23 is indeed one of the best experiences for basketball fans in games, but please, stay away of its microtransactions. Particularly, we focus on the parts without it and that's the path for some real fun.","NBA 2k23 is more of the same thing, but refines the formula for fans of more realistic sports gaming. While its microtransactions are obstructive as ever, Jordan’s Challenge is a labor of love for basketball fans. You’ll get to play moments of history with an authentic flair to it thanks to some beautiful old-school filters. And while the graphics are slightly inferior and it lacks The City, last-gen is still a viable option to experience this brushed-up basketball simulation.","I can safely recommend NBA 2K23 to every sports games fan, even though the microtransactions are extremely aggressive. The gameplay is too good, and I hope future updates won’t break it.",,"I would recommend NBA 2K23 for its sheer breadth of material and the fact that it really tries to be a basketball universe unto itself (hence the massive file size). It's certainly not perfect, as I still keep running into odd glitches now and then, and even some strange things that carry over from the last game (Do I really have to keep walking through the Dallas Mavericks shootaround to get to my guys? Why is that still a thing?), but it is and shall likely always be the sports game I play almost every day, no matter what time of year it actually is — even when the fans tell me I stink.",,,,,,,"NBA 2K23 is the Michael Jordan of the basketball games. Stunning visuals, improved gameplay and the additions of Eras to the MyNBA mode and the Jordan Challenges make it a must-have for basketball fans. The only issue with NBA 2K23 is an old one: microtransactions. But, if you're a 2K fan, you already know that.",,"Those who’ve been playing the recent releases will find NBA 2K23 more of an update to the previous version rather than a completely new iteration of a popular franchise. And they wouldn’t be wrong. 2K has tried to polish the best parts of the game, while also reducing the focus on the ones that don’t seem to be praised as much as others. Eventually, NBA 2K23 is a game that will still keep you entertained for some time, though the lack of a more massive overhaul will probably upset way too many fans of the franchise.",,,"2K is back again with an annual installment in the NBA franchise and it dishes out more of the same, supplemented with new elements and improvements. The latter makes for even better gameplay and the new features, such as the Jordan Challenge, are great fun. Graphically, too, it is again impressive, were it not for the fact that some frame drops can occur. Also, the game can crash, which is annoying. Even more annoying are the many microtransactions, which remains a problem in this series. Other than that an excellent basketball game.",,"It may be easy to accuse sports games of offering the same experience year in and year out, but you simply can’t say that about NBA 2K23. The game still has issues with its overemphasis on microtransactions in MyCareer and to a lesser extent MyTeam, but the new MyNBA Eras mode is a revelation – and the Jordan Challenge campaign is damn fun, too. On the court, 2K Sports has made some nice balancing tweaks and also improved the overall AI to make matches more dynamic and competitive, and when you pair all of that with all the new animations, you end up with a basketball sim that’s the very definition of a slam dunk.",,,,,"Undoubtedly the best opus of the license released to date. In addition to the already gargantuan lifespan, further improved in solo and multiplayer thanks to a My NBA mode boosted by the choice of 4 eras, the return of the Jordan Challenge, the co-op mode in My Team and the Career Theater, the gameplay in will delight some. The former crazy dribblers are now limited online and must think collectively, the shooting timing is more demanding, but much fairer and a lot of new animations come to shake up the regulars. Graphically impeccable, taking in immersion with old-school skins for period matches, the title enters the Hall of Fame. Only gray areas, the usual desire (or even need) to take out the credit card to get more VC and advance your player, a matchmaking that is still quite unbalanced and some crashes on certain career quests. Even MJ can have flaws.",,,,"NBA 2K23 is worth the price of admission almost entirely because of how good the new MyNBA Eras mode is. What makes NBA 2K23 the best installment in years is the well-needed gameplay changes, as well as the return of the enthralling Jordan Challenge mode. Sadly, 2K keeps much of the fun locked behind an expensive paywall that simply cannot be justified.",,"NBA 2K23 leaves us torn: On the one hand, it’s an almost perfect simulation of the sport delivering a high amount of detail and gameplay-value. On the other hand, the experience is heavily harmed by microtransactions and in-game advertisments.",,,,"The same great core experience and slick presentation we’re used to, with a number of welcome changes.

It’s the little things that help to make NBA 2K23 the best sports representation to date, and the legacy content now puts the series far ahead of any other sports series out there. It’s not without its fault, beginning with the difficulty and learning curve of the game. Every bit of content in this year’s game is fresh and useful and you’ll find yourself playing every mode. If you purchased the version that offers 100K virtual currency, you have to choose if that’s going to MyPLAYER or to MyTEAM. The modes remain a grind to keep the player on the game, but the Jordan Challenge is worth the price of admission to begin with. This is better than the 2K Showcases in the WWE series due to the presentation aspect. It’ll be difficult for 2K to one-up NBA 2K23, one of the best video game sports adaptions of all time.",,"NBA 2K23 is a solid step forward pretty much in every aspect, apart from the visuals and MyCareer, that are not as surprising or attractive as they were before.","NBA 2K23 does a killer job of opening the floor to those that are new to the franchise, or those returning for their umpteenth time. With gorgeous visuals that help solidify this as one of the best-looking games of the generation so far, to controls that let you feel like a pro, there's very little to complain about here.",,,"NBA2K23 came with some interesting changes by bring back old memories. Jordan's legendary career and the year-based dynasty mode are both very attractive new features. NBA 2K23 is still the best basketball game in the world, even though it's still similar to NBA2K22. I'm glad to see that the NBA 2K series have made some innovations and changes, but there is still a lot of room for further improvements.","NBA 2K23 has something for everyone to get stuck into – whether you want to get engrossed in the Jordan era or have your own come up in MyCareer, all provide a lot to work with.

It lacks depth in some game modes and others can be repetitive but its gameplay is worthy of 2K games.,,,"NBA 2K23 is one of the best entry in the series so far, thanks to its devout tribute to the story of the sport and a few gameplay innovations. ERA MyNBA e the Jordan Challanges represent the best example of sport digital storyitelling in the world of videogames, while MyTeam and MyCareer suffer from the usual monetization policy, even if The City is far more engaging than the last year. On the court NBA 2K23 is a solid basketball experience, with a new shooting system that feels simple and consistent.","NBA 2K23 shines this year on next-gen and positions itself as one of the best episodes of the license released so far. A gargantuan content, a neat technique, a gameplay much more faithful to the real thing, winks every 5 minutes for NBA fans, a less fraudulent My Team mode and a very positive NBA League Pass offer for the players. However, we can't ignore the differences between the current-gen and next-gen versions given the prices displayed... It is urgent that 2K wakes up and stops this unequal practice towards the players by proposing similar versions or at adequate prices according to what is offered to the players. This 2023 vintage is back on the throne of sports simulations by advocating excellence in the image of an ever more legendary Michael Jordan.","Overall, NBA 2K23 is a fitting tribute to the historical legends and iconic moments that made this sport what it is today. Though the game has its fair share of issues with its poor narrative choices and omnipresent microtransactions, it’s still a solid improvement over the previous game. This year’s release isn’t quite the flashy free-throw line dunk that lands a perfect score, but it is a worthy, all-around effort that would earn M.J.’s shrug of approval.","If you like the NBA, if you are fond of basketball games, there are no alternatives, you will definitely play this game.

The end result is the sort of gloriously freewheeling, acrobatic first-person shooting extravaganza which aims to demonstrate that innovation in the genre doesn't have to just begin and end at the the gun clasped tightly in your hands.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Severed Steel‘s campaign may be short, but it’s very sweet. And the high-octane nature of its action is intoxicating, meaning you’re likely to engage with firefight mode and perhaps even play through the campaign again with Mutators active. A single-player only experience, those who like waging war while feeling like a badass will be in their element here. It’s an absolute blast from beginning to end.",,,,,,,,,,"Severed Steel was a pleasant surprise because of its gameplay which, in addition to being extremely fun, is also very well made. The campaign and and the challenges complete this package with a considerable amount of content. If you are a fast-paced FPS fan, Severed Steel is a title that needs your attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,An entertaining and lightning fast (but really short) experience that mixes FPS and Mirror's Edgesque parkour in a simil-VR voxel context.

Undoubtedly stands out from the others, unfortunately it is very short.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite a disappointingly short length and lack of story, Severed Steel excels in how it actually feels to play. When it clicks, it becomes a zen-like dance, a series of playgrounds full of deeply rewarding kills and Matrix-inspired acrobatics. The levels themselves are varied enough to keep things interesting, and the game moves at an impressively fast pace. The lack of bosses could be seen as a missed opportunity, but the game still has much to offer. Severed Steel is a cathartic experience that thoroughly delivers in what it sets out to accomplish – making you feel badass.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jurassic-world-evolution-2,,,,,,,,,,"Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a solid sequel to the already decent predecessor. It presents the player with a larger selection of dinosaurs, a welcome addition of visitor management and some various tweaks and additions that overall make the game experience much more realistic and enjoyable. It falls a bit with its too “micromanage-y” systems at some points and lacklustre campaign, but it is a sure sight of joy for any fans of tycoon games and Jurassic series alike.",,,,,,,,,,,"Although it does not end up being as robust an experience as other games of the genre (Planet Coaster, Surviving Mars), Jurassic World Evolution 2 still is a complete game, which solved the weaknesses of its predecessor and wanted to respond to users that are not-so-enthusiastic about the Tycoon resulting in a title that is not complex and quite friendly for the players.",,"Overall, Jurassic World Evolution 2 delivers on its promise of surpassing its predecessor thanks to improved dinosaurs, deeper management simulation mechanics, and game modes catering to different players. While Chaos Theory lets players visit and rewrite iconic moments in the film franchise, Sandbox Mode is undoubtedly the heart and soul of Jurassic World Evolution 2 for the way it highlights all of the new features and improvements.",,,,"This then is the challenge with Jurassic World Evolution 2. If you're a Jurassic Film fan who also likes micromanagement, there's certainly enough meat on its dinosaur bones to keep you happy for a good long while. However, if you're more just a management sim fan, you'll probably find its quirky management style – sometimes hands-on, sometimes hands-off – a tad irritating, as well as the limitations of its console controls.",,,,,,,"Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a much better game than its predecessor was at launch. That said, I can’t shake the feeling that much like the original, it’s only going to get better and more content-rich in the next coming year or so. It’s a beautiful trend from Frontier Developments that I think will make an already great game all the more excellent.",,,,,,,,,"Jurassic World Evolution 2 features a deeper process of building and managing your park, despite constant threats that stop it from thriving.",,,,"Despite being frustrated by the initial limitations of the Sandbox Mode and the lackluster campaign, I found a lot to enjoy and appreciate about Jurassic World Evolution 2. Chaos Theory is an engaging and creative way of blending the iconic films into the game, and the new aquatic and flying dinosaurs are among the best of many new animals. Building and managing a theme park full of impossibly ancient animals is challenging and rewarding, and despite some annoyances, the game also manages to retain many grin-worthy moments of wonder at the improbable. People and dinosaurs just aren’t meant to be in the same place at the same time.",,"There's still some way to go to make the JWE franchise a viable management sim, but this sequel goes a long way to right a lot of its predecessor's wrongs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jurassic World Evolution 2 is an absolute treat for Jurassic Park fans. It nails the atmosphere of the franchise and offers a lot of options to customize your park. However, if you're not a diehard Jurassic Park fan, you might find the management aspect a bit too limited, the visuals a bit too underwhelming and the amount of actual innovation rather disappointing.",,"If we had to make a list of things that are totally radical then dinosaurs chasing and eating annoying fannypack-wearing tourists while we triumphantly hum the Jurassic Park theme tune would be top ten. Maybe even top five. We're here for that.

However, designing and building your own Jurassic Park is a magical experience that everyone with a love for dinosaurs should experience.",A bigger and better sequel which works as both a compelling management sim and a celebration of the Jurassic Park franchise.,"If a few additions strengthen the depth of the game a little, such as scientists or territory management, others are a little more cumbersome without being unduly disturbing. If we would have liked more clear-cut news, we once again had a great time on Jurassic World Evolution 2, for a good twenty hours.",,,,"With a huge amount of content to discover, lovingly-crafted dinosaurs that feel truly alive, and the thrill of revisiting iconic moments from the franchise in Chaos Theory mode, this is the closest you’re going to get to running your own Jurassic Park in real life.","Jurassic Park Evolution 2 is a bigger, better and more balanced management simulation, that runs through the entire cinematic franchise. If you enjoyed the first game, you will definitely enjoy this one.",,,,,"A park management game that makes keeping all the plates spinning on a controller feel natural. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs too often feel sidelined. [Issue#9, p.88]",,,,,,,,"The fact that Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a worthwhile game isn’t surprising. Frontier Developments has a fantastic track record with this kind of game, as proven in Planet Zoo or the first edition of this title. What works in this game’s favor is the expanded roster of dinosaurs, the new challenges and the fantastic animations and behaviors of the exhibits. Being a licensed game, the temptation towards being simple had to have been strong. Some would argue the first game swung to hard in the accessible direction. With this newest iteration, the game walks the line of easy to understand but deep enough to remain engaging. Despite frustrations, Frontier Developments, much like life, found a way.","Jurassic World Evolution 2 changes the game in more ways than one, letting players spend less time creating parks and attractions and more time reacting to a world where dinosaurs already exist.","This is a solid evolution –no pun intended– of the series, where everything is better and clearer. making it a more enjoyable experience for both fans and newcomers.",,"Jurassic World Evolution 2 is bigger, better, and bolder, and smooths off some of the original’s rough edges. Frontier has tinkered with the management sim aspects, and brought in a canonical campaign into the mix that follows directly on from the events in Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom, but the dinosaurs remain the star of the show. If you’re a fan of the franchise – and really, who doesn’t love uncontrollable carnivores? – then Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a perfect sequel.",,,"Building on the immense foundations of the original, Jurassic World Evolution 2 provides more of the same addictive management gameplay with the thrill of seeing the prehistoric reptiles in all their glory. The new additions are light and there’s still some minor issues, but it’s all forgotten as you behold a T-Rex emerging from the shadows for the first time.","Jurassic World Evolution 2 is the perfect sequel- it's bigger, better, and toothier than its predecessor in almost every way that matters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jurassic World Evolution 2 brings many good novelties to the tried and tested formula of the original, but still represents a title only for the most patient fans of dinosaurs and managerial simulations.

Those looking for a more substantial sequel may want to spare the expense this time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you enjoyed the original game, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is sure to bring you hours of entertainment (not including the “campaign”).

klonoa-phantasy-reverie-series,,,,,"Having not played wither Klonoa before this review, I was expecting a bubbly platformer that was a product of its time, but instead, I was floored by how beautiful Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series was, and by how strongly it connected with me on an emotional level. I hope see more of this in the genre.",,,,,,,,"Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is a faithful and entertaining remaster of two classic PlayStation platformers. Bandai Namco did an excellent job keeping the franchise's identity alive and preserving the faithful combat and platforming. Though it may feel dated by today's standards, those who remember the Klonoa series will love these remasters, and those jumping in for the first time will experience simple platformers from a simpler time in game design.",,,,,,,,,,,I’m so glad that Namco Bandai re-released these games during Klonoa’s twenty-fifth anniversary year. They hold up remarkable well over time and have aged beautifully. I sure hope we see more of Klonoa going forward.,"If you’re expecting completely remade games, this isn’t the remaster collection for you. But if you want to relive your childhood memories and frustrations with Klonoa, the Phantasy Reverie Series is the way to do it. Getting two cult-classics in one is a fantastic deal, and if you can look past the quirks and situate yourself firmly in 2001, you’ll find these games just as perfect as you remember them. And if you missed out on the Klonoa hype as a kid but enjoy early 2000s platformers and want to see what all the fuss is about, there’s no better time to dive into the dream than now.",,"The passage of time can sometimes be kind to classic games. Where Klonoa was once compared unfavourably to the far more “innovative” platformers that were doing the rounds, perhaps now it can be judged on its own merits instead, and while neither of the two Klonoa games are especially flashy or spectacular, the subtle and nuanced whimsy that sits at their core offers a particularly potent foil to the self-seriousness that far too many modern games – even platformers – express. Whether you’re replaying these for nostalgia or discovering them for the first time, Klonoa’s going to win you over with this collection.","It might be easy to say that Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is simply a pair of remastered games that can't compare to more modern platformers, but that's only half-true. Although their relatively low sales and cult status meant that the formula wasn't really given the chance to evolve, almost anyone can still jump into these games and have a good time. The lack of meaningful new content on par with Klonoa's Wii remake from 2008 is disappointing, but the content that is here is still worthwhile. Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is a nice offering to underserviced fans, and can also be a good package for newcomers - or even people who are picking up a platformer for the first time.","25th anniversary of Klonoa brings the long-lost series back to our cozy game libraries and gives us chance to defeat nightmares of Phantomile and Lunatea once more. Klonoa and his friends look in 4K and 60FPS more beautiful than ever and the remastered textures, sounds and this 2,5D experience will bring nostalgic tears to your eyes. However, 25 years of technological advance has shown its toll on the game and sometimes you will have to push through some not very pleasant moments.",,,,,"Nothing needs to be reassessed because nothing has been significantly changed. These are still two charming, well-polished platformers. There’s nothing mind-blowing about them, but I enjoy them for what they are and think more people should experience them. More effort could have been made in this collection, but the graphical clean-up is appreciated. I’m shrugging. You can’t see it, since this is a text review, but my shoulders are up.",,,,,"Between wonder-filled stages and mini segments of mine cart riding and flying, there’s plenty in Klonoa Phantasy Reverie that feels familiar, but fresh. The collection naturally evokes a purer time in gaming where simplicity was key, and loveable mascots were trendy. While Klonoa was never the mainstream success it aimed to be, this remaster is the perfect opportunity for the franchise to dazzle a whole new audience.","Had the additional DLC package been included with the game as standard, we’d probably suggest Klonoa Phantasy Reveries Series as a must-have for fans hungry to spend time with its cool cat protagonist again. It would be easier to recommend to newcomers, too. But as it is, while some will get plenty of enjoyment out of it at full price, most might want to wait until it goes on sale. Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is an enjoyable blast from the past, but it’s by no means essential playing.",,,"The Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is a love letter to fans of the series, but by modern standards the games fall a little short.",,"Klonoa sees the revival of two beloved, but underappreciated platformer games from the early PlayStation years. While the graphics have been souped up, the gameplay is near identical including its unique use of catching and using enemies. Some quality-of-life changes have been made to make the games more accessible to both old and new players, most notably a more modern use of checkpointing.","Phantasy Reverie Series is a great opportunity to play again (or discover for the first time) two cult platform games. Some elements feel outdated, even with the graphic improvements, but they are still fun to play.",,,,"Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series brings together the two main games of the franchise, updating aesthetic elements and adapting details to the present time without mischaracterizing what made the series stand out in the not-so-distant past. Even with some occasional dated details, the collection is great for introducing the brand to a new generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Phantasy Reverie Series is a relatively no-frills remaster collection. There's a couple of quality of life improvements and the games have a fresh lick of high definition paint, but if you didn't like Klonoa back in the day then you're not going to like it now. If you didn't play Klonoa at the time then you won't have the prerequisite nostalgia goggles necessary to gaze upon these games and see them for anything more than what they are — a couple of pretty good platformers and little else, and that's fine.","Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is an excellent opportunity for more players to get to know the saga. Despite the years, its gameplay is very entertaining, even if the fun factor might be short-lived due to their short stories.",,,,"Are you looking for a platform game that is both colorful and original? Then Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is probably for you! On this compilation which brings together the first two opuses of the Klonoa series, Bandai Namco and the Monkey Craft studio deliver a solid redesign work, especially notable on the founding part. Despite a simple technique, the levels are colorful and very enjoyable to navigate. Of course, the level design remains that of a title from the end of 1990 and the beginning of 2000, which is felt in particular on Klonoa 1. Despite everything, the epic is enchanting and finds its climax during the second episode. In short, a nice nostalgic parenthesis!",,,,,Quotation forthcoming.,,,,,"A straightforward remaster of two literally straightforward platformers, retaining the childlike wonder and charm, making it a dream for anyone to visit.

If you're willing to deal with some frustrations from dated design, you may find yourself head over heels for this loveable Dream Warrior, no questions asked.","Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Collection demonstrates both why these games are fondly remembered and why Klonoa didn’t go on to become more famous. Flawed gems perhaps, but important ones.","Even when accounting for slight hiccups, such as odd audio balancing in Door to Phantomile, there are no significant obstructions to enjoyability present here. Performance on PlayStation 5 was also smooth, if that was a concern. I’m eager to see this highly-anticipated duology sell well, so Klonoa can potentially become a new fixture in the platforming pantheon.",,,"Despite being light on extras, Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series delivers lovingly tuned-up remasters that honor and improve the source material.",,,"Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is a great excuse to recover two gorgeous platformers without having to tinker with old consoles or spend a fortune. A double remastering of the first two chapters released on PlayStation consoles, perhaps a little too intrusive the one applied on Door to Phantomile, which loses its characteristic 2D pixel art style on 3D modeled backgrounds, but all in all pleasant. Too bad for the lack of care shown for the outline, in particular UI and font of the texts, but it is an excellent birthday present for the 25 years of Klonoa, who after a quarter of a century still proves to be one of the most adorable and iconic from the PlayStation era.","Klonoa: Phantasy Reverie Series is the best chance to play two iconic games from the past, two platformers that remain modern and unique.",,,,,"Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series certainly is the best way for the series to celebrate its 25th anniversary, as with the great improvements it has received, the series is back in the spotlight.

You’ll just wish the rewards were more substantial.",,,,,,,,"The Phantasy Reverie series also offers an Easy mode that cuts the damage you receive in half and gives you infinite lives to retry the more challenging sections of the game.

The precision that is needed to meander through waves of enemies and platforming challenges sometimes seems overwhelming. However, when you finally overcome that tricky section you have been dying over and over on for a while, the feeling is magnificent. The PlayStation 5 updates really enhance Ghostrunner, especially the Dualsense controller, I do feel this is the best place to play this unique title.",,,,,,,,,,,"In sum, Ghostrunner on PS5 takes what was already a pretty compelling game and spruces it up just a very little bit. This is a short, narrowly-focused game that is built for speed — to that end, it does very well, but just know that going in and don’t expect a full-blown FPS-like experience. That in mind, I think you’ll appreciate what the devs were able to accomplish here.",,,,"While the fast loading times and updated graphics show off the beauty of Dharma City's neon-grunge aesthetic and keep players in the action, it's ultimately the same experience. Screen Rant's first Ghostrunner review perfectly sums up the PS5 version's experience, in that it's ""Sometimes Fast, Sometimes Slow."" Ghostrunner is a great game that provides a proper adrenaline rush when everything works as intended, but those hoping for any significant changes in this next-gen version will be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It may have a half-baked premise, but don’t let that put you off of Ghostrunner.

Ryza and her companions are some of the best this franchise has seen. With a bigger focus on story, combat, and character progression, Atelier Ryza 2 feels more like an overall RPG experience rather than just a crafting simulator. It's not a perfect game by any means and it does suffer from some issues but they in no way hamper the overall experience.",,,,,,"This PS5 entry in the Atelier series delivers gorgeous anime-style visuals, which its alchemy mechanics make it easy to create equipment of the highest rank, making the speedy and dynamic combat a lot of fun. That being said, the game’s design can sometimes feel a bit too much on the user-friendly side, which can make the exploration feel tedious. While most of the story depicts the characters’ everyday lives, be prepared for a dramatic ending.",,,,,,"It all adds up to a beautiful experience in Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy. There’s a bit of a learning curve with the game’s synthesis and battle systems, but Atelier Ryza 2 is a game that is easy going enough to allow you to take your time to truly get a handle on everything it has to offer (which is a lot). I was already eyeing the 1:7 Scale PVC Ryza statue that’s available next month.

Rarely does anything detract from the joy of stepping into Ryza’s shoes and simply existing in this gorgeous world. There’s so much to do, and every element of the game – from exploring, to crafting, to combat – is immersive and rewarding. It’s a shame there’s no English voice acting, and a bit more direction would be helpful at times, but even with those faults, Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy remains a delightful way to spend 40+ hours of your life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Although I still prefer the original, Atelier Ryza 2 is a wonderful experience that fans of the first game will love.

We are witnessing a script written on a corner of the table, an interventionist adventure full of empty dungeons, and uninspired conversations between characters of all kinds. It is the sad impression of a forced march towards naive and insipid general public standards which destroy the charm of yesteryear. However, we take a lot of fun in the fights and with the flawless alchemy system that appears more than ever as the last bulwark before the general collapse.",,,"Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & The Secret Fairy is an accessible RPG that fans of the series will appreciate. There’s not a huge challenge for much of the adventure, but then Atelier Ryza doesn’t bill itself as being particularly demanding. The tactics mixed in with real-time battling is a good mix, and other quality of life aspects help to move the player along the rather lengthy campaign. Hundreds of side quests flesh out the story for those who wish to be fully engrossed in the world, while those who prefer to stick to the main plot can easily do so. A lack of next-generation features isn’t surprising to see this early on in the PS5’s lifecycle, but at least load times are non-existent here.

There’s a significant focus on exploration in this entry that makes it feel like a real adventure with limited backtracking and more emphasis and discovery. The battle system is amazing and fluid, if only lacking inaccessibility for its more nuanced systems, and the narrative features relatable moments of reuniting with friends for one more adventure. If you enjoyed the first entry, Atelier Ryza 2 does all of that and more, which is all I could have asked for in a sequel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The predecessor’s upward trend is continued.

With any luck, Sega continues the trend with other classics.",,,"Sonic origins is a solid retro remaster collection stacked with some of the best platformers from gaming’s history. The return of Sonic 3 and Knuckles is amazing and the versions of Sonic 1, 2 and CD are as good as they were on mobile.

But they all share a certain magic that means we return to them, time and time again, year after year; that's why this collection exists, after all. And it's thanks to this collection that yet more players, young and old, are going to be able to enjoy these classics. Hardcore Sonic fans will rue the music changes in Sonic 3, for sure, but everything else new or tweaked here is for the better. Sonic's 3D offerings over the years have been sketchy at best, but as long as we can still enjoy his origins, we'll love him regardless.",,,,,,"As a compilation, it's not as complete as we would have loved, but what you get here is a pretty solid update to classic games. Good control, vibrant graphics and some interesting extras keep our interest.","Sega is straight-up hooked on compilations. Their old catalogue has come out on everything from the PS2 to the Mini Genesis. You almost certainly own half the games in this collection several times over. On the other hand, Sonic 3 and Sonic CD are two terrific games that deserve your attention. Plus, Sega has done an admirable job in filling this collection with bonus content. And we can't overlook the accessibility win that is Anniversary Mode. While there are a lot of old Sonic games that deserve this treatment more, Sonic Origins has earned a place of sorts. If you're looking for a glittery shrine to Sonic's 2D era, this collection has got you covered.",,,"Sonic Origins is a collection of classic Sonic games at their best. Extras such as missions, animated cut-scenes and Sonic 3 & Knuckles ""remastered"" in 16:9 also appeal mainly to those who already know the original games. However, the price is very high for what the package offers and is far from being a definitive collection.",,"Call it my unyielding love for the franchise, but Sega needs to amp up their game if they want to earn my respect back. Sorry Sega, but a few new animated cutscenes I can watch on YouTube for free and a bunch of hackneyed ports of games I’ve purchased dozens of times aren’t enough to justify the price tag. Going back to the song “It Doesn’t Matter,” maybe someone should let Sega know that pride comes before the fall.",,"While it’s not quite what I had hoped for, Sonic Origins is one of the best ways to play Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic CD, Sonic 2, and Sonic 3 & Knuckles. The sprite art looks fantastic in widescreen and extras like animated cutscenes bookending each game are a delight.","Sonic Origins isn't a comprehensive collection of Sonic games, as some of the 16-bit entries are missing. It also isn't the definitive version of these games, especially since the music for Sonic the Hedgehog 3 seems to be the sticking point for re-releases. What you have are four games that add a good deal of quality-of-life changes without changing anything else that made the Sonic games classics in the first place. If you can get over the initial asking price and confusion over the versions and are a fan of the older Sonic games, this one is worth a spin.",,,"Sonic Origins keeps the focus on the hedgehog's early core entries, polishing them up to a fine sheen and creating an addictive ecosystem around them that breathes new life into each title. There are a few missteps and grubby mechanics to forgive, but otherwise this is well worth diving into for old-school Sonic fans.",,,"Sonic Origins does an excellent job with its presentation, bonus content, and modernizations of classic games. On the other hand, I wish more games were included even if they didn't get the royal treatment that the 4 titles here did.","An exciting journey through time, Sonic Origins gets it right by including four of the most important games of the Sonic series in one collection for the new generation of consoles. Nostalgia will hit you and it's gonna be a lot of fun for those who love the most famous hedgehog in the world.",,,,,,,"Sonic Origins presents four of the hedgehog's best games with style, and it's a joy to revisit these iconic platformers. Presentational flourishes like the animated cutscenes, as well as a host of extra modes like Boss Rush and Missions, give fans and newcomers alike plenty to see and do, and the Museum is full of interesting artwork you might not have seen before. Some stingy DLC practices let the side down, and of course, the games themselves have some 30-year-old weaknesses, but this is by-and-large a wonderful spin down memory lane.","Sonic Origins does justice to Sonic's legacy, telling his story through its distinctive game mechanics and new animations that refresh the iconic formula. The games feel the way you remember them, with perhaps more precise controls. The different game modes in Sonic Origins will allow you to get out of the routine and give yourself a moment of fun and nostalgia.","An unfortunate collection of great games. The individual Sonic titles are fine, as fun as they always have been throughout the years. The collection in itself doesn’t really add anything, however, and is really pricey for what it offers.",,"A competent but flawed compilation of the four best Sonic the Hedgehog games, which adds a half-hearted modern twist to the classic games.","Although it is a nice homage to the first adventures of the hedgehog, Sonic Origins could have deserved a better finish. Overall, this compilation is correct, but the options offered are not enough to make up for certain shortcomings. Despite a really successful dressing with its cartoons and colorful interface, SEGA's game constantly oscillates between good and bad. We're having a good time, but for Sonic's 30th anniversary, we were right to expect more games and surprises. Especially at a price of forty euros.",,,,,,"The 16:9 format in anniversary mode provides a much better overview when playing, the performance is great, unlimited lives in anniversary mode prevent frustration for newcomers and the numerous extras such as the 60 challenge missions, the new intro and outro cutscenes, the mirror mode that can be unlocked and the museum mode fit in well. Sadly Tails' AI isn’t very reliable, a few features known from fan-remakes are missing (like a save-state function) and the two DLC packages leave a stale aftertaste. What remains is a not error-free, but nevertheless entertaining collection of Sonic hits.",,,,"Great conversions wrapped up in a ‘basic at best, annoying at worst’ wrapper. The core games are still top-tier, but the package lacks the Mania love. [Issue#17, p.91]",,"Sonic Origins' issues may have been excusable at a lower price point. But this little content at $40, plus a gouging-by-DLC headache, moves our call from ""maybe"" to ""nope.""",,,,,,,"It may not offer enough to draw in repeat customers, but Sonic Origins is still a solidly put-together package of classic Blue Blur adventures.","Great collection, good remaster and plenty of options to enjoy the games or spend hours going through its collection of extras.",,,,,,Sonic Origins goes all-out in paying tribute to the iconic franchise's early years.,,,"Sonic Origins is a must-have collection for fans old and new of the lightning-fast SEGA icon. The collection is designed to pay homage to and celebrate the beloved blue hedgehog, as well as to readjust the visual presentation without sacrificing the exquisitely vintage taste of the classic. The work of revising the original format in 16: 9 is nothing short of commendable, while the content offer - which offers different and intriguing replayability solutions - seemed abundant and adequate to the list price. The only blemish on the operation in our opinion is the decision to package some additional content in the form of paid DLC. A very questionable distribution choice which, however, given the cost at which it is proposed, we feel we can partly justify.",,,,"That aside, Sonic Origins is the best collection of Sonic games around. As ever, the games are accessible and easy to play, and the beautifully animated cutscenes breathe some new life into it.",,"A near perfect collection of the first four Sonic games, which can be played in remastered or classic mode. It also includes a lot of other modes like missions, boss rush and mirror modes.",,,,,,"Sonic Origins brings great versions of legendary games from the Mega Drive era, Sonic 1, Sonic 2 Sonic 3 & Knuckles and even Sonic CDs are finally playable on the big screens again, with a lot of additional content and quality of life changes that old-school fans will appreciate. A couple of minor issues will eventually be patched but the only thing we can’t forgive is what they did with Sonic 3's music.","Sonic is the hero of my childhood! I grew up with 2D platformers and my Mega Drive with games is now well protected in a glass cabinet in the living room. Accordingly, I approached Sonic Origins with hope. Sega would have had the chance to interest younger players and offer old fans a little added value. But they missed it cleanly. For new players, 40 euros for four old games will be too much. At the same time, the collection offers almost nothing new for fans. Sure, the scans of the old manuals and developer sketches are nice, but they are nothing more than some fluff on top. The versions of the games work good on PS 5 and still play fantastically, but they are only warmed up and nothing here is original from the Mega Drive. This is simply unworthy of these classics of gaming history.",,,,,,"Sonic Origins is a bit of a disappointment. As a massive Sonic fan, it kills me to say it but it’s true. Sure, the games collected here are undeniably great titles in their own right. But they are no better than the originals which can be found for little or no cost elsewhere already. Sonic 3 and Knuckles is considerably worse both in gameplay as well as its new soundtrack and most of the unlockable content in the Museum can be found easily via other means. For gamers that have never played Sonic and are averse to obtaining these titles on other platforms, you likely will not be as disappointed as I was, but I think SEGA and Sonic Team could have gone a little further and given these titles the proper Sonic Mania treatment. In fact, if you are new to Sonic go for the Mania instead.",,,,"Sonic Origins takes us back to that time where it had strong competition from Nintendo's Mario Bros. This time we have four games adapted for this gen and the ability to play it with Sonic, Tails and Knuckles. This is the best way to enjoy these classics.",,,,,"While the music changes and audio mishaps are disappointing, the Sonic Origins package is terrific overall. Having the best versions of the classic Sonic saga in one bundle is supremely satisfying, and Anniversary Mode’s enhancements make the experience of playing through them more enjoyable than ever before. Even in a gaming landscape where most of these games are already available to download on every platform, Sonic Origins is a worthwhile package.",,,"Sonic Origins is a definitive anniversary title that delivers everything I want from a series’ remaster. While a few more customization options and restored songs would’ve put it over the top, technical updates polish these four emeralds for a new generation.","Sonic Collection is not only a (guess what?) collection of the first games featuring the blue hedgehog and friends cleverly remastered and with an improved gameplay, but it’s also a long platformer – if we consider the Story mode which will take us by hand through all four chapters – which I would recommend also to those who are unfamiliar with the franchise and are simply looking for a fun and fast paced game with colorful graphics and an awesome level design where there’s always something new to discover. Highly recommended both for Sonic lovers and newcomers.",,,,,,,,,,,"Sonic Origins is not only an excellent trip down memory lane for fans of the series, it’s also the perfect entry point for those looking to play them for the very first time. The games are all as beautiful as ever and control like a dream. There are also a plethora of bonus goodies that celebrate the iconic artwork and music of the platforming series. While it’s easy to get caught up in arguments about the current direction of the Sonic IP, Sonic Origins is a refreshing reminder that the original games are among the best 2D platformers ever made.",,,,"The four games contained in Sonic Origins are excellent. More than 30 years later, they've aged quite well, and Sonic Origins is the best possible way to revisit them, or play them for the very first time. Playing all four games, I was taken aback by how Sonic Team was able to make each game feel distinctive. However, after all the reissues some of these games seen, long-time Sonic fans will have to decide if the collection's extras and changes are worth the price of admission. Of course, now that Sonic Origins has been released, I sincerely hope that Sega offers similar packages for other Sonic games. If the company ever decides to give the Sonic Advance games a similar treatment, I'll be first in line.",,,,"Despite being let down by egregious DLC and some lacking options, Sonic Origins stands tall as a collection of four absolute classics. Feeling like they haven’t aged a day, each game has its own flair and ideas, but they all still work together to form something magical, as each game’s design makes speeding through every level incredibly enjoyable. Curious new players owe it to themselves to try Origins, but series veterans won’t find nearly as much on offer.",,,,,,,,"Sonic Origins does well by Sega’s classics, but only to a point. While the action feels true to the 16-bit originals, an abbreviated list of games, lack of features and archival goodies, and frustrating crashes keep this collection a step short of greatness. Hardcore Sonic fans looking to relive some of the hedgehog’s best games in widescreen HD ought to have fun, but others may wish Sega had reached harder for that shiny gold ring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’re a Sonic fan, you’ve probably owned at least one of these games in the past, but it’s nice to see the four games from the Genesis era finally bundled in a single collection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
metal-hellsinger,,,,,,,,"A solid, well executed rhythm action shooter that keeps things simple to provide a fun and replayable experience. Metal Hellsinger fires on most cylinders, with only an issue of variety scuppering the overall package. Come in for the blistering soundtrack from some of Metal’s greats. Stay for the moreish gameplay a heavenly combo, despite the hellish subject matter.",,,,,"Metal: Hellsinger is an absolute head-banger of a game with amazing tracks to accompany each level, but it's rhythm-based gameplay does little to stop it from constantly reminding you of the games that inspired it, games that are fundamentally better executed in their core gameplay. It's repetitiveness and lack of any innovation doesn't make it a must-play game for shooter fans, but it's music does for any heavy metal fan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With vocals from the likes of Trivium’s Matt Heafy and System of a Down’s Serj Tankian, the music of Metal: Hellsinger will go down a treat with metal fans. The fact that it’s married with gameplay that is equally impressive, then, should speak volumes. This is a unique first-person shooter that not only uses music to drive the action, but also uses it as a reward. And with both music and gameplay of such a high standard, only those who absolutely abhor metal need not jump in.","Metal Hellsinger is a refreshing take on traditional demon killing, Doom shooting, and rhythm based heavy death metal music. It features some truly immersive and satisfying gameplay mechanics, especially when you click with the beat and blow off demon heads while rocking out to the beat of System of a Down. However, the game’s difficult learning curve and lack of variety may be off putting to some.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ultimately, you have a game with one masterfully designed core element — the rhythm gunplay — surrounded by a number of elements that, while not terrible, are mediocre at best.",,,,,"In its way of transforming the fast FPS into a raging rhythm game, thanks to the support of an impeccable soundtrack, Metal: Hellsinger gave us a few hours of pure adrenaline. The gameplay loop is mastered, the instinctive handling and the multiple levels of difficulty allow you to create an à la carte experience. The fact remains that the content is a little too light, since we will complete the main campaign in 5 to 6 hours depending on the desired challenge. The challenges, however, allow you to extend the lifespan, but it is above all the interest in scoring and the desire to climb the world rankings that will allow you, or not, to play Metal: Hellsinger for more than 10 hours. As it is, it's still an experience to try if you like ""Doom Like"" and big guitar riffs.",,"There isn’t anything like Metal: Hellsinger. Diehard metal fans will no doubt fall in love with it instantly, but the overall experience is satisfying and compelling enough to serve as a gateway into the metal genre for newcomers. It perfectly embodies the passion, energy, and emotion that all metalheads share.",,"I finished Metal: Hellsinger wanting more, and honestly, that isn’t a bad thing. For the money you’re paying I do have to question its price tag, but what you’re getting here is a hard-hitting package of rhythmic, raucous violence. If the devs at The Outsiders can tighten up its weapon and level design for any future entries, then the future of FPS games may become hell for other franchises.",,,,,,"The story may not tempt you back, but the formidable soundtrack and combat will. This is the Doom/Guitar Hero mash-up we didn’t know we wanted. [Issue#20, p.83]",,,,,,,,"Metal: Hellsinger is the first-person shooter/rhythm game mashup I had no idea I wanted. Being a fan of metal helps as metalheads are clearly the target demographic, but the developers didn’t use metal as a gimmick to sell an unremarkable game. The gameplay in Metal is fast paced and unforgiving where the player constantly has to fight for their own survival. This a great first-person shooter regardless of what an individual’s taste in music might be. Metal: Hellsinger combines great FPS and rhythm game mechanics in way that brings challenging and rewarding gameplay to a hellscape any metalhead would love to visit.",,,,"Metal: Hellsinger is exactly what I hoped it would be – a balls to the wall, headbanging, visceral experience that nails the aesthetic and feel of the premise. The soundtrack is superb and perfectly suits the setting and narrative, and everything is carried along by an interesting and well-voiced narrative. Even if you are not a big fan of metal (and why the Hell wouldn’t you be?) this is an excellent rhythm shooter that absolutely slays.",,,"An absolute blast of a rhythm-based shooter, Metal: Hellsinger is a love letter to all those that throw their horns to the sky.

Unfortunately, the genius of the idea on which it was built is not adequately supported by an up-to-date technical and artistic sector and this makes the product only half successful. In any case, it is impossible not to turn a blind eye to some technical issues, also because the title is not only included in the Xbox Game Pass catalog for PC and consoles, but is also sold at a negligible price, since it can be added to your digital library for just over 16 euros.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lemnis Gate is a game at odds with itself. Its well-executed time loop mechanics could potentially appeal beyond the usual hardcore shooter crowd, but the game’s matchmaking shortcomings and lack of single-player content will keep that wider audience at arm’s length.

I can fully understand that SIE San Diego’s attention was focused on some other super-important considerations this year, though.

With a masterful visual and audio upgrade and a combat system that, in my opinion, outshines Remakes with its fluidity and ease of use, Crisis Core shouldn't be missed; it's just a shame that the writing remained unchanged, and side content is just as repetitive as it was fifteen years ago.",,"Reunion reunites us with one of our favorite action rpgs of all time; the story of Zack Fair is as humane as ever. This is, in our view, a full blown remake not a simple remaster; literally everything in the game has been improved. You owe it to yourself to play this game.","Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion rescues one of the best PSP videogames, with a remaster that looks like a remake and generates frictions that are hard to ignore. A half-baked work that, yes, is a good opportunity to explore the past of some of the most interesting characters of Midgar.",,"Crisis Core is a good example about what a remaster would be. Better combat, visual improvements, and the same DNA as the original game.","As a prequel to one of gaming’s most beloved classics, Crisis Core did a great job of enriching the original game’s world as an action RPG on the PSP. This remaster not only enhances the visuals but also improves on many of the original’s shortcomings. While there still are some inconveniences, altogether Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is an exhilarating experience from start to finish.",,"Thanks to a series of substantial visual updates, and an improved combat system, Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion stands as the best remaster Square Enix has ever made. This is the definitive version to enjoy the adventure of Zack Fair.",,,,"Final Fantasy 7: Crisis Core Reunion is an excellent remaster that evolves the original game in ways I didn’t think possible, but even that can’t take away from an experience that even in 2007 was holding itself back to satiate the platform it called home. The repetitive combat and clumsy environmental design serve to make this otherwise spectacular world feel strangely artificial, while its campy dialogue and archetypal character writing doesn’t exactly gel with the remake it serves to apply greater context to. New audiences deserve to play this game, and I’m so glad they finally get that chance, but eventual wish fulfillment doesn’t lessen the hurt of inevitable disappointment. Zack is still an adorable puppy I need to protect, though.","Crisis Core Reunion is a fascinating look into the Square Enix of the past, meshed with Final Fantasy 7's current trajectory in the Remake saga. Zack might be a dunce, and the early '00s-era script fails him miserably, but he's utterly loveable by the game's end, far outshining Final Fantasy 7 stalwarts like Aerith, who mostly seem present for their cameo impact. The retooled combat system is Crisis Core Reunion's most impressive upgrade, an elegant and electrifying system that'll always keep you on your toes with smooth Digital Mind Wave implementation. Given Zack’s inevitable role in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Crisis Core Reunion is an essential part of the overarching Remake saga, even if the writing does hold it back.","I can see now why Crisis Core is considered one of the best PSP titles and one of the finest Final Fantasy games ever made. It has been “blown up” and remastered for the PlayStation 5 to the point that it looks and feels like a native title, and has a rich and emotionally impactful narrative that, being entirely honest here, was well beyond what I was expecting. This is another feather in the cap for Square Enix, which has had one of its finest years ever.","Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 Reunion still has its place in the hearts of many veterans of the series and Final Fantasy 7's world, and maintains its relevance to the FF7 Remake series. However, the original Crisis Core also received a lot of justified criticism, and Reunion doesn't do much to address those points. It's nice to have a prettier, more functional and more accessible version of this PSP prequel, but it's still hard to recommend it as a game. Fans who got into the series because of FF7 Remake are going to experience an obvious gap in quality and may be left wondering what all the excitement was about. Zack's tragic tale deserved a better retelling on modern hardware, and Crisis Core Reunion ultimately feels like a missed opportunity.","Crisis Core has been always fierce action RPG with great story background for iconic FF7 title. But Reunion brings it closer to recent reimagination of the legend in terms of engine and production values, but maintains its unique gameplay with DMW system in combat or hundreds of fast side missions.","Crisis Core Reunion has plenty to offer as a remaster, with improved visuals and tighter combat than the PSP original. The fragmented structure of the game, however, remains more suited to a handheld machine, and a poor English script is sadly unchanged. If you’re hankering for more Final Fantasy VII, though, it’s well worth diving in.","Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is an absolutely key and necessary piece to be able to fully absorb the essence of the Final Fantasy VII remake. Although this game does not have the same depth as the official remake of the first part in terms of changes made, Square Enix has done a phenomenal job to make the figure of Zack Fair enjoy and adapt like a charm in the middle of 2022.","A 15-year old title brought back as a tasty appetizer for those who can’t wait for the second part of the new Final Fantasy VII, Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is a very good remake with an addictive combat system. You can tell it’s a smaller-scale game designed for PSP, but it was remade with love and although it won’t change anyone’s life, Final Fantasy VII fans will definitely enjoy it.",,"Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is a beautiful remake of a good-but-not-great game. Its structure is more well-suited for the platform it originated on, and several of the one-shot gameplay concepts it introduces don’t really land as well as they probably did in 2007. Still, it’s got charm, and I love the unpredictable nature of the DMW and how it impacts the solid combat mechanics. I don’t think Zack’s adventure will resonate with me for as long as Cloud’s did, but I am happy to have been given a chance to get to know him better before he pops up in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.",,,,,,"As HD remasters go, Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion goes above and beyond what’s expected in many regards. Its visuals have been lovingly brought up to date, and the combat has been tweaked to make it much more palatable to modern audiences. But some aspects of it, like its suffocating linearity, haven’t aged well at all. And then there’s Zack’s terrible voice acting. Still, if you’ve never played this chapter of the Final Fantasy VII story, or wish to re-live it, this is the best way to do so.","I’ll never forget my first playthrough of Crisis Core back in 2007 and I’ll also never forget my Reunion with it in 2022. Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is a triumphant example from both Square Enix and Tose of how an excellent remaster should look. If you can look past some outdated game design choices and see this as a faithful recreation instead, then you can truly appreciate what this game has to offer. This is a must-play for any fan of the Final Fantasy VII universe.","In short, Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is a very fun action-RPG with a remarkable story and a loveable hero in Zack Fair. There’s plenty of side content and the combat is satisfying with a welcome hint of uncertainty. While its appeal is big enough for a total newcomer to play, its true brilliance is only really visible to fans of Final Fantasy VII. When you know what comes after, everything in Reunion becomes more meaningful, resulting in a must-play title.","Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion is an entertaining spinoff with action packed combat, but at this point it's showing its age a little.",,"Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is a fine remaster for those wanting to experience the story of Zack Fair before Rebirth comes out. This is however a by the books remaster including all of the cringeworthy dialogue and stiff animations. The new additions and graphical upgrades are really good, but don't expect this to be on the same level as 2020's FFVII Remake.","Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion is more than a remaster, yes, but just in some ways. In many others, it's still the same PSP game... for better and for worse. Nevertheless, this is the best version to discover Zack's story... or to reunite with an old friend.",,,,"Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is a masterclass in how to do a remaster, vastly improving every little aspect of the original game without changing its essence. If the original was already one of the best games on the PSP, this remaster can easily be considered one of the best JRPGs on PS4 and PS5, offering a story, gameplay, visuals and soundtrack worthy of the best games of the genre of all time.",,,,,"Final Fantasy 7: Crisis Core Reunion manages to be a lot more than the sum of its parts. There are a lot of things that you can complain about, from the dumb antagonist to the legacy of its PSP roots. It's a credit to the game that despite those flaws, it is still probably one of the best Final Fantasy spin-off games on the market, and Reunion is by far the best way to experience it. It should do a good job of tiding over fans until at least Final Fantasy XVI.",,,"Not quite a remake, but well beyond what's expected of a remaster, Crisis Core Reunion is exactly the kind of reverent and carefully-considered re-release that fans of the original deserve. Not everything from the 2008 iteration holds up equally, but the updates are plentiful enough that it hardly matters. Whether you managed to catch it on the PSP or you're diving in for the first time – this is without a doubt the definitive way to experience the excellent prequel to Final Fantasy VII.","While not a remake like the appropriately named Final Fantasy VII: Remake, Crisis Core is a 100% labor of love, taking the original game and cleaning it up while only making a few changes that allow people who never had a PSP to experience this somewhat hard to access chapter of Final Fantasy’s lore. The graphics are gorgeous, the gameplay is smooth and fun, the structure of the game respects your time, and Cissnei is in it which is worth the cost of admission itself.",Crisis Core Reunion offers a fantastic graphical upgrade and gameplay improvements while still showing its PSP roots.,"CRISIS CORE -FINAL FANTASY VII- REUNION is one of the best remasters out there thanks to its complete presentational overhaul and when you have such a great base game to work with, you're left with an action RPG that even rivals modern examples of the genre.",,,,"FF7 Crisis Core Reunion is a remaster like no others. The graphical improvements and the more nervous, dynamic and fluid combat system work wonders. However, the game keeps all the weaknesses of the time and all them are unchanged. A respectful which would have deserved to be completely overhauled as the stigma of the PSP era can be painful to see and play. FF7 Crisis Core Reunion is neither more nor less than an old school game with an angelic face that stills has some charm.",,"The return of a PSP classic we could not have wished for better. The graphics upgrade is very pleasant and the performance is excellent. In addition, the combat system is more than fluid and the New Game+ option is a welcome addition. Add to that a compelling story and characters and you have a must have up your sleeve. That the development regarding the latter is sometimes not deep enough is a bit of a shame, as are the here and there outdated animations, but that is fine to take for granted in this excellent remaster that is more than a graphical polish.",,"Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is a top tier remaster of a flawed and often comically awkward spinoff. But for all of its angsty melodrama, the story of Zack Fair is an endearingly daft tale that only adds to the world of Final Fantasy VII. It's hard not to enjoy the blatant fan service and completely over-the-top cinematics, while the overhauled combat system is infinitely better than it once was. A worthy second chance.","Square Enix revives one of the most beloved PSP games in a formidable way. The appearance of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion could not be better, especially on the current consoles. The game mechanics should have received a significant adjustment to make the experience much more modern. Zack Fair's story is worth re-enjoying, especially if you've finished Final Fantasy VII Remake.",A beautiful looking remaster which doesn’t manage to significantly upgrade its source material in aspects other than graphics. Only faithful Final Fantasy VII fans who didn’t get to play it on the PSP will leave truly satisfied.,"Crisis Core Reunion falls short of the level of FF7 Remake. However, it is a very good remaster of the PSP game that was painfully outdated in some areas. Anyone with a penchant for Final Fantasy 7 should not miss this.","An inspired piece of Final Fantasy 7 fan service, and a very good remaster, but as a standalone game the story and gameplay has very little value.","Between the remaster and the remake, Crisis Core Reunion brilliantly brings up to date one of the best games on the PSP. Thanks to graphics at the height of Final Fantasy VII Remake, we make the most of the touching adventure of Zack, a character still as charismatic and endearing. Far from being a simple visual facelift, the gameplay is also modernized through more flexible controls and comfort options that make combat more dynamic and fluid than ever. And if we find all the elements that made the strength of the original experience like its materia system, certain flaws persist like its rushed story at times, its linear structure or even its phases of play which are not all equal. Not enough to spoil this beautiful story which remains a central stone in the universe of Final Fantasy VII and which should play an important role in Rebirth, the sequel to FFVII Remake, scheduled for next year.",,"Though I would have liked to see Square Enix make more drastic changes to the overall formula, Crisis Core has never looked or felt better to play. Zack’s story is gripping, hopeful, and emotionally devastating. So despite a few minor flaws, Crisis Core Reunion feels like “essential reading” for anyone interested in Final Fantasy VII and the ongoing Remake project.","Crisis Core Reunion is not quite a remaster and not quite a remake. The upgraded visuals breathe new life into the game, but there are little reminders here and there of its PSP origins. However, with a $50 price point, Square Enix is at least somewhat acknowledging that it’s not rebuilt from the ground up. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will almost certainly reference events from Crisis Core. So, a playthrough is practically required for those looking forward to the next installment of the FF7 Remake series. Considering the condition of some of Square Enix’s past remasters, Crisis Core Reunion impresses. I hope this is an indicator we can expect the company to take more care with this sort of title in the future.",,,,,,,"A neat remaster that sometimes clashes with its PSP origins. More often than not, it comes out on top, but it feels like it could have broken more limits. [Issue#23, p.74]",A more ambitious redesign is missing. Its portable game structure from fifteen years ago makes it limited as an RPG.,,"Despite something of an overdeveloped plot, Crisis Core Reunion goes beyond just a quick upgrade, making some fundamental improvements to visuals, sound and controls, and implements them with care. There are flaws, but it remains a joy to spend time with favourites Cloud, Aerith, and Sephiroth once more. [Eurogamer Recommended]",,"For all of its strengths, Crisis Core is ultimately too obsessed with itself to serve as a perfect prequel. The game’s core narrative is an excellent half or three-quarters of a story. The final plot arc, however, fails to recognize that VII is its own story with its own characters. Crisis Core’s depiction of VII’s characters, and its refusal to stop shoving new characters into existing narratives, makes for a disappointing conclusion.",,,"This remaster improves on what needed to be updated such as graphics and gameplay mechanics, but realizes the story and pacing were fine how they were. Crisis Core is still a fifteen-year-old game originally designed for a handheld platform and as such the improvements to this version can’t erase all reminders of its origins. Even with game elements that show their age, however, this is the best way to experience Crisis Core.","Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is a wonderful remaster of the first part of the Final Fantasy VII story, and the move from handheld to the TV screen, along with new graphics and voice acting, makes this a solid starting point for fans who may have never had the pleasure of meeting these iconic characters.","This is, without a doubt, the best version of this unforgettable adventure. A PSP game at its core, but with many new features that make it feel much more modern.","Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is a perfect example of a remaster done right, as the game brings Zack's story to a new generation of consoles in a way that both preserves the original's experience and improves upon it in every way, thanks to the addition of a few new mechanics and features, as well it's stunning overall presentation.","Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion is essential gaming for Final Fantasy fans — not only because it brings a much beloved game into the modern day, but also because Zack was heavily teased ahead of the next instalment of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy.","Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is a brilliant example of what a Remaster should be. It's the same game I remember, but the updated graphics, controls, and combat make it so much more. You might feel fatigued with the respective mission structure, but there's so much for new and old fans to enjoy in this release, and I'm happy that it received the level of attention it deserves. This is a must-play game for any who truly wishes to understand the incredible narrative of Final Fantasy VII and what makes it so great.","Crisis Core: Reunion is much better than expected. it provided authentic content for players with great graphics and combat system. It's still a must-play masterpiece for ""FF7"" fans. It can be said that ""Reunion"" provides an almost perfect version for old players who want to replay ""Crisis Core"". For new players starting from ""FF7 Remake"" and wanting to know more about the story, now is the best time to experience it.","Crisis Core -Final Fantasy 7- Reunion is a prime example of how remasters should be handled. A massive graphical overhaul, streamlined and satisfying gameplay mechanics and wonderfully remastered soundtrack outweigh the 2007 originals flaws in bloated side-content and repetitive structure. Square Enix have kept their honour and given Zack Fair the hero treatment he deserves.","Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion is an impressive visual upgrade that, above all else, proves the quality of the original game yet again. Much of it can feel dated at times, but thanks primarily to its enjoyable combat system, it remains an easy game to recommend.",,"Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion is an excellent revival of the beloved PSP game with outstanding visuals, music and quality of life improvements, but Square Enix could not remake the boring side missions and some of the oddest story bits.","Between HD remastering and complete remake, Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion is a thick reissue that keeps the valuable narrative component of the original unchanged, today more than ever essential to fully understand the increasingly complex mythology of the seventh fantasy the final. By intervening on the fluidity of the combat system and even reworking the infamous OMD system, Square Enix has managed to rejuvenate and improve a still valid play system. On the flip side, however, the graphic restoration was only partially successful, as the landscapes and polygonal models of the secondary characters would have needed touch-ups of a much different entity. While waiting for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth to reach the launch pad, Crisis Core still represents an obligatory stop for fans of the saga, perhaps even more than it was fifteen years ago.","Despite some balancing problems that simplify the game difficulty, Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 - Reunion is a work of love that respects the original game and its unforgettable story.",,,,,,,,"Repackaged into one of the sharpest Remaster releases I’ve ever seen, it’s a relatively irresistible package - warts and all. The blemishes upon its carefully airbrushed visage are, in many ways, part of the charm. This is a joyous little time capsule of 2000s Square - and perhaps a curious aperitif before Remake part 2. It’s easy to recommend.",,"Even when its portable roots occasionally distract, Crisis Core –Final Fantasy 7– Reunion is the best way to play one of the PSP’s most beloved games, almost completely modernizing its graphics, combat, and music in the process.",Crisis Core Reunion is without a doubt the best way you can today to experience this very important Final Fantasy VII prequel that has been trapped on the PSP until now.,,"An excellent game in its own right, and one of the PSP’s best, Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII’s remaster stands shoulder to shoulder still with some of the best and most enjoyable JRPGs of the modern day. There are certainly some aspects that have aged poorly in relation to other aspects, but the core pillars of the experience sing as loudly and as strongly as they ever have. Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII was already one of the great JRPGs, and a major player in advancing the genre, but now, 15 years on, it’s still right up there with the very best. With Final Fantasy VII hype greater than perhaps it has ever been, now is absolutely the time to check out this all-important prequel chapter.",,,"The rough edges are a reminder of Crisis Core’s charm and its PSP roots, a console that I’ll admittedly always have a soft spot for. Yes, the mini-games are awful but they don’t last very long, and yes, Genesis still sucks, but at least the rest of the cast manages to carry the game. Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion isn’t perfect, but it’s got a lot of heart. And sometimes, that’s enough.",,"For fans of the OG PSP game, Crisis Core Reunion is a fantastic remaster, seeing how meticulously a game can be updated with enough budget behind it. For fans of Final Fantasy VII on PS1, this is an opportunity to play the best game in the original Compilation (no offence to Dirge of Cerberus) on modern consoles. Its many changes and additions help bring these PSP mechanics closer to modern standards and the game is better off for it. For fans of Remake keen to understand more of this world and characters, Crisis Core is a great amuse-bouche before Rebirth launches next year.",,"A faithful remaster of the PSP classic: Game mechanics are a little gray, but atmospherically up to date, it works as a prequel for the original game and remake.","FFVII Reunion is a satisfactory for both who have played the original PSP version or those who have not. From Improved visuals to combat system, the game is ready to entertain your both eyes and hands. Pretty sure it will be the most satisfying year-end gift for FFVII remake fans.","Crisis Core Reunion is one of the few remasters that really takes advantage of the new work that has been put into it. It is not only a new work at the graphic level, but also at the playable level and improvements in the quality of life of the game. It is still an old game but it can be given a chance thanks to its enhancements.",,"CRISIS CORE -FINAL FANTASY VII- REUNION is another success in Square Enix's re-release strategy. It's a release that succeeds at taking an old PSP game and giving it a fresh coat of paint that leaves it shiny for new audiences. At the same time, it stays close enough to the original to be a true nostalgic travel ticket to 2007. As mentioned, there are things that some prefer about the original, but it's wonderful to have an official way to replay Crisis Core, especially when you consider how important Final Fantasy VII will be to Square Enix for years to come.","A good remaster of a video game that suffers the weight of its age, superior to the original in every respect, but not free from defects.",,"For the ongoing Final Fantasy VII re-examination, which Square Enix has officially dubbed the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, Crisis Core feels like required reading. Its place in the larger story is important and will likely grow in significance moving forward, but making your way through those story moments sometimes feels like a school assignment. Reunion is a well-executed remake of the 2007 game that delivers fun combat alongside a stilted story with an interesting and narratively important final act. If you plan on starting or continuing the Final Fantasy VII Remake journey, make sure to do your homework.",,,"If you've ever played a Final Fantasy VII title, this is an essential experience.","Crisis Core Reunion is the prequel that if you haven't played, then you absolutely have to recover and this operation is just for this, to aesthetically insert this chapter in line with the modernization work of the remake of Final Fantasy VII and add a piece for the future of the relative remake. The defects it carries with it are those of a game that - on balance - was released in 2007 on a portable console.",,,"Square Enix and Tose have done a phenomenal job bringing Zack’s origin story to life again after being buried away for so long. Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is everything fans want and expect it to be, with rehauled graphics, improved gameplay mechanics, a new arranged soundtrack, and fully voiced dialogue. If you somehow missed your chance to play this back on the PlayStation Portable back in 2007, then this is the definitive way to experience one of the best prequel stories. It feels like a nostalgic dream to be able to step into the shoes of Zack Fair once again, and I can’t wait to see what’s in store in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.",,,"Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII: Reunion lives up to its promise of being much more than a remaster. With its renewed graphics and gameplay mechanics, it is a game that fans of the series should not miss!",,"Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion is an excellent remaster, that retains the faulty parts of a PSP game.","Crisis Core –Final Fantasy VII– Reunion is a great update to the PSP classic. Numerous changes improve both visuals and gameplay, helping to modernize it for new and returning players. Some elements such as the story, characters, and large number of random battles may not land with everyone, but Square Enix has done an excellent job updating an important title in the Final Fantasy VII compilation, resulting in the definitive version.",,"I had some mixed feelings by the time I rolled credits on Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion. When I played FF7 Remake, I felt like I had played something noticeably grander than its source material. I didn't get that same sensation out of Crisis Core. Instead, I felt like I was playing an updated version of the PSP original. After thinking it over, I ultimately determined that the PSP original was pretty good and given the visual upgrades and the quality-of-life changes, I felt generally satisfied by Reunion. As a whole and in a vacuum, I heartily give this game a thumbs up. To Final Fantasy 7 fans, specifically, I have to say that Reunion is an absolute must play, especially given that nobody knows where this is all heading.","It does feel a little patchwork in places, but Crisis Core is a reunion worth going to. The emotional gut-punch of a finale remains one of the best in the long running series, and that alone is worth the price of admission.","Ultimately, if you go into Crisis Core Reunion expecting a one-for-one remake of Crisis Core, quirks and all, you will not be the slightest bit disappointed. It is a greatly improved version of a great game, one that all Final Fantasy VII fans eager for more story would benefit from playing.

The next-gen versions have received a graphical update and load super fast, but razor-sharp and lifelike movements during a full soccer match will not be available until next year at the earliest.",,,,"FIFA 22 actually feels different from the rest of the franchise, but it's still the same old game. New movement mechanics open up new strategies of scoring, but the AI still feels pretty dumb sometimes. Overall, it's a solid soccer experience that fans likely wont's miss out.",,,,,A superb second next-gen season on the digital turf – but subtle Ultimate Team tweaks amplify the ‘pay to win’ criticisms that stalk this series annually.,,"While FIFA 22's gameplay is still great, its flashy qualities make it fun to watch, and Career Mode & Volta offer some much-needed variety, its core experience feels a little too similar to previous generations of gaming. That's a problem EA will need to solve moving forward.",,,"FIFA 22 introduces us to the biggest gameplay change in years to bring more realism to a game mode that, although it does not need it, does bring it closer to the sport from which it is nourished.","FIFA 22 shows its wasted potential every step of the way. When everything works as it should, it’s the best FIFA in years. The problem is that while sometimes the new HyperMotion technology works great and really makes a noticeable difference, the game often picks wrong animations from its mind-boggling array of 8 million. Let’s hope EA Sports builds on these promising foundations, fixes what needs to be fixed and delivers a truly great experience next year.

But the nefarious gutting of play-to-win rewards in its most popular mode means that the shadow of pay-to-win microtransactions looms ever more over FIFA's latest entry.",,"FIFA 22 features tons of big changes in every element of gameplay, making this year's iteration the best version seen to date.","Fifa 22 is absolutely unmistakably a Fifa game – it has the sophistication and polish we’ve come to expect, with all the player likenesses, authentic stadia and recognisable commentators we see every year. But right at the core of it is a match engine that feels more surefooted than ever, at a time when the game’s more tactically complex rival Pro Evolution Soccer has been relegated to a free-to-play existence with all the compromises that will inevitably entail. If you can live with the loot-box trickery of Ultimate Team, this is a gigantic, rewarding simulation that offers a ton of variety and scope, and many, many moments of exquisite goalmouth drama.","FIFA 22 offers a lot of new elements on next-gen. Gameplay is finally going in a clear direction and provides a clear picture of what to expect from this iteration of FIFA. Even though the gameplay finally seems fine, there are quite a few problems. Career is near unplayable thanks to loads of bugs and glitches, Ultimate Team is still a pay-to-win fest and a lot of modes are clearly less important than cash cow Ultimate Team, which is understandable, but still frustrating.","As a football game, FIFA 22 is very continuist. It doesn’t offer anything spectacular or revolutionary in order to make you stand up from your seat, but it takes profit of its previous knowledge to provide some nice matches.","FIFA 22 is the improvement that many fans have been waiting for. Shifting the focus away from pace, the game has managed to achieve a new level of realism. Due to HyperMotion Technology, players act and move intelligently, increasing strategic possibilities in offensive and defensive scenarios. With a litany of tweaks and refinements, FIFA 22 is the best iteration of the sport in the franchise.","FIFA 22 is a step in the right direction. It can never be in the best, because for that we would have to see changes in FUT's micropayments, but we do see a huge effort to make matches more realistic and a great job to add novelties to the title's various modes.","As the sum of its parts, FIFA 22 is the best FIFA in years…and plays a strong game of football on the PS5. The decision to go more sim-heavy is long overdue, with finally a befitting pace and defensive posture to the beautiful game. Online contests – even with exploits via microtransaction supercharged players – are much more balanced. There’s so much to do both online and offline, it’s an easy recommendation for both casual and committed football fanatics.",,,,"If you've been avoiding FIFA for a long time, this edition is a great opportunity to change that and play some matches on virtual stadiums.

Right?",,,,"After the poor reception of eFootball and the good result obtained by FIFA 22, thanks to realistic changes in the gameplay, FIFA is now the king of soccer games.","FIFA 22 is the best FIFA game in years. HyperMotion pushes the action along, with a renewed focus on Career Mode more than welcome. It’s a more refined, well-developed package this time around, and I’m excited to see where the series is headed in the future.",,"Depending on its edition, FIFA 22 is either the leap into a new generation - of more or less the same ... or the annual insolence.",,,,"FIFA 22 is undoubtedly a step forward for the franchise, and the new Hypermotion engine on new-gen consoles is totally worth it, though it’s pretty clear it’s not everybody’s cup of tea. EA clearly has a lot of things to polish in FIFA 22, and the first update that is already live on PC is the living proof the company is very committed to doing this in the short term.","Doing better than FIFA 21 was inevitable for FIFA 22. And the task has been accomplished, between a pleasant interface to handle, an ever more addicting Ultimate Team mode and more defensive gameplay this time around. But some flaws persist, others have emerged and overall the container remains the same from year to year. If EA has made the choice to reform the form this season, and under conditions that the patches improve and do not destroy what has been put in place, the developer will have to urgently look at the substance, which needs to be fleshed out.",,"We're still waiting for EA to reinvent the wheel and shock us with a refreshing take on virtual football. And while we're doing that, we can enjoy FIFA 22, which once more offers more of the same, adding some tweaks and an extra layer of graphical fidelity. The latter is the main attraction this time, thanks to the brand new HyperMotion technology.",,"FIFA 22 feels like real football, and it’s all the better for it. Impressive improvements to player positioning, ball physics, and animations make for a supremely satisfying simulation that underpins each of the franchise’s flagship modes. Career Mode doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but the ability to create a club is entertaining, and the changes to Player Careers are overdue. Microtransactions still rule supreme in Ultimate Team, and you’ll already have your own personal opinions on that, but there’s so much to do in this year’s release that you could easily invest hundreds of hours into it without seeing a single loot box.","EA delivered a solid soccer game that you should enjoy beyond a simple online match. Both Pro Clubs and Volta received solid upgrades and the created players have an interesting development thanks to the improvements that you can implement in them. Overall, the game mechanics have been polished enough to feel that this year FIFA 22 is very different from other previous deliveries.","FIFA 22 looks amazing on next-gen hardware which was to be expected. What was not to be expected is the brilliant gameplay. It still isn’t a full-blown simulation, of course, but it’s way more tactical and fun than before, including the (in)famous Ultimate Team. The only thing that truly suffers is the neglected Career Mode.","After last year's debacle, Fifa 22 is fortunately taking another step in the right direction. It's far from the level of Fifa 10 or the best parts of the previous generation, but at least it looks like football again.","An ambitious release that focuses on new animations and gameplay innovations but the execution needs refining, whilst matches feel too heavily skewed in favour of defence. [Provisional Score = 70]","The gameplay has therefore managed to take the train of the new generation while the content of FIFA 22, far from the references of the sports genre, is still blocked in the 2010s.",,,"For as much as FIFA 22 has done right with enhancements to the the on-field product, they seem perfectly content to not offer up new ways to engage with the sport. While HyperMotion helps bridge the realism gap that’s been present for a bit, it isn’t quite substantial enough to warrant calling it game-changing. This may be a positive step in the right direction for the franchise, but it’s still quite a ways from genuinely raising the bar.",,"FIFA has changed its face. It's bigger, more realistic, and more jaw-dropping than ever before but it seems to have left behind one important factor: fun.","FIFA 22 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S is definitely the next big step for the series – thanks to its better graphics, overhauled gameplay and a more realistic approach to football. However, Electronic Arts still has to sort out some balancing-issues that come along with the next-gen-technology.","Despite a full year since the launch of the new console generation, FIFA 22 doesn't offer anything groundbreaking, on or off the pitch. The changes are largely minor and exclusive features are not worth fretting over. It plays a solid game of football, as always, but we're still left waiting for a true next-gen leap.",,,"A slower-paced FIFA creates absorbing action that feels like a step forward for the series, but the dominance of FUT is becoming less and less inspiring.

Much like real football, I suppose.",,,,,"The team left no stone unturned for FIFA 22 and went all out in making a supremely-improved football game. The gameplay is the best the series has ever offered and makes the game fun no matter what mode you choose. The managerial career is the stand-out mode here with the ability to create a club and manage every aspect of the team. The player career offers a ton of meaningful upgrades that actually make you feel like you’re accomplishing something. VOLTA has been simplified but made more fun. But it all starts with the gameplay thanks to HyperMotion and the machine learning technology that brings excellent realism to FIFA 22. Even if you’re not a soccer/football fan, the controls of this game make it worth a try to at least play with friends. FIFA 22 may just be the best sports game of this generation so far.",,"FIFA 22 feels like the foundation for the future of FIFA. It still a great game, with no big improvements, but very fun to play.","FIFA 22 proves that EA’s soccer simulator is still the most playable of the genre in the market, but it also demonstrates that they know it. Yet again, the blatant disregard for industry-wide skepticism over microtransactions reigns this year in FIFA. Though there are long-awaited improvements to Career Mode and sharp graphical enhancements, it is hard to see past the decision to continue rinsing the most dedicated players of their cash.",,,"FIFA 22 has improved the feel and smoothness of actions, but there are almost no changes in the game mode and gameplay. The reduction of stand-alone content makes it not very suitable as the first FIFA entry for newcomers.",,,,,"The EA Sports revolution comes to life in FIFA 22 for next gen, but in our opinion we are facing a starting point and certainly not a goal for Canadian football. The innovations guaranteed by Hypermotion Technology, a real pillar of this year's offer, give the scenic impact and gameplay a realism that is unprecedented for the series. Unfortunately, the refinement in the animations and the artificial intelligence tricks clash with the idea of football that Electronic Arts has been repeating for a decade now: spectacular and frenetic, but too fast and not very inclined to strategy. In addition to the technical improvements, there is a content offer that has never been so rich and complex, but in large part a little too anchored to the past. In short, FIFA is heading towards excellence again without fully achieving it: it begins to transform its beating heart, but not its own head. And for a champion to become a champion, it is necessary to have both.",,,,,,"A refreshingly realistic take on the game of football and tons of content should be enough for fans to dive once again in the virtual stadiums of FIFA. However, Ultimate Team remains the gaming industry's most aggressively toxic loot box environment. Also, that precious next-gen feeling will have to wait.","There are a number of welcome changes in FIFA 22. The gameplay is more rewarding and the animations are finally interesting. There’s more intricacy to build-up play and often a much more satisfying finish. But there’s also no getting around the large number of bugs, the fairly modest improvements in various game modes and the continued focus on paying to win in FUT. FIFA 22 is certainly more Europa Conference League than Champions League.","FIFA 22 is a fundamentally better experience than the one we've had in the past four years, but it is still a fundamentally flawed experience. The HyperMotion system isn't always competent, but the new ball physics, as well as a slower gameplay, make this entry much worthier of the ""simulation"" label.",,,"Microtransactions still loom large, but small iterative changes and the horsepower of new-gen consoles combine to make FIFA 22 feel like a worthwhile upgrade without needing anything revolutionary or terribly exciting from EA’s side.",,,,,,,"Unlike last years release, there aren't too many noticable issues that need improving on either. EA have been afforded more time to get this game to where they need it to be, and they seem to have done exactly that. On the other hand though, there are still modes with untapped potential that EA have to put more focus on in order to appeal to their full market of players. It's a strong release from EA, one which will keep them at the top of the footballing sim market, but without a leading competitor to challenge them, that isn't awfully difficult.",,,,,,,"FIFA 22 could be a new beginning for the series thanks to a better football sensation. The gameplay is smooth, slower and fun. Sadly, many of its mode still lack that extra edge to feel different from FIFA 21.","FIFA 22 is the most interesting and deep entry in the series from years to date, thanks to its new physics, AI and level of details. FIFA 22 gives players a game finally balanced, where defenders have the same power of attackers. The spectacular and televised identity of the franchise, though, is always the same, but this comes as a silent revolution which, if not muted after a couple of match in the name of metagame and pro gaming, it could be a great start for the future.",,,,,"It is hard to recommend buying FIFA at all this year. Like no other yearly release in the franchise, FIFA 22 is a game of thin margins.","FIFA 22 kicks-off of the football season with a renewed edition, with the much-awaited Hypermotion Technology playing the leading role. The (numerous) new animations shine above all, while the gameplay has a slightly lower pace, with skills playing a lesser role. An interesting choice, that works quite well despite some issues (goalkeepers) that we hope will be fixed as soon as possible. As always, there is a rich choice of game modes, with a range of options able to satisfy both those looking for a quick & simple experience and those looking for a challenge that can last for months... or even until the release of FIFA 23.",,,,,,"FIFA 22 has achieved a successful acceleration with its HyperMotion feature and new dynamics.

Off the pitch, EA still has some work to do, but new additions to Career Mode and match days somewhat make up for Ultimate Team’s egregious tactics.",,,"If you're playing on current-gen systems, FIFA 22 may be a bit of a harder sell. The game itself is largely the same as last year, It's the next-gen graphics and gameplay that really make the game stand out. On next-gen, it's a must for longtime FIFA players. For everyone else, it's more of a personal choice. You certainly won't be missing out on much if you wait a little while.",,,,"FIFA 22 is packed with all the usual modes you’d expect from the yearly iteration, but this time there have been significant improvements to the on-field action.

HyperMotion Technology, and a push for enhanced visuals, physics, and more, make this an incredibly tactical experience and closer to the real thing than ever before. The inevitable problem is when you look at the insidious inclusions off the pitch, such as FUT, which - while somewhat more generous with the in-game currency - is still incredibly predatory and push on the in-game gambling mechanics.","FIFA 22 makes the leap to the new generation in a conservative way, with slight changes in its gameplay that lay the foundations of what the saga may become in the future.

mlb-the-show-22,,"MLB The Show 22 plays too strong of a game on the field and offers too much with Diamond Dynasty, March to October, franchise mode and a general cohesiveness to be a bad sports game. However, some of the missteps are impossible to ignore because of what other sports games offer, and because of what the Show series has offered in the past.",,,,,,,,"Even though The Show 22 provides players with some great gameplay changes and improvements, SDS still offers nothing new to the single-player modes. It still is a great baseball simulation, but the lack of upgrades sadly provides existing players with little reason to transfer to the new iteration, besides this season’s new dynamic content in Diamond Dynasty.",,"Additionally, while improved trade logic was supposed to show up in this year’s game, I was still able to trade for Shohei Ohtani with just a handful of my second-tier players; trades remain a bit too easy to execute in this game (NBA 2K’s sliders are recommended as the fix here). And there are still no custom created draft classes, meaning your Franchise mode eventually winds up with a host of random players if you play it long enough. (I’d love to see historic draft classes in this game)...It all prevents an intriguing game from reaching its ultimate potential. MLB The Show 22 sets a new bar in one category, and every sports game can learn a lesson from it. And it’s fun enough. There’s just more potential to be unlocked, hopefully next year.","MLB The Show 22 stumbles for the first time in recent memory. This is understandable with San Diego Studios' ambitious goal of releasing the game on five platforms if we count the last generation consoles. Nevertheless, The Show 22 is still the best baseball sim you can buy and one I can't put down. From the attention to detail to the number of different game modes you can play through, The Show 22 continues to improve on last year's game, even though it's not to the degree we are used to. If you're a baseball fan, I cannot recommend MLB The Show 22 more.",,,,,"MLB The Show 22 doesn´t need too much to become one of the best sports videogame every year, and maybe this is its biggest problem.

Despite of that, we are talking about an extremely solid game, one more season.",,,"At the end of the day, MLB The Show 22 doesn´t bring much to the table in terms of innovation, but when it comes to gameplay and game modes, that's where it really shines. Fans of the franchise will find a lot to love over here, and newcomers won't have too much trouble learning the game thanks to all the amazing accesibility options. The newest entry in the beloved baseball franchise is basically more of the same, but better.","While MLB The Show 22 is definitely a step up from last year’s game, it’s pretty clear that the years of the franchise setting the bar for other sports games are behind us. That said, the fixes they’ve made after last year’s soulless debacle are enough that I expect I’ll be spending quite a bit of time with this game over the next 12 months or so – which is a pretty big step up from what I was expecting when I started playing it.","There is room for improvement in future patches, but MLB The Show 22 is an enjoyable experience regardless of how it's played or how new a player is to the franchise. There's nothing quite like hearing the crack of the bat on a perfect swing and watching the ball sail out of the park.

If you picked the game up last year, you’re paying for minor tweaks and a roster update, and you might not feel a new game is worth it.","Still surprisingly swing-and-miss online, but for long-lasting and moreish solo play, NBA 2K22 is its only competitor in a two-horse championship duel.","The biggest problem Sony faces is in getting more casual fans to enjoy its baseball games. The hardcore are going to love it, and mechanically, MLB does a great job of giving you ways to fine-tune how you play, the control system that works for you, and so on. This is effortlessly the best baseball game we’ve seen to date. However, what it doesn’t do is make players comfortable with it before throwing them in the deep end. Whether it’s endless statistics and career-altering decision trees in the career mode, the overwhelming experience of having cards and items and microtransactions thrown at you in that mode, or the need to manage an entire team while also dealing with the on-field performance, MLB The Show 22 is difficult to get into if you’re a casual fan of the sport. A simple season mode would have gone a long way to address that, but, for whatever reason, Sony doesn’t seem overly concerned with making its series the catalyst that converts people with a casual interest in baseball into fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"This may be the best baseball game available right now, but when it’s only incrementally better than least year’s effort, you might not feel like it’s worth the cost.",,,,,,"As other big sport sims, MLB The Show 22 offers a solid proposal, rich on gameplay modes and options that make it approachable by anyone, regardless its age or skill, although the ""pay to win"" component and expensive pack and card prices affect the final impression.","I’m between a rock and a hard place with MLB The Show 22. On the one hand, I still think Sony San Diego delivers the best simulation sports game on the market today. On the other hand, if it weren’t for the new commentary team, I’d feel like I’m playing last year’s game.

Only when the developers choose to genuinely flesh out their most popular modes (and redesign that damn locker room!) will this series get back to where it belongs.",,"Another strong outing, but only a small upgrade from MLB The Show 21.","MLB The Show 22 is much more a series of adjustments and small evolutions compared to its predecessor than a completely new title, which, despite looking like a mere roster update, allows it to keep delivering one of the best sports simulators on the market.",,,,"Spending time playing the different modes, and just getting a general feel for MLB The Show 22, I found myself enjoying more of the game than I thought I would. Homerun Derby among the other game modes really helped to engulf and immerse myself in the game. Between stats and rosters it is always fun to mess around with major league rosters the way you would want real teams to manage their rosters. With what should be a lasting impression MLB The Show 22 leaves little to the imagination from its predecessor. What should be a definitive installment with the addition of online co-op, winds up being more of the same formula that needs some updates and changes if it is to have a lasting legacy.","MLB The Show 22 is still among the highest forms of video game baseball available … right along with the game that came before it. It still plays exquisitely, and it's still definitely worth your time if you've never really experienced the series before.

But while this is undoubtedly a streamlined, enhanced version of the already excellent MLB The Show 21, casual players will struggle to spot the difference – and, frankly, some aspects of the series are really beginning to tire.",,,,,"While the 2021 edition had more than conquered us, the 2022 season of MLB The Show is still a success... but will not bring as much interest. Perfect gateway to baseball games for anyone who loves the sport and knows its rules, the Sony IE title will not make a regular in the saga jump out of his chair, and that's the only big downside: the lack of new game modes. For the rest, the modeling of the greatest bat and ball stars is impeccable, the lifespan striking with a gameplay always accessible to newcomers. But be careful, you still have to know the sport.",,"There’s something to be said about not messing with something that’s working just fine. The Show 22 is a familiar product for better and for worse. The ball game is as solid as ever, but the video game entry fails to offer something truly new for PlayStation owners who bought last year’s installment, while its most noticeable change doesn’t really help matters.","Why would you want to buy MLB The Show 22? If I’m being completely honest, it’s really hard to justify taking the plunge this year, especially if you owned 2021’s installment. This release feels devoid of any marque justification for purchase, aside from continued refinement on existing mechanics. It’s really hard to shake the feeling that this was supposed to be a grand slam and ended up being a dribbler off the end of the bat.","MLB The Show 22 is a solid entry in the long-running baseball franchise. This year’s approach caters to its fanbase by improving upon what it’s good at while helping new players discover the magic of baseball. Despite encouraging players to spend more than in years past, Diamond Dynasty is still a game excellent mode that is a real highlight for the baseball sim that provides an unbelievable amount of replayability.",,,"MLB The Show 22 is still a great game of ball, but one that is stating to slow down as it ages.

But the short-term successes I’ve already had make it enticing to see that season through to the end. I am sure that repeated commentary, rote animations, and inexplicable simulation results will nag at me come September. I’m also sure that I will still be playing this game in October.","MLB The Show 22 continues the tradition of being an excellent emulation of the sport of baseball, but this is another year without major changes. The team seems to be playing it safe and while there will be new players that are blown away, PlayStation players continue to clamor for something refreshing. The cooperative play is fun and it works well, but a portion of this requires going down the rabbit hole that is Diamond Dynasty. It’s the look and the feel of what’s on the field with the updated presentation and the new announcing team that helps to bring some light to the series.

Hitting, pitching, and fielding remain sublime, and another year on the newest generation of hardware has virtual ballplayers looking even better.

The push-pull between reliable small refinements and incomplete major additions is evident, and it’s the clearest sign of the limitations an annual release can have on the series so far. MLB The Show 22 remains a very good baseball game, but it’s beginning to look like a star ballplayer on their way toward a post-prime decline.","MLB The Show 22 is a slight improvement over the last year's edition with a couple of novelties that fans will know how to appreciate, but it still leaves a lot of room for future adjustments, especially when it comes to the new online co-op mode.",,,,,"MLB The Show 22 is a fantastic baseball simulator that fans of the sport will enjoy.

It is fun, full of options and with a gameplay studied to meet everyone's needs without distorting the essence of baseball. At the same time, it is also almost identical to its predecessor, with only some minor changes and adds-on that are not too surprising. For this reason, if for those who want to pitch, hit and run for the first time it is an unmissable event, the same cannot be said for the veterans of the series.

This is Need for Speed, so you know what you’re here for - fast races, cop chases, and more cars than you know what to do with. Unbound is all of that packaged in the series’ most stylish entry to date.","Need for Speed Unbound is a great showcase for a new generation of hardware. Criterion has delivered a high quality, breathtakingly fast open-world street racer that is both technically superb and strangely familiar.",,"While Criterion has successfully returned to the genre, it feels like the developer is being held back from delivering a truly colorful and over-the-top experience it's previously achieved in games like the Burnout series.

The near-mandatory police chases quickly become a nuisance and we wouldn't mind if those didn't make a return.","Need for Speed Unbound does not reinvent the wheel, but it does tune it. Criterion Games wanted to stand out with its new artistic style and has succeeded. We are not facing the best driving game of the year, but we do see an NFS that wants the saga to return to the highest categories. Fun, fast and furious.","I can live with many of Need For Speed Unbound’s faults. Admittedly, there were fleeting moments when I enjoyed the routine of earning cash, upgrading, outrunning police, and climbing Lakeshore’s underground racing ranks. But, when a Need For Speed game spits in the face of people that use wheel and pedal setups, it’s tough to feel a need for anything other than a need to play a better game.

The only gripe is an incredibly slow progression system.","Need for Speed Unbound is a fun racer with a comic book look that challenges and motivates, but exaggerates a bit when it comes to police and story.","Need for Speed Unbound is a fun racer with some new event types and an unusual yet undeniably attractive visual style. However, it doesn't do a ton to set itself apart from other racers that are currently out there and its story mode can be quite limiting.","Need for Speed Unbound could have been one of the best entries in the legendary series. It has great visuals, an good soundtrack and a lot of collectibles, but fails to deliver a better racing experience. The progression system is a mess and there are more police chases than actual races.",,"At the end of the day, Unbound is one of the best racing games this year, and the return of Criterion has proved to be the winning card for EA. It’s a fun game to play, there’s no doubt about it, and proper support for new-gen consoles means it could stay around for quite a long time.",,,"Need for Speed Unbound can be called one of the better games in the franchise thanks to its fine gameplay and fun races. At the same time, we can't ignore the fact that the police feels unbalanced and the game suffers from a lot of pop-in. Also, the balance between cars is not good and the checkpoints are awkwardly placed in certain races. Every positive point also has a negative counterpart, which ultimately makes it nothing more than a mediocre racer.",,"Despite one or two small complaints, Need for Speed Unbound is a great arcade racer, finally getting the series back on track. The versatile handling feels fantastic, and the single-player offers a highly engaging campaign, pitting you against the cops and other racers in equal measure. The much talked-about cartoon effects succeed in bringing some flair to the experience, and it all runs wonderfully at 4K and 60 frames-per-second. If you can forgive a slightly underwhelming backdrop and a barebones online mode, the minute-to-minute action make this more than worth taking for a spin.","Need for Speed Unbound is a visually appealing game accessible to anyone. Hardcore fans are going to enjoy it a lot, and casual fans too. Thanks to this great work, Criterion has the window open to present new ideas like the one we saw in Unbound.","Need for Speed was seriously starting to look dead and buried – and here comes the rescue party!

Gameplay-wise, it’s a safe approach that sticks to what has always worked for NFS, with police playing a big part during races and open-world exploration. Thankfully, the visual shift does a lot to make this racer feel fresh, taking it in a different direction from the likes of Forza and Gran Turismo. Those looking for an arcade racer with some attitude should check out Unbound, as it wins far more than it loses, and looks great doing it.","Like a friend that refuses to grow up, Need for Speed: Unbound brings the franchise back with all of its inherent silliness and ill-advised driving. And, just like that friend, I wouldn’t have it any other way. Its story is forgettable, and its characters are more than a little irritating, but it’s a solid arcade racer that hopefully acts as a springboard for the franchise.",,,,,,"Terrifically fast, well-balanced street racing that really makes the most of PS5.

Electronic Arts reorganized its action-racing development in response. Unbound arrives with the same lack of glamour, the same diminished cachet, but it is so much more fun, and so much more worth my time racing and running from the law, that the game feels like racing’s comeback player of the year. [Polygon Recommends]","Need for Speed Unbound brings plenty of style and builds upon the high stakes dynamic established in 2019’s Heat to create an engaging and enjoyable open world racing game. The large emphasis on story falls flat once again particularly during the slow opening hours, and the online mode lacks some of the best aspects of the single player mode, including police and Takeover events. Fortunately, the excellent performance and smart overhaul to the turbo system ensures the moment-to-moment gameplay always feels great, and the huge amount of unlockable vehicles, customization options and optional activities and collectibles means there’s always plenty to do each time you make the trip to Lakeshore City.","Need for Speed Unbound is a refreshing entry in the franchise, with new visual effects that enhance its sense of style. But for all the good that it does, it commits the cardinal racing game sin by periodically forcing the player to slow down, resulting in a fun, but mixed gameplay experience.","Definitely a step in the right direction for the series, with really good ideas, that can become repetitive in the long run.",,"Need for Speed Unbound is the best arcade racer of 2022, and a real statement from EA and Criterion. Why it’s snuck out with so little fanfare will be one of the mysteries of the year.","Need for Speed Unbound is a game that favors glamor and style over substance. It’s an absolute visual and aural treat. Don’t get me wrong, the art direction is phenomenal, especially with the combination of unique cel-shaded effects and photo-realistic graphics. I mean, they even got A$AP Rocky to feature. I keep wanting to push the pedal to the metal and thoroughly enjoy what the game has to offer, but the endless bloat and grind to get there is beyond disheartening and frustrating. Criterion has promised free content updates in the future, so here’s to hoping it satisfies the needs of the Need for Speed community. But what Unbound has to offer at this moment is a high price tag, a cliche narrative, and an average racing experience.",,,"Need for Speed Unbound feels like a breath of fresh air. The arcade-style racing has seen quite a significant improvement from its predecessor, and the game’s general styles and sensibilities definitely make it one of the most unique-looking racing games out there.",,"Need for Speed Unbound delivers a controversial ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" style, with cel-shaded characters within a realistically rendered world, but gameplay-wise the beautiful open world of Lakeshore City is somewhat not much interesting to explore.","It's ironic how a product called ""Unbound"" is, in contrast, still so harnessed by the canons of traditional open world racing games, resulting all too similar to its direct predecessor. Need For Speed Unbound is a solid title overall , provided, however, that you approach it without too many pretensions. Net of some structural problems that can make you turn up your nose, the game manages to entertain, thanks to a deep customization of the vehicles and a multiplayer that works properly. The original sin, however, lies in the wanting to insist on a slightly lazy playful formula. production that unfortunately does not deviate from the trend that starts from Burnout Paradise and links all the Need For Speed released in the last decade, son of a repeated life a little indolent. There is therefore a need for Electronic Arts to get back on track and engage the turbo as soon as possible, if it wants to return to excel in the panorama of arcade driving games.",,,,,,,,"For every well done aspect of Need for Speed Unbound, there are two or three that leave something to be desired. The narrative doesn't have to be the main focus, but it's lazily done, via offscreen dialogue that takes place while you're in the menu. The new Takeover events don't deliver the fun they promise, and the police chases leave much to be desired, but the core gameplay, along with the soundtrack and vehicle customisation, is so good that there are moments when you forget all about it. At 300km/h, it all gets a bit blurry, doesn't it?",,,,"As a standalone title, or if it's your first NFS, it's not bad, but it's not the kick-start the series needed.

Beyond its art style that stands tall on its own, Need for Speed Unbound feels less like an innovation and more like a new body kit installed on an old engine. When the competition is already miles ahead, what this series needed was a nitrous boost of epic proportions, but sadly, it doesn’t seem like it will ever catch up.",,"Need For Speed Unbound is easily one of the best racers I’ve played in recent years and a modern highlight of the series. Through great gameplay, a true sense of progression, an engaging visual style, and a well-crafted open world the game manages to cement itself as one of 2022’s most unexpectedly shining stars. A few knocks for cliché story beats, a samey soundtrack, and a few minor bugs shouldn’t be enough to keep players from driving over to the streets to Lakeshore for some stylish, speedy fun.",,"With Unbound, Criterion take a big step in the right direction and delivers gripping action races paired with exciting police chases.","The latest title in the NFS franchise came back with fresh visuals.

It's an astonishing, action-packed ninja adventure that should not be missed out on.",,"With its interesting story, mechanics that are easy to pick up but difficult to master, and its overall fun factor, Cyber Shadow is a retro platformer that is easy to recommend.",,,,,,,,,,"Shovel Knight was an example of an indie platformer that did hold up its end of the deal on both ends and that comparison doesn’t work in Cyber Shadow’s favor. Its boss fights and soundtrack can compete with other modern indie greats, but the rest of its gameplay inherits many of the antiquated parts that have been stripped out in other thoughtful throwbacks. This dichotomy makes Cyber Shadow a lot like its protagonist as it is made up of parts both old and new. But unlike Shadow, Cyber Shadow is made up of obsolete pieces, resulting in a rusty, defective cyber ninja that’s stuck in the wrong time period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A love letter to the NES era of platformers, Cyber Shadow scratches the retro itch just right. With some amazing gameplay elements and a killer presentation, this is an adventure you need in your life right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cyber Shadow isn't afraid to just be what it is: an unapologetic, retro-inspired action game. Steady upgrades mean you'll be introduced to new mechanics for most of the adventure, keeping things interesting all the way. An old-school challenge awaits, and while it's mostly a fair fight, checkpoints can be a little far apart, and some bosses might stop you in your tracks. Still, if you're looking for a rock solid side-scroller, this is absolutely worth your time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cyber Shadow doesn’t do much that’s surprising, and can sometimes be too tough for its own good. However, those with plenty of patience and an appetite for pain will find fun in this modern throwback. Just be aware that the price of admission may be your sanity, and that’s a high price to pay for this competent-but-flawed war of attrition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cyber Shadow is a great modern take on the retro games that inspired it. Jumping and slashing your way through each of its areas is a lot of fun, and its checkpoint system smartly eliminates potential frustration and repetition. Even though some aspects could be better, Cyber Shadow is still a very enjoyable adventure and a strong debut for Mechanical Head Games.",,"For anyone looking for a challenge, Cyber Shadow is going to make their day. This would have fit in like a glove with the old NES library, next to Ninja Gaiden, Contra, and Castlevania. Those who remember those days and remember nearly getting an aneurism over how crushingly difficult those old games were, maybe sit this one out.",,"Cyber Shadow is a solid retro throwback with a few things that drag it down. The feeling of becoming more powerful and being able to take down huge enemy threats with your wits and skills is very rewarding, and the levels when you can use your abilities more freely to overcome challenges are quite fun. It's the trial-and-error areas littered with cheap deaths, demanding exact precision over long and frustrating stretches, that hamper the experience. Still, if you're looking for an old-school-styled ninja game that will test your skills (and sometimes your patience), Cyber Shadow is a worthy contender.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
observer-system-redux,,,,,,,,Observer: System Redux creates a miserable vision of the future that will appeal to sci-fi and horror fans. The game is essentially just an evolved point and clicker but it sucks you in and at the very least does a good job of showing off some clever PS5 tech.,,,,,"A fantastic world brought to life by great storytelling, world-building, and visual and audio design. Though I wish the voices and dialogue could have gotten some extra work put into it, overall Observer: System Redux is Bloober Team's best game yet. The Ray Tracing breaths life to a dusty and decrepit building while the DualSense allows you to feel the various actions Lazarski performs. Observer: System Redux is a great example of what both Ray Tracing and the innovations of the DualSense controller are capable of.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alongside the visual upgrades, improved gameplay mechanics and the somewhat budget price they are. Observer was a great game, and Observer: System Redux sees it further improved in every area. It’s just a shame that the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions haven’t been created equally. Still, if you’re after a comparably inexpensive game to show off what your next-gen console can do, it’s well worth picking up, especially on PS5 where it particularly shines thanks to its DualSense implementation. Though be warned: it’s not for the faint of heart.",,,,,,,"Observer is a decent game. The highly detailed environments and disturbing dream sections are hobbled only by the gameplay’s limited, repetitive nature during the real world sections. It features a solid voice work performance from Rutger Hauer too. As an early title for the PS5, there is much to be impressed with. Observer runs smooth and loads quickly, and it looks great even though the artistic direction subdues the impact. However, the old dictum remains – good graphics alone do not make for a great game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Observer System Redux is a better game than the original and manages to convey the thought-provoking story in a more structured fashion, with added details. It does not offer just a graphical upgrade but also manages to better portray the surrounding moral and physical decay, improving the atmosphere and the overall experience. The bugs are annoying, but can easily be fixed. Those who did not try the game yet, should go ahead and dive into this adventure, they will not regret it. Thanks to the added extra content, Observer System Redux can be also recommended to those who already unveiled Dan’s story. Still, it feels that it would have been more appropriate to offer System Redux as a free upgrade to those who already own the game, instead of charging extra money for it.",,,,,"Observer: System Redux is a legitimately impressive overhaul. At long last, the PS5 has allowed Bloober Team’s ambitions with this title to be properly realized. New quests slot into the experience wonderfully, Rutger Hauer’s performance remains impeccable, and the game just generally has a lot more to offer this time out. While an overreliance on jump scares and a plot desperately in need of some trimming hold the experience back from true greatness, Observer’s fancy new PS5 incarnation at long last feels like the title it was originally intended to be.",,,,,,,,"Observer: System Redux is not for everyone. Hell, it wasn’t for me. But the experience itself, where it takes you at least, is worth the ride. It’s worth the sweaty palms and the dread of turning on your new console, knowing full well the tense and often uncomfortable adventure through madness that awaits. Some may even decide that it’s worth a second go-round.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, Observer: System Redux is a great pickup for those looking to see just exactly how well their shiny new consoles can perform, as well as having an interesting experience to boot (you know, like a computer). Environments are beautiful in a truly depressing, atmospheric manner, and lead Rutger Hauer really makes the effort to portray a downtrodden detective tired of the new cybernetic world order. This is a clear pick up for fans of psychological horror drama, looking for a few jump scares and… uncomfortable-ness over a few hours. For the rest, however, it's an interesting experiment that perhaps could benefitted from less of the shocks and more of the Detective chops.","Observer System Redux represents a solid and visible improvement over the original: therefore, a worthwhile upgrade.","Observer therefore remains a horror-tinged investigative thriller that absolutely deserves to be experienced and, thanks to the next gen, also “felt” on your skin.",,,,,,,,,,,"Blade Runner meets 1984 in Observer: System Redux, a tense and atmospheric psychological horror murder mystery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Observer: System Redux weaves a moving story, both fascinating and relatable. With fantastic updated graphics, stunning audio, moving voice acting, and a memorable environment, this is a tale worth experiencing. I just wish it actually played better. The few times you actually have to do more than walk from room to room, the game falls apart. Thankfully they don’t make up a huge chunk of Observer, but they grow more common as you get deeper into the game. If you’re okay with that, though, and have time for an interesting cyberpunk story, Observer is worth your time.",,"When Observer was originally released three years ago, it was mostly met with praise, even though the console version left a lot to be desired. But with the power of Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X, this psychological horror crime adventure corrects many of the errors from the first version – and adds greatly improved graphics and some new content. The gameplay is still limited, and the bugs are unfortunately a bit too frequent, but the world and story keeps us hooked to the end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Released as both a remaster and an expansion, Observer: System Redux manages to fully deliver its promises, improving the original's experience with new meaningful content, quality of life changes, and massive visual improvements that leverage the power of the new consoles. The game hasn't changed a whole lot since the original, so those who did not like it in the first place will not change their minds with Observer: System Redux, but those that did will find the remaster to be a worthy purchase.",,,"A compelling game given new dimension. New wrinkles in the tale justify revisiting, but the more abrasive parts of its personality are wearing thin three years on.

grid-legends,,,"Grid Legends is a distinguished racing game, specially by its story in the ""documentary"" style - one of the best I've seen in games of the genre - despite being cliché and leaving the player in the background. This is a great racing game. It's a shame it was ""squeezed"" into a season with many equally excellent games vying for attention. Going head to head against Forza Horizon 5 and Gran Turismo 7 isn't easy, but Grid Legends brings its own identity and shows that the genre has much more to offer.",,"Playing through Grid Legends’ story mode was a treat — at times I felt like I was a part of a real team with drama and stakes. I would have liked to see it expanded, but the driving is really what players are here for, and in that regard, Grid Legends is a real winner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Grid Legends finds its niche alongside Forza Horizon and Gran Turismo, offering track-based thrills for all skill levels.",,"GRID Legends is a lot of fun overall. Its story mode is enjoyable pulp drama while the minute-to-minute racing is genuinely exhilarating. It may feel a little limited overall for those who want a deep racing experience, but players who go in expecting something breezy will find plenty to love here.",,,,"Grid Legends has a good driving model, but its career mode annoyed me with some awful design choices. The story mode is decent, but it’s narrative is so obvious, you instantly know how the thing ends. In terms of graphics, great weather effects contrast with some aged textures, while the game as a whole suffers from heavy recycling.",,,,,"GRID Legends stands out from the pack thanks to great variety, action packed racing, fallible rivals and a superbly endearing story mode.",,,"With GRID Legends, Codemasters has delivered one of the most generous and inclusive racing games of recent years. Though while its moment-to-moment action is pretty much second to none, its career mode just doesn’t quite get its hooks in you like it should. Throw in limited multiplayer offerings, and you have a racing game that’s great but not spectacular. If you want to fling cars around a whole load of city-based tracks and gleefully trade paint with your competitors, this is the racing game for you. Just don’t go in expecting to get all that invested in your career exploits.","The Driven to Glory campaign is the big push, but is actually only a thin layer of what this package offers overall. GRID Legends has a solid career mode, with a ton of cool activities and customization options. The content gating is a bit frustrating (be prepared to grind a bit), but overall there is a mountain of fun to be had with this rock-solid arcade racer.",,"GRID Legends is a wonderful racer that dials down the simulation elements of other racers, making it accessible to everyone. It features a fair amount of modes and some stunning visuals, as well as a wide range of cars to choose from.",,"A decent new entry to the revamped GRID series, which keeps the middle between pure arcade and sim racing. Races are no-nonsense across diverse tracks. While not without technical issues, the races itself are generally enjoyable and graphically above adequate. Progress is regularly gated, which could have easily been dropped, as there is more than enough content available. An even larger range of tracks would have been great.","Codemasters delivers another great racing game. GRID Legends includes a new story mode and nemesis system, perfect controls and a wide variety of competitions, up to 22 players online. We loved climate effects such as rain or snow.","A tip of the hat to Codemasters for trying something new with the Story Mode. While it doesn’t enhance the game in the way intended, it does make for a useful tour of the game’s offerings. Grid Legends is a lot of fun and that’s what really matters at the finish line.","Grid Legends has been a little prey to their intentions and times. The first, because what they wanted to reinforce the most is a narrative story mode that is far below what we expected to stay in no man's land. It is neither surprising, nor particularly interesting and does not seem to take itself too seriously. On the other hand, it doesn't invent the wheel either, never better said. And it dares to come out just a few days before a giant of virtual driving such as Gran Turismo 7.",,,,,,,,"Collisions! Drama! Firework! And in between also some races in which your car rarely steers really well. That summary does indicate that Grid Legends is not for real motorsport enthusiasts, but can be fun for the more casual racing fan.",,,,,,"If you are a GRID fan and want to have lots of fun with the newest entry of the series, GRID Legends is a nice addition to your library. But if you are looking for a more realistic approach instead of an arcade one, maybe you should probably look elsewhere.",,"GRID Legends is without a doubt an evolution of the 2019 installment, even though hardcore fans of the franchise expected a bigger upgrade. The overhaul is not very obvious at first, and this is why I think you should give it some time. Try the story mode, even if it’s quite short, and pay attention to the smallest details. This is what GRID Legends is all about. It’s a more refined version of its 2019 sibling, and in many ways, it feels the racing experience even more involving. But at the end of the day, it’s essential to always know what to expect. GRID Legends isn’t by any means supposed to be a racing sim. It’s still an arcade title, and as long as you have this mind, there’s absolutely no chance you’ll end up disappointed.",,,"A new racer in the well-known franchise that doesn't really excel at anything, but certainly doesn't do anything wrong either. It is entertaining, varied and has enough content to keep you interested for a long time. It also looks and plays nice. It is notable that it is on the easy side and that there are some flaws here and there. Fan of arcade racers? Then this is a good choice.",,"GRID Legends is a solid new entry in Codemasters’ racing franchise. It features the same excellent gameplay you’ve come to expect from the developer, with some nice adaptive trigger implementation in the PS5’s DualSense. The game’s main draw — the Story Mode — falls short of providing a compelling narrative, ultimately amounting to a mere distracting backdrop to the true star of the show: the races. Visuals look nice, but perhaps not nice enough for the PS5, and the music is overall a bit repetitive and unnecessary. All in all though, GRID Legends is worth a look, but time will tell if it manages to hold its own against the competition.",,"Grid Legends is a unique racing game because it actually manages to tell a compelling story. All the rivalries and friendships manifest themselves on the racetrack. The racing itself is quite easy, however, and will not challenge anyone except the beginners.",,"Although its addition of plot and characters doesn’t quite work the racing action is as thrilling as ever, with a huge diversity of vehicles and the compelling handling fans have come to expect from the series.","Much like the previous title released in 2019, GRID Legends will not revolutionize the history of racing games, but it is still very good arcade entertainment. If it does not go far enough in the depth of its career mode and in the possibilities of customizing the liveries, the title is on the other hand very complete on its most raw aspect.",,,,,,,,,,"Providing a good time for both sim fans and arcade racing fiends, Grid Legends has plenty of content and knows how to use it. Get in and enjoy the ride. [Issue#12, p.76]",,,,,,,,"Codemasters has put a good amount of thought into reinventing the GRID experience. GRID Legends is no doubt the best GRID to date with the amount of new options and the power of the PlayStation 5 and added tech included. I simply had a lot of fun playing this as the racing model is as addictive as ever. The story mode deserves recognition due to its design and a solid enough story, but feels more like a tutorial to get players acclimated with the series. The visuals have highlights and lowlights, but the weather effects and the reflections are where it shines the best without having to implement ray tracing. The game needs to be experienced with a headset on this console and it also gives a possible idea of what a game that launches in a week might have in store. GRID Legends pushes the series forward with new additions while the core game remains intact.",,"This is a solid evolution from the previous entry, with a fun career mode and, what’s more important, plenty of virtues for racing fan games to enjoy.",,"GRID Legends builds on the foundations of the 2019 reboot, improving the driving experience in certain areas, adding a big new story mode, and throwing more variables and variety into the mix. There's enjoyable, pulpy action racing to be had here, but some of the fundamental weaknesses from the last game remain, and as the racing game community increasingly looks toward sim racing, it feels like this franchise is in need of another reinvention.",,,,"GRID Legends might not blow your doors off, but it does tighten many of the core ideas from previous games while packing in a ton of content.","GRID Legends does an admirable job of keeping pace with its rivals with a steady title offering all a racing fan would expect. Every aspect is done to an admirable standard from graphics, modes and handling. This is recommended for fans of the genre but also for newcomers looking for an arcade feel mixed with their realism. With the excellently cheese fest of story mode and fun integration of the nemesis system, there's something for everyone here.",,,,,,,,,,"Grid Legends could have been left behind, having launched at same time as another fairly big name of virtual motorsports. However, Codemasters gave us one of the best simcade experiences ever. With an impressive Story Mode, the usual variety in events and classes, and an acessible Race Editor, Grid Legends honors its TOCA origins and places itself right back on the main... grid.",,,,"GRID Legends is a hell of a fun arcade ride with a serious pedigree that continues the evolution started in the reboot from 2019. However, the FMV story mode is something we could easily do without.",,,,,,,"GRID Legends is a mismatched racing game with a surprising story mode and features. The gameplay is an awkward mix of simulator and arcade that doesn’t lend itself to either’s strengths, and with puzzling direction will likely alienate fans of both. Yet, Driven to Glory and the sensational crashes in races make for good fun. With Codemasters’ car expertise and implementation of hardware accessories, the experience is worth trying. Still, coming up against other big-name racing series, I don’t think GRID Legends will make the podium finish.",,,,"Grid Legends is designed for experienced fans as well as beginners, offering the enjoyment needed to be successful in this franchise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It doesn't reinvent the wheel by any stretch, but there's no denying that on the track GRID Legends is a fun time.",,,,,,,"While the story is harmless, it’s hard to take it seriously. Thankfully the on-track action is thrilling and varied, offering a robust online setup and everything you’d want from a new Grid game, even if some of the smaller details fall a little flat.",,,,,,,,"Ultimately, Grid Legends is a good pick-up-and-play experience, and folks motivated to grind through every challenge it has to offer will remain occupied for a while. That said, those with less patience for repetitiveness may be looking for the off-ramp sooner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Like the original, GRID Legends aims to not only offer many kinds of racing, but do them at a fairly high level. That is a lofty goal, but one that is largely achieved albeit with a few odd sacrifices. The exciting on-track action is undercut by only the story mode having a bumping soundtrack, and that’s just a bizarre move that I don’t recall saying in a modern-day racer. Franchise fatigue is a real thing and the GRID reboot was hurt by being a series of races with no framework, while everything in GRID Legends has a sense of purpose to it that helps keep a “one more race” mentality throughout each play session. It’s an outstanding racing game and one that fans of the genre should pick up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A short, sweet, and simple adventure that marries contemplative exploration, with uniquely satisfying movement mechanics that function in both a visually stunning open world and the setpiece boss encounters. While the experience may be too easy for some, this game is worthy of attention in the crowded launch line up. Not only as a great title, but a shining example of what indie developers can bring to next generation gaming.",,,,,"A subtle, immersive upgrade to an already brilliant game. The Dualsense really shines in making your traversal and combat feel more alive. The game runs brilliantly, looks beautiful, and has a great score to match. You cannot go far wrong with The Pathless, no matter what version you play.",,,,,,,,The Pathless is a beautiful and epic adventure from the people behind Abzu. A must-have for every indie lover.,"It’s one of those games where the journey matters at least as much as, if not more than, the destination — and, thankfully, it makes that journey as smooth and seamless and pleasant as possible.","While it's not without its flaws, The Pathless is still more fun than it is not, with impressive visuals, fun boss fights, relaxing puzzles, and an interesting movement system. It's one of the better PS5 launch games, and it's easy to see how a sequel could elevate the concept to the next level and become something special.","The Pathless is a wonderful balance between puzzles and boss battles contained in a giant landscape. The gameplay design, specifically the boss level design, demonstrates the possibilities this new generation of consoles might offer.",,,,,,,"Giant Squid's The Pathless minimalist approach has many highs and lows, yet despite its flaws it manages to emerge as a solid game.

I say ""pile"" endearingly, as it's short enough to justify playing right away without becoming backlog fodder.","I’m fully prepared to see the entirety of gaming journalism as a whole take the opposite opinion of The Pathless as the years go by. There’s a giant list of titles that my peers absolutely love, then I play them, and I swear we’ve experienced two different games. That being said, I can see how someone could absolutely love The Pathless, even if it didn’t do anything for me.",,"The Pathless is exceptionally pretty, with great flow and even greater art design. The game loses some of its emotional punch thanks to the open world and the lack of clear pacing, but it's nonetheless a great experience.",,,"Ultimately, The Pathless is somewhat an uneven experience. Its epic boss battles are thrilling, and the majority of its puzzles are enjoyable to solve. It’s just a shame that there’s so much aimless running around between all the fun. Even dashing around at full speed grows tiresome after a while. Providing some sense of direction may go against what The Pathless strives to be, but it would help make your time with the game feel less wasted, and more fulfilling.","The Pathless is a remarkably well-designed game, guiding the player forward with intuitive design while providing plenty of opportunity to experiment and play. With a great locomotion system and an amazing soundtrack, The Pathless will easily see players losing hours while under its hypnotic spell. Fun and rewarding puzzles, a nice story line, and plenty to see and do make The Pathless a great game, regardless of which system you play it on.",,,,"The Pathless is a really entertaining game from the creators of Abzû. The game lets you explore a vast world with a huntress and her eagle. Saving the world is no terrible job since the world is truly amazing, but the lack of enemies and the lack of unlockables don't really invite you to do. Where everything in the game is balanced really good from the puzzles to the boss fights, you get the feeling something is missing eventually. The game is great but could be much, much more than this.",,"The Pathless is a great game. It’s beyond stunning, with a remarkable soundtrack and phenomenal sense of place. Refined traversal mechanics do a lot of the heavy lifting, while puzzles and boss battles could use an extra dose of variety. Though the formula gets tired by the end of the tale, The Pathless proudly stands among giants of the genre like Journey.",,,,,,,"Like previous effort ABZÛ before it, The Pathless leans heavily into the gorgeous cell-shaded world, and it does so with gameplay and story that keeps you locked and engaged for the entirety of its 10 hour story run. Comparisons to games like Shadow of the Colossus and Journey are apt, but seeing the world rush by at 4K and 60fps is a thing of beauty. Come for the frenetic gameplay, stay for the art.",,"The Pathless is not the most original game and actually has too little to do.

Whether the joy you take from it is in its unique and super-slick traversal mechanics, or the arresting world and faultless artistry, there's no denying that Giant Squid has absolutely nailed it.

Solving archery puzzles spread across a wide barren environment just wasn’t for me.","The Pathless is an incredible experience, and easily one of the best launch titles available on the PS5 in what is already an excellent selection. A wondrous, beautiful open world with innumerable locations and secrets to uncover is placed alongside a moving narrative further heightened by an unexpectedly tender relationship between player and bird.

The Pathless excels on all fronts.",,"The Pathless has its issues, but it certainly offers unobtrusive, relaxing fun. What’s unique about it are the movement options. The boss fights and puzzles? Significantly less so.","The Pathless could have been more than it currently is. With more variation in the gameplay and a deeper story, this could just have been GOTY material or at least the indie hit of the year.

It delivers engaging gameplay, as well as frankly beautiful visuals. The issue is that feeling of familiarity *cough*Zelda*cough* coupled with a lack of activities to indulge in. Too often does this feel like a template of greater things to come, and it's a massive hope that this will spawn a sequel. So many great ideas needing to be expanded upon, mainly the excellent movement, as no game this year has given a greater feeling of speed in its unique traversal system, and along with the excellent boss battles, this comes recommended. Here's to The Pathless 2: Less Travelled.",A simple and elegant game; a fascinating experience.,"In short, Giant Squid succeeds in the most difficult task, that of starting from the groove left by the greats, but in the end to trace a new trajectory, leaving a profound and unforgettable mark on the panorama of independent development, and beyond.","The Pathless suffers a way too linear narrative and game structure, but has an inspired art direction, more game features than Abzu, a great work and a great way to tell the players more about it.",,,,,,,,"I hope it isn’t lost amongst the PS5’s bigger, noisier releases, as it’s something different and uplifting.

The graphics and movement are especially brilliant, and the exploration always felt rewarding, even at its repetitive moments. While the writing is nothing to write home about, the connection between the player and the eagle companion keeps the story grounded emotionally.",,"The Pathless is not a big game and doesn't want to gamble too much, but knows which aspects to really bet on. The heart of the game experience is exploration and does a good job of making you fully enjoy the rides and flights over its small but fascinating world.",,The Pathless is a wonderfully different game that makes you feel like you have ownership over the entire experience and are not being led along by a pre-scripted playbook.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Pathless is beautiful but repetitive. There is a somber emptiness to its world that tries to convey a sense of loss and impending doom, but it can also make the proceedings tiring if you don’t regularly redirect yourself toward the things you need to find and fix. It makes bold strides in exploration and world-building, but movement can feel awkward or overly simplistic, and the ruins you seek out house little more than a puzzle and some foggy memories. On a positive note, load times are wonderfully brief on PlayStation 5, and the controller pulses differently for each type of target you fire at. Navigating this world can be both a calming and thrilling experience, there’s just not enough to find to make the journey more than a pleasant trip through the trees.","The Pathless is a visual stunner that lets you explore its gorgeous world via an innovative and fun traversal mechanic. It may be modest in scale, but the platformer leaves a big impact courtesy of smart puzzles and exciting boss battles.",,,"Most of The Pathless plays to its mechanical strengths, free-form exploration, satisfying movement, and methodical puzzle-solving. At times, that lowers the stakes a little too much, but it maximizes the kind of gameplay the game is named for. For a player like me, who bee-lines for an objective every time, it's refreshing to simply take things as they come. The Pathless is the rare game that gives you more by not asking too much, and that makes it special.",,,"Ultimately The Pathless is a very good game, with exceptional art direction and an interesting (if a bit shallow) story. I loved the interactions between The Hunter and her eagle, and found the boss battles to be a high point. The game’s six hour runtime helps to keep the somewhat repetitive gameplay loop from becoming tedious, but it also means it’s more difficult to justify the game’s $40 price tag. I believe that with some expanded lore and a lot more variety in the puzzles on display, Giant Squid could have easily stretched the game out to 10-15 hours. Still, The Pathless is undeniably a great game and a worthy (and unique) addition to the PS5 launch lineup.",,,,,,,,,,,"The Pathless makes a fantastic first impression, with its arresting visuals, fun mechanics, and fascinating dark world. The game’s middle section does start to drift a bit, but it sticks the landing with a great final level and an electrifying and emotionally-satisfying climax.

There are still good times to be had, though, so you may only want to take short excursions on this ship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An interesting take on the roguelike genre that offers a unique and entertaining way to play the game, but feels geared towards co-op over single-player.

souldiers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Souldiers is a kind of comfort food. There are players who will actively seek out a game like this, one that is inspired by the best kinds of interactive nostalgia. While developer Retro Forge is keen on piquing the interest of classic key genres, Souldiers stands surprisingly well on its own qualities. This is a beautiful game that can be absurdly difficult but it’s more than a large, interconnected map and a twist on punishing combat. The name might be a little too clever for its own good but keep in mind that Souldiers is unique in its own right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As it is, Souldiers is a very enjoyable entry in the metroidavania genre – providing you have plenty of skill and/or patience. It doesn’t offer anything that’s genuinely new, but most of its components complement each other well. If only more thought had been given to the player experience, as for many it will simply prove to be too punishing at times. And on PS5, it could do with a little more polish.",,,,,,,"For a game composed of familiar elements, Souldiers still managed to surprise me. If nothing else, the game’s execution is exemplary. Even if you’ve played a ton of pixel art, soulsborne, and Metroidvania titles, this particular blend is a satisfying one. The art direction is beautiful, the controls are tight, and design is rock solid. If you’re looking for a new 2D adventure, Souldiers will easily scratch that itch.",,,"There is a vast supply of quality metroidvanias on the market and Souldiers is yet another game that goes into that pile. However, there are a lot of technical issues and there are no major innovations here.

With an expansive and attractive world, loads of goodies to discover, and intuitive controls, I'm sure you'll enjoy your journey through Terragaya as much as I did.","Despite having beautiful pixel-art visuals, well-crafted maps and challenging mechanics, Souldiers is just another soulslike/Metroidvania that does not bring anything new to the table. It's just a collection of stuff that we've seen before.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Demanding without ever being totally off-putting or daunting, Souldiers is highly recommended for all fans of pixel art metroidvania platform action games. Its deliciously retro artistic direction is far from being the only one of its qualities since the game also knows how to renew itself intelligently by offering no less than 3 radically distinct character classes and gigantic maps full of secrets.",,,,,"Action, platforming and RPG elements melt in this engaging souls-like Metroidvania enriched by a gorgeous pixel-art. You'd better keep it on your radar.",,,,,"A good choice if you enjoy an occasional slice of the retro-styled cake; just be aware that this game bites back. Hard. Stock up on patience, souldier.

However, despite its unbalanced and restrictive class system and frequent difficulty spikes, there is a ton to recommend, from its detailed and varied world, beautiful animations, and engaging combat. Souldiers is not for the faint of heart, but if you’re prepared for its challenges and looking for a deep and engaging metroidvania platformer to get into, Souldiers is worth the recommendation.",,,,"Souldiers is a simply beautiful refined game, quite well made and with all the aspects of a metroidvania. Sometimes the difficulty feels relatively unbalanced, I can tell it's pretty enjoyable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Where you fall on Souldiers probably depends on whether you were an early adopter. Technical issues appearing at launch were considerable, but have now largely been addressed. Those just coming to the game now, or those willing to return for a second attempt, will find a title as superbly high-quality as it is challenging. However, with great challenge comes great satisfaction, and the journey along the way is just so memorable; there were times I could literally not put the controller down, even after hours of playing. The ending does promise a sequel, and I, for one, am extremely excited about what this talented team can provide in a sophomore outing with the lessons learned here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s done serious damage to my productivity over the last few weeks, and for the first time in a long time, I’ve found a massive triple-A game that genuinely prioritizes player enjoyment over anything else.","Yes, the title from Ubisoft is full of qualities, full of energy, full of color and it offers beautiful sensations to seasoned players and others thanks to many options of accessibility. The sense of travel (and speed) and freedom are at the RDV! Too bad that some problems of management of physics and a scenario a little pretext a little spoils the superb panoramas.","The Considering that Riders Republic is not a sports simulation and only aims to offer fun and excitement, and even though there are a lot of problems that cannot be looked over and some of them directly affect the gameplay experience, the final package can still be entertaining while you jump on different vehicles and race around the big, crowded and colorful world of the game.",,"The focus on open-world gameplay was a blessing and a curse for Rider's Republic. It's still a good game, sure - but a little more focus of Ubisoft's side, and it could have become something truly special.","Riders Republic is a masterclass in world design and it is a truly surprising and fun experience for any extreme sports lover.

Its UI isn't the best, and there still seem to be some bugs that need to be ironed out, but there are no issues that really break your fun along the way. On top of the gorgeous presentation, Riders Republic is easy to recommend for anyone with a liking towards a game where they can flip around three times on a pair of rocket ski's mid-air while dressed as a giraffe.",,,,"In terms of gameplay, Riders Republic is an arcade-style racing game. Not necessarily realistic, but very fun, fast and over the top. It's perfect for fans of Tony Hawk, SSX and even (for those slightly older readers) Cool boarders.

Whether you're doing tricks on a snowboard or flying through a ravine in a wingsuit, all the disciplines are incredibly fun.",,,,"Riders Republic is an extremely fun game that will definitely please the fans of this sports. And even as a casual gamer, this title offers plenty of accessibility options that make it a very welcoming experience for newcomers.","Riders Republic definitely does check most of the boxes for what I would like to see in an open world extreme sports title. My only real criticism is that with all the variety of sports, events, equipment and environments, it still starts to feel a bit repetitive after reaching a certain level. The Big/Boss and Sponsor events help to overcome that to an extent and I’m hoping the addition of new sports, fresh live events, and themed seasonal/limited events will as well when they roll out in the future. For now, Riders Republic is a super fun pick up and play multiplayer outdoor sports experience with plenty to see and do right out of the box.",,Riders Republic is a truly massive extreme sports game that borrows from Ubisoft's better open world pillars. A variety of events and the ability to play against massive servers in a gorgeous sandbox provide a unique thrill that few games manage.,"It's not the prettiest game, with distant scenery lacking detail, low-res cinematics, and screen tearing in busy areas. But the dizzying scale of the world, and the complete lack of loading times, is technically impressive. It's also worth noting that you need to be online to experience the career mode and progression—otherwise you're stuck with the freeform, rather empty Zen Mode. Most people play games online these days, but if you can't for whatever reason, your options will be limited. It's frustrating, because the actual riding in Riders Republic is heaps of fun. It's just been packaged in a completely off-putting way.

It's far from perfect, but at least tries to do something different... despite the micropayments.","If you can ignore the game’s obnoxious attitude and in your face corporate sponsorship, you’re richly rewarded with accessible, consistently engaging representations of biking, snow sports, and wing suiting, coupled with a massive and literally awesome environment in which to compete or explore. Those that are into riding the leaderboards–or just playing with their friends–will have plenty of opportunities to fuel their addiction, but I’m guessing that just about everyone can find joy here in just goofing around in this expansive playground, at least for a while. Whether or not Riders Republic sticks the landing and stays in the playlist of many gamers beyond launch probably depends on a steady stream of new sports to try, and if an actual, thriving community pledges allegiance to the Republic’s competitive modes.",,,,,,,"The story is lackluster, the microtransactions are everywhere, but everything else is amazing; it's like being on a rollercoaster ride every single second you play. Ubisoft put its heart and soul into developing every location just so that each race and each moment feels immensely different from the next.

If only you could spend more time racing people instead of bots, then it'd really feel like you're working to become the amazing triathlete Riders Republic wants you to be.",,"Riders Republic, like Steep, is at its best when the game forces you to try harder. Mastering certain challenges takes practice and patience. That's what makes the game. Like Steep, Riders Republic doesn't have a storyline, fancy style, important dialogue, or great music.

That turns out to be enough.","Riders Republic is a step forward in Ubisoft's sporting open worlds, but we're still far from the best that this sport subgenre can really offer.","While it has promise, Riders Republic feels like it needs a bit more time in the oven.

The diverse disciplines makes it variable enough to keep engaged. However, Riders Republic suffers from technical issues.

It's a fun game, but it could've been a lot better on the technical side.",,"Riders Republic tries so hard to be cool that it deserves a roundhouse kick to the mouth, but Ubisoft’s technical chops come out to play here, with an enormous online sandbox stacked to the metaphorical ceiling with high-octane events to complete. This is a game that the French publisher has clearly designed to be built upon, but even day one, with its mix of disciplines and multifaceted Mass Races, it’s an entertaining ride. There are minor niggles for the French publisher to iron out, and we’d recommend muting the dialogue, but don’t bail on this if you have even a passing interest in extreme sports.",,"Not a game without its faults but what it needs to be doing, it does very well - namely the adrenaline-filled, headless ride down the hill.","Riders Republic is the ultimate extreme sports collectible pack. The sense of speed will keep you on the edge of your seat and the varied controls of the different disciplines will challenge you long enough. A footnote is that you should be able to entertain yourself a bit in the graphically beautiful world of Riders Republic, because just like with Steep, the flow of the game is not very obvious. Oh, and give more Mass Races.","Riders Republic is exactly the game it is trying to be, with a modern take on early 2000s xtreme sports games that works in terms of everything except the corporate-mandated ambience.","If Riders Republic may disappoint Steep fans (the title goes against the spirit of the game of 2016), this new production remains a must for all thrill seekers.

If you are willing to overcome a few minor gameplay problems for certain types of activities, which would need some extra filing, and some technical fluctuations, Riders Republic will be able to offer you an unprecedented amount of hours of fun, thank you. also to the intention of the developers to support the product both through paid updates and new completely free content.",,,,,,,,"Riders Republic comes with a lot to give, and one might argue that it may give too much. The Ranking and Item Unlocking systems distract from an experience that, at its core, gives us the best radical sports game since the SSX franchise. Ubisoft presented us with one of the most earnestly fun titles of the year, despite some unfortunately typical choice from the company. The biome diversity and the sheer amount of events, with Mass Races being the standout, culminate in one of the most pleasant gameplays in this genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Even though I liked the racing in Riders Republic, overall, I can't say I enjoyed my time with it.

It’s an inviting world that’s packed with crazy competitors and an addictive series of trials to master.",,,"Focusing on having fun above all else, Riders Republic’s excellent open world, great disciplines and a huge amount of variation will keep you shredding snow and blasting through berms for a long time.",,,,,,,,"Riders Republic makes the best use of Ubisoft’s open-world template. It’s a consistently fun extreme sports game with tons of variety, a wealth of challenges to chase, and excellent social hooks. All of its sporting events are easy to pick up and play, making it perfectly suited for quick drop-ins. Its sense of style is a little out of whack and it doesn’t have the most elegant camera solution, but I’m always eager to fire it up and see how much more it can one-up its zaniness.",,,,,,,"Riders Republic’s posturing is more than a little phony and the game may be a bit mechanically simple for some, but its playground is an impressive one. With travel still difficult, Ubisoft’s sometimes-breathtaking recreation of America’s greatest national parks feels like something to be grateful for, and this game’s wide range of activities and challenges means almost everyone will be able to find some way to amuse themselves amongst its peaks and valleys. Riders Republic is a surprising breath of virtual fresh air.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, Riders Republic is a fantastic game and the most addictive extreme sports game on the market outside of maybe the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 remake. The variety of sports enables the experience to remain fresh, while those wanting a greater challenge can enjoy more events faster by stepping their game up and going for a more all-encompassing experience with more tricks and tougher difficulty. Cross-generation buyers will be in for a far better experience on the PS5 thanks to the SSD speeding things up and making for a much smoother experience, but the PS4 version is impressive given the tech. If it wasn’t for the SSD’s speed, the feeling of both versions’ races would be quite similar and you can’t go wrong with any version.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very exciting stuff! No doubt, I wouldn’t be as enthusiastic about this game if it weren’t for the PS5 DualSense controller. Milestone has gone the extra mile with MotoGP 21, even having an enhancement roadmap you can view on their website. The roadmap clearly outlines improvements planned for May through June. Those updates include adding new bike categories, expanded player controls, and joining in-progress qualifying sessions instead of having to wait as a spectator. While MotoGP 21 is available on all gaming platforms, the PS5 with the DualSense controller is the premium way to play this game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"MotoGP 21 is a fine racing game, that surpasses its predecessor in a couple of subtle ways.

But instead of polishing it, the Italian studio has put the diamond in the next-gen's garage this season. MotoGP 21 is stagnating in the gameplay, the fault of the sets and animations still unchanged and quite dull, an AI that falls back into its faults causing too many accidents and the absence of a split screen mode. Worse, the title regresses in content, puts the historical mode to oblivion and brings no notable novelty to the career. Even the shimmering visual identity of MGP20 has given way to a dreary ersatz menu, enough to assure us of one thing: the next installment in the series will be expected around the corner.",,,"The steady improvement of MotoGP continues with MotoGP 21. The move to the PlayStation 5 affords a bunch of benefits inherent to the latest generation of consoles, and having a race load in a handful of seconds is such a nice luxury. The inclusion of the DualSense’s haptics is appreciated, as a useful feature to tell when tires are losing their grip. Brake temperature management combines with fuel consumption and tire wearing to increase immersion. It may still not excite much with a lacking presentation, but MotoGP 21 is a solid contender that’ll have you feeling like you could almost take to the track yourself. Just, watch those knees, yeah?",,"MotoGP 21 is the incarnation of the “less is more” creative philosophy. Milestone decided to direct every effort towards the race, improving the physics and the driving systems, making good use of every next-gen feature, including a brilliant PS5's DualSense implementation.

It has the official license that gives it access to all the official bikers and circuits but, above all, with a great job behind it that allows it to offer a pure and demanding simulation experience but that knows how to reward the player's effort. The package is surrounded by a technical section that gives lukewarm progress for the new generation and, above all, by the presence of that career mode that can become a real sink of hours.

MotoGP 21 continues to separate itself from the pack to the point that it’s standing alone in the racing genre. The deep Career Mode gets even deeper this year and continues to be the best one out there. It’s not convoluted or difficult to navigate besides the fact that it still doesn’t notify you if an engineer is working on something else before allocating them to a new R&D. What shines the most this year is the racing itself thanks largely in part to the DualSense. The haptic feedback completely changes how you race and gives more control of the bike. The Neural A.I., A.N.N.A., is also the best version that has been seen since its inception, but it still isn’t perfect.

It also makes fantastic use of the DualSense controller on the PlayStation 5. For every step forward this game takes forward though, it feels like it takes a step back elsewhere.

As per tradition, the one dedicated to the most famous two-wheeled world championship in the world has also proved to be one of Milestone's most solid annual releases. Strengthened by a substantial injection of content and a better organized career mode and finally worthy of being compared with that of the alter ego on four wheels by Codemasters, we are sure that MotoGP 21 will be able to give you dozens of hours of fun with braking , folds and millimeter overtaking. Since the main mode is particularly full-bodied and consists of a cumbersome managerial component, however, it may not fully satisfy the taste of the most hasty and eager players to launch on the track without too many frills.

On the track, however, we get improved and more realistic gameplay. At first it feels like a change for the worse, but the more we play, the more we like it.

There are clear improvements visually, with the physics, and with a few new features to aid realism. However, for every improvement, some areas are showing their age or have abandonment issues. The tutorial is as absorbing and educational as a brick wall, the career mode just feels shallow, and finding that balance for non-simulation purists can be a chore. Still, these are balanced by the strong racing when you find those perfect settings and the improving AI. Also, the use of the PlayStation 5's DualSense controller is brilliant, putting the feel of the bike into your hands.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"MotoGP 21 is a fine racer that’s realistic to a fault at times.

wwe-2k22,"WWE 2K22 is a fine wrestling game, but the most frustratingly realistic thing about it is just how hard it is to make new stars in it as it is in the WWE.","This is a re-establishment year for the WWE 2K series. Let’s face it, WWE 2K20 was rough and while it took more than 2 years to develop, 2K has re-emerged with a strong and not only playable wrestling game, but a fun one. The engine is better and the basics are tighter, but we’re looking forward to more layers in the future.",,,,,"WWE 2K22 manages to polish a lot of issues from the previous game, but it’s still not quite there yet. The good thing though is that it seems they put the first stone right, and the future of the series could be bright.","The extra year has done WWE 2K22 a world of good as the game appears more stable and enjoyable. The time in the ring has been simplified although might still appear more complex than some would like. Countering windows seem tricky to get a hold of and there are times when you feel the game is playing for you. Despite this, the wealth of content and gameplay should keep people interested. Not quite a return to form but definitely a step in the right direction.","WWE 2K22 is the face turn this series needed. The game looks incredible and the new gameplay mechanics help get new players up to speed and have some arcade fun with others. But still, even with those changes, the game still suffers from mediocracy in some places, mainly MyGM and the roster which is one of the weakest in the series.","This is by far the best WWE game in the franchise. The controls, game mechanics and all game modes have received significant upgrades, which is exactly what the series needed. If you are a long time fan of the series but you are a bit sceptical because of some of its previous iterations, don't worry. WWE 2K22 has definitely put wrestling back on the map!",,,"Though it's hardly a tall hurdle to clear, WWE 2K22 is the best WWE 2K game since they started appending '2K' to the title. Much more than that though, it's the best wrestling game to come along in a long, long time and one which almost completely banishes everything that has been historically wrong with the franchise, while also managing to strike out in a bold direction for the series' future. Here's hoping that the likely return to the annual release schedule doesn't result in a lapse to bad habits and lazy innovation because, well, we've been there for the last ten years or so - and it isn't fun.",,,,,A good recovery from 2K that puts the WWE back to its expected level in videogames.,,,,"I mean all the usual suspects of match types are available along with the always incredible create a wrestler(and other “create” options).

With a number of smart fixes, streamlined action gameplay, and a handful of engaging, well-designed modes, it has successfully shed the franchise’s bad reputation. A year off has certainly done the series good, and helped 2K Games and Visual Concepts rethink what makes wrestling so fun. WWE 2K22 is a game changer, and one that certainly does ‘hit different’.","A year off has truly been beneficial to the WWE 2K franchise – WWE 2K22 is by far the best entry in the series yet. It’s been a long time since a WWE 2K game has had us so keen to jump into one match after another, and that’s largely thanks to the numerous gameplay improvements that have been made. Add in a welcome layer of polish and a selection of modes that have all bases covered, and you have a winner. There’s still a little room for improvement, but if you’re a wrestling fan, consider this a must-have.","WWE2K22 has a TON of content that you wanted in a wrestling game.

And why? Because 2K22 is a ton of fun. It strikes a tremendous balance between its quick, arcadey gameplay and smooth, simulation-like animation system. Plus, the Showcase and MyFaction modes are fantastic, with the latter offering hours upon hours of gameplay. This is one I’ll be wrestling with for a long time. 2K finally put some proper chefs in the kitchen.",,"A surprisingly strong return to the squared circle, stellar presentation, a new gameplay engine, and robust modes make WWE 2K22 the best 2K in a long time.","WWE 2K22 fixes many of the serious bugs of the previous game and builds a solid foundation to build on with great gameplay and interesting game modes.

WWE 2K22 is a significant step up from what has come before, and I’m hopeful this becomes the building block for future entries in the series.","It may be a few years too late, but WWE 2K22 improves on the series in almost every way. The combat system being changed and made more reminiscent of a fighting game makes the matches faster and more exciting.","Superbly playable console wrestling, that is suffering from severely outdated technology.",,,,,,"WWE 2K22 is pure entertainment and an improvement in so many ways. Its refined combat system, tight controls, and plethora of modes give you the tools and freedom to make it be as fun as you want it to be. It does, however, suffer from some design choices that keep it from achieving greatness. It has the glitz and the glamour you’ve come to expect from the series, but it also feels humble, more approachable, and can still offer fans hours of fun until the next, hopefully even better, game comes out.","After a bad game two years back, we now have another good sequel in the series. Visual Concepts has taken its time and it works out well. Modi such as MyRISE and MyGM are very cool, the audiovisual is well done and the gameplay is very refined yet accessible, making it appeal to a wide audience. WWE 2K22 does have some sloppiness here and there, but that's okay.",,"WWE 2K22 is the return to form the WWE 2K series has desperately needed. Skipping 2K21 and delaying the release by five months may have caused the roster to be largely outdated, but the game is stable, plays great, and is practically bursting at the seams with content. An excellent Rey Mysterio Showcase really bolsters the experience, and every other mode (perhaps with the exception of MyFaction) sets a strong foundation for WWE games to come.","WWE 2K22 is a great wrestling game. Its grappling and strike mechanics are entertaining. The attack physics and animations work in perfect harmony. Doing a 619 on your opponent will be fun again. The development team delivered on their promise, and once again, you will be entertained jumping off the top rope over your opponent as Rey Mysterio does.",,,,"If it hasn't drastically changed its gameplay, WWE 2K22 is almost a reboot in its visual rendering and with the incorporation of the My MG mode. The latter is a good surprise, leads us to manage a stable of stars and a schedule of shows without being too complex, a successful bet. Technically, the latest generation of consoles holds its own and avoids the pitfall of WWE 2K20's many bugs, even if some loading times are long. In short, if this last opus could have been deeper in terms of staging, it delights in its lifespan thanks to an XXL roster, realistic in the animations without being polluted by the less vital virtual currency than in NBA 2K. A spectacular and versatile title, like the cover star Rey Mysterio.",,"WWE 2K22 is 2K Sports’ first mainline WWE game since 2019. Following the abysmal reception to 2K20 that year, 2K took an extra year to make sure bugs were squashed and character models looked the part while preserving the fun factor. The team behind the latest release has addressed most of these issues this time around, and while 2K22 is significantly better than its predecessor, the bar was absurdly low. The extra year has certainly helped, but ultimately, the final product still feels undercooked.",,"This score feels harsh as the gameplay is spectacular, but there are simply one too many niggles to consider this a true WWE legend. For everything included in the game, there's always something else that could have been improved to be more cohesive. I am absolutely not complaining about the level of content here, though. MyGM's half-baked design is still fun the first time around, and MyRISE is definitely one of the better career modes in years, so you get enough bang for your buck. Throw in the wonderfully fluid new combat system and top-notch presentational qualities, and it feels like the franchise is back on track -- and on the cusp of something special.","After the disaster of 2020, Visual Concepts and 2K Sports are back with WWE 2K22, a significantly improved game in every respect. The new control system, an incredible amount of content and the showcase mode dedicated to Rey Mysterio make this year's edition a must buy for WWE wrestling fans.","What a comeback! WWE22 makes its big return and delivers a fun, good-looking and playable wrestling-experience. While the game is far from perfect, its mechanics and overall options are well designed to keep fans motivated.

The visuals are a sight to behold and the combat is fluid and fun. The simplification of combat and the modes makes this much more approachable for everyone without having to figure out a bunch of alternate moves and backwards ways of pulling off things that are seen on TV. MyGM will keep players occupied forever and Showcase Mode is the best version to date. MyRISE is a nice addition with a ton of variation to keep things fresh, but ultimately remains a grind. MyFACTION, while sounding good on paper, is just MyTEAM from NBA 2K and its filled with microtransactions. If you’re one of those players that pick up a WWE game every couple of years, 2K22 is the one to get.","After a year off, WWE 2K22 returns with new modes, new controls, and a new attitude. Turns out, taking a break can be a good thing.","WWE is back with a fun game that serves as the promising foundation for all the good things that, we hope, will come with the future entries.","If there was a word to summarize how fans will feel with this title, it would be Surprised. Surprised to see how much love and care was put into this title, from entrances to the sheer amount of things for you to customize within the world.

If you’re a wrestling fan, chances are you’re probably going to have fun diving into the various modes and match types. Although there’s no shortage of things to do or ways to play, having too many ideas often means that most of them aren’t executed to their full potential. At the heart of it all, this is a wrestling video game experience that feels inherently cumbersome, buggy, and dated.","WWE 2K22 is a classic game of the WWE 2K series, which aims to clear up what has been confounded and set things right. For instance, it makes sincere improvements in a series of aspects, including screen expression, operation and game models, thereby greatly improving the playability of the game. Although it does not surprise players as much as WWE 2K19, it still succeeds in bringing this series of games back to the right track, so that players are full of expectations for its subsequent works.

Although the game is much more fun than its predecessors because of the improved gameplay mechanics, it still has some technical issues and some of the game modes are rather disappointing.","While not perfect, it is hard not to be excited about the first genuinely enjoyable WWE title in what seems like an age.",,,,"Despite a few problems with the game's responsiveness when in the ring with multiple people, and a couple of lacklustre modes, there's plenty in WWE 2K22 to keep you very happy indeed, especially if you've played wrestling games before. The real pleasure with WWE 2K22 is in the hilarious community creations and chaotic action in the ring with friends.

The extra year of development has done a world of good, and the only hope now is that the series doesn't return to an annual schedule. There are still failings when it comes to multi-person matches, and not all of the new modes are particularly engaging, but 2K22 establishes a solid foundation for the future. Ideally, WWE will calm down when it comes to gutting its roster, and the next game in the series won't feel quite as outdated. It will also be interesting to see how Yuke's upcoming AEW game fares.

That said, promises of a “completely rebuilt” experience ring hollow as it’s clear old tech is still being used, and while the action has been refined, it remains a notch below most other fighting or combat sports games you could name. Your reaction to the game will largely hinge on how you felt about 2K’s series before its hiatus, with those that still saw promise likely to have a good time.

The core gameplay isn’t quite as solid as it was in 2K19, but that’s something that can be improved upon later in some ways with things like a patch at least being able to do things like address locking in carry holds.

Though it’s a little on the long side, it feels completely worth the time investment. The game has a solid ending, and after the credits roll, an entire post-game opens up with 35 more episodes of content covering the aftermath of the game’s events.

Season is a contemplative experience that helps to break the rhythm of modern society and serves to rest and heal the soul.

This is a game that has moved me in ways no other has, but no matter how much it gave me to think about, when it was over, the only thought in my head was, “Is that all there is?”",,As it turned out Season: A Letter to the Future was nothing more than just another forgettable indie title. Even if gorgeous trailers made you think otherwise.,,,,"There’s something special about the power that Season: A Letter to the Future gives to the player; the freedom you have to explore, to document, to see and do exactly as you wish. Free of threat and any real time pressure, you’ll simply become absorbed, seeing everything for the first time just as your protagonist is. For the action-oriented amongst you, that might sound a little dull.

As it stands, it’s kind of like that, but is far more concerned with making sure you feel guided and, more importantly, relaxed at all times. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Season has a vibe, and that vibe is all about brewing up a chamomile, settling down under a blanket, and enjoying the ride.",,"Season’s unwillingness to paint the world in anything but the broadest strokes (“The country’s expansion caused a war. Internationalism was breaking down”) and penchant for flowery but meaningless language may have been influenced by a troubled development history.

It is a beautifully crafted walking simulator, with a unique atmosphere and some memorable moments, but no replay value at all.",Season A Letter to the Future is the PS5 gem of the beginning of this year. The atmospheric game captivates from the very first seconds thanks to its poetry and melancholy. A splendid and magnetic game as much on the visual level as the writing of its dreamlike universe. An artistic spectacle as sublime as its narrative premise that remains intriguing during the few hours needed to complete it.,,,,"While the voice acting is a little below par, the writing is superb, crafting meaningful, emotional moments seemingly at will, while walking a delicate tonal line between sadness and catharsis. What you're left with is a fascinating, emotionally powerful experience not soon to leave you.",,,,"A poignant, slow-paced but ultimately shallow exploration of memory and legacy in a changing world, that also manages to be the world’s first cycle-based walking simulator.","A purely atmospheric experience, Season: a letter to the future is a little candy, a poem about the passing years and their memories which, strangely, transports you completely out of time. A road trip by bike made of absolutely charming encounters that enjoys excellent sound work. A must-do for lovers of short narrative experiences in which you can easily let yourself be transported.",,"Season is an extremely chill game about leaving home for the first time, touring the world on a bike, and recording the wonders you find along the way. Also, the world might be ending, but no one is letting that ruin their day. While it’s filled with scenes of beauty, Season’s awkward pace and muddled message leave it feeling a little undercooked.",,"All up, the credits rolled at the seven-hour mark on my end. SEASON didn’t overstay its welcome as some games often do, though conversely, it also doesn’t offer any reason to return once you’ve seen and done it all. As mentioned prior, there aren’t any checklists, you won’t find challenges here, and there’s nothing to collect beyond personal keepsakes for your journal. So one playthrough is all you’ll need here and if you don’t embrace a slower style of play, one where you really take your time to capture everything just right, you’ll likely finish the game in a few short hours. It’s certainly not a game for everyone, but for those who do take their time to thoroughly travel the open world and take in every sight and sound, there’s a truly wonderful time to be had in SEASON: A letter to the future.",,,Season: A Letter to the Future is an experience committed to the art of environmental storytelling. Although how much you connect with the world will be determined by your enjoyment of slow-paced adventures with minimal gameplay and the way you interpret the narrative.,,,"Clearly inspired by real places, Tieng Valley exists firmly in the realm of magical realism, with a god of forgetting looming over the valley while strange flowers whisper echoes of the past. Biking around, recording it is a meditative experience that not only interrogates how you as an outsider choose to remember this ephemeral space, but also asks wider questions about time, history, and memory. It’s a genuine pleasure to explore. The game doesn’t outstay its welcome at about ten hours long, and is absolutely an experience we won’t forget in a hurry. [Issue#24, p.75]",,,"An intimite, mindful story of journalling what matters hits a few small bumps in the road.",,"But more than anything, I disliked Season’s belief in its own profundity. Its mysticism felt like cod-Buddhist leftovers, while its nonchalant efficacy of prayer undermined its attempts at agnostic universalism, all crushed under the weight of the sheer banality of all your actions being delivered as if creating a vital tome of historical significance.",,"Season is your journey of finding that ephemeral magic and making it permanent. Even as we stand outside in the rain, waiting for god or whoever is behind that door to let us inside, there is no other day exactly like today and there never will be again — and that alone makes it worth cherishing. Season is about every little thing we can value in a life as fleeting as the seasons, and it’s one of my favorite games in years. [Polygon Recommends]",,,Quotation forthcoming.,,,,,,SEASON: A Letter to the Future has all the markings of a relaxing adventure that has something to say about the nature of change.,,"Season: A Letter to the Future allows players to roam a valley marked by its past and populated by a handful of unforgettable characters. The humanity on the verge of abandoning Tieng Valley is full of dreams and has stories of love and loss to tell. Scavengers Studio manufactures an invite to meditation and a hymn to human bonds and nostalgia that is also a celebration of the capability to become independent and strive forth without fear, on board a bicycle that sets a new standard for the use of DualSense's features.",,"Season: A Letter to the Future is a unique narrative experience, which reminds us how precious every single moment of life is as we face a season on the verge of its end. You will be captured by the atmosphere of the game and it will be difficult to detach yourself until the epilogue; at the same time, however, it is a journey to be played at a slow pace, enjoying the landscape views and the memories left by the characters who have inhabited this world, without the rush to get to the end credits. Kind of how one should live, after all.",,,"It’s difficult to put into words my experience with this game. It offered a strange peace that was, all at once, a somber experience — one full of joy, sorrow, laughter, and regret. It explores the weight and comfort of memories, the impact they have on the world, and the importance of existence. It can be meandering at times, and some of the side characters’ voice acting pulled me out of the experience. If you aren’t in the mood for this kind of game — a walking simulator vibe with an emphasis on scrapbooking, bicycling, and photography — hold off on playing it and wait until the right mood strikes. When you go in with the right mindset, this game can get under your skin in the best way. Season: A Letter To The Future isn’t a perfect game, but it is a significant one, and one that I will carry with me for a long time.",,,,"If memory can be an anchor and the future an unknown, then Season: A Letter to the Future asks us to be mindful of the present as we explore the beautiful world it has created. Armed with a camera, a recorder and diary, riding a bicycle trough gorgeous sceneries, we dive in a story about memories and new eras to unravel. To say it's not for everyone is to belittle both the game and those who play it, so it's really best to recommend it to everyone. Change is scary, but maybe Season will help us find some answers.",,,,,,,,,,,"SEASON’s intended time for a single playthrough is around six hours, which I found a slightly awkward length. Its subtler environmental stories would lose their impact if not experienced in a single play session, but the deliberately slow and self-driven nature of its exploration makes this an arduous ask. It almost feels as though part of the experience was cut, or that it was originally intended to be broken into chapters more rigorously. Despite this, SEASON is an emotional and well-written narrative adventure. Immersive and reflective, it takes the grandeur of an epic journey like The Artful Escape and condenses it into something more like Firewatch: a series of personal, microcosmic stories that feel incredibly real.",,"Cycling, photographing, enjoying: something short but wonderful narrative adventure with many exciting stories.",,,"SEASON: A Letter to the Future is a beautiful game. If you enjoy an action-free adventure and intricate stories, then you'll thoroughly enjoy exploring the colourful world on offer. The innovative use of the DualSense controller creates a fun sense of immersion as you pedal through the landscapes. Although the interactions with other characters are few and far between, they all come with their own personalities and backstories, which I enjoyed more than the main storyline. Overall, SEASON: A Letter to the Future is a relaxing narrative experience with wonderful art and sound design.","SEASON: A letter to the future is unique, relaxing and beautiful; even more important, it's a game with something to say. In general, explore this world is satisfying if you connect with the concept and topics. However, it isn't an experience for everyone. Some will find it boring and repetitive.","Season: a Letter to the Future is strange. When everything works perfectly and you find yourself in front of one of the stupendous landscapes that make it up, which tell long stories without the need for many words, it is a work of art that leaves you speechless. The freedom given to the player to define the shape of Estelle's adventure and literally bring the season's sunset diary to life is a breath of fresh air, but not strong enough to take flight and the story ends up stopping after a few bars, interrupting a speech suddenly, giving the impression of having left something unfinished.",,,,,,"Season is a phenomenal work, not just the classic little pearl, but an all-round videogame experience capable of excite, tell, immerse us in the last moments of a reality that could end, change, mutate. A memorization and movement mechanism within towns, villages and glimpses of nature of disarming beauty.",,,,,,,,,,,"Season: A Letter to the future feels like the perfect antidote for someone that’s grown a bit tired of epic, action-heavy adventure games. Scavengers Studio delivers an adventure game that’s warm and peaceful, but still fulfilling and thought-provoking. Although the movement controls can feel a bit clunky, Season: A Letter to the future is an easy recommendation.",,"As Estelle pieces together her scrapbook made by my hand, I often found myself asking why I took a particular image, what I liked about a specific sound. What memories or feelings was I conjuring, even subconsciously, that led me to present Estelle's world in the ways I did, and what did that say about how I see my own world? Season asks a lot of introspective questions, provides few definitive answers, and hopes players are willing to breathe it in, consider it carefully, then exhale slowly as they reflect on both the game and themselves. It's unconventional even in a sea of indies that are constantly trying new weird things, but it works.",,,,,,,,,,,"It took me a little over seven hours to wrap up the story, and while I didn’t see everything, I definitely made sure to seek out the most interesting places and details. I felt just like the main character: venturing out into the great unknown, constantly surprised and amazed by what I found.",,,"Season: A letter to the future offers plenty of moments of low-key beauty and, at its best, makes you truly feel part of a unique and enigmatic world on the verge of great upheaval. Unfortunately, the game’s abrupt ending and reluctance to make meaningful statements about the subjects it brings up may leave you questioning what it all meant. While an often-pleasant slice of virtual tourism, as a complete game this one feels a bit underseasoned.",,,,"Still, minor quibbles aside, SEASON: A letter to the future is a beautiful and ethereal gaming experience about what is both permanent and impermanent in our lives. I was satisfied with the conclusion my particular journey took, finding the game to be genuinely moving and inspiring in unexpected ways. SEASON: A letter to the future is one journey adventure game fans will want to experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,"More than anything else, Season is about the vibe it cultivates. Asking you to pause, actually look and listen to your surroundings, not just as a way to work on your journal but as a way of life. It is certainly a beautiful experience, one I couldn’t help but reflect on even after I’d put it down. But outside of that, it is a little bit short, and there doesn’t seem to be too much in the way of replay value. If you’re down with that vibe, you’ll find this a very relaxing experience with some entertaining worldbuilding and a few mysteries for suspense. However, being pretty much a one-off experience more like a movie may rub a lot of gamers the wrong way.","Season: A letter to the future has style to spare and some captivating story elements. Exploring its little world is rewarding, but it's so frictionless as to lack the drama of other exploration-focused games like The Witness or Journey.",,,,,,,,,,"Every system in SEASON seems to just be encapsulated by highs and lows. There will be something I'm really enjoying like the act of cycling, but then simultaneously an annoyance or disruption will creep in and spoil it. That is not to say there is nothing to enjoy within SEASON - quite the contrary, with the form of a great game clearly here. Aspects like the haptic feedback and active preservation excel within the game, but there is far too much clasping on the brakes to get the rhythm going, even in such a short game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vampire-the-masquerade---bloodhunt,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As battle royale efforts go, Bloodhunt is surprising; which is more than other like-minded efforts can lay claim to. Though cross play remains unbalanced against more capable PC players and concerns over balancing and map variety remain, Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodhunt nonetheless brings a scintillating blend of furious traversal, inspired PvE design and neat lore from the World of Darkness setting to fashion one of the most refreshing battle royale efforts in quite some time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bloodhunt is a robust and remarkably well-crafted battle royale. It might not bring the genre back from the dead entirely, but it’s still a bloody good time. [Issue#15, p.96]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vampire :The Masquerade: Bloodhunt is a solid battle royale with huge potential that it’s not quite reaching just yet. The traversal and rooftop battles are huge fun and the map is terrific. So long as Sharkmob believe in it, there could be something pretty special here down the line.",,,"Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt is a pleasant and interesting battle royale, with some original ideas (classes, powers, civilians to bite) and an extremely dynamic gameplay.","Even in its final version, Vampire The Masquerade Bloodhunt continues to be a fun product with enormous potential that, however, struggles to live up to expectations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,This sort of game lives or dies on how much support it receives from the developers but at this point in time Bloodhunt is a blast that is sure to entertain Battle Royale players and fans of the Vampire IP.,,,,,,,,,Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt turns us into vampires to show us the pros and cons. The formula of this Battle Royale offers a different proposal to what we know. The fights through the streets and rooftops of Prague will be part of the appeal of the game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vampire The Masquerade Blood Hunt doesn't revolutionize the battle royal style, but brings some fresh new features thanks to a solid level design and nice gameplay options. A good BR game, a bit different from what we are now used to play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-ascent,,,,,,,,"The Ascent is cyberpunk done right. It might just be the best looking game on PSN and with its excellent action and wide range of weapons and upgrades, The Ascent is truly a joy to play.",,,,,"A robustly entertaining cyberpunk dungeon crawler wrapped up in some of the most sublime audiovisual presentation and thoroughly satisfying combat to come along in a good while, though it isn't quite as ambitious as I would like it to be, the Ascent is nonetheless a fantastically entertaining offering that will appeal to genre fans of cyberpunk settings and dungeon crawlers alike.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I must reiterate that The Ascent is gorgeous, and for a team of just a dozen developers, they have outperformed themselves in that regard. Unfortunately, because the narrative is so anaemic and there is so little that connects the narrative to the aesthetics and gameplay, The Ascent ends up feeling empty. There’s nothing memorable about the characters, the world is dull and far too large for how little it offers, and while, yes, the story hits those key cyberpunk talking points, the developers largely missed the nuances that elevate cyberpunk beyond pulp fiction. So, again, the game’s fine, if you are looking for a generic sci-fi shooter (and can ideally drag a friend along). As a work of cyberpunk, though, it’s a failure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Ascent on PS5 is the same game with a few tweaks. Best played with friends, it provides a gorgeous, if inconsistent, experience.",,"The Ascent provides a vibrant, living environment for you to run around in and shoot at. The world is brimming with walking-talking NPCs and neon-filled areas. While the story isn't really that memorable, it's decent enough for you to push on to the next mission, which will lead you to diverse locations and up against different enemies. The bigger enemies can be a bit too much bullet sponges, but otherwise the gameplay and diverse possibilities are quite satisfying.",,"Overall, The Ascent is a fun twin-stick shooter that comes to the Playstation with an absolutely beautiful world design. The wholesale violence is very engaging but may feel a bit redundant as you can be pretty well maxed out about halfway through. I had a lot of fun with The Ascent, especially with multiplayer. It’s a beautiful-looking game that’s a blast to play that’s worth checking out.",,,"The Ascent is, for fans of a good isometric RPG with a futuristic theme, one of the best experiences in recent years. Aesthetically beautiful, it is not the most innovative experience in terms of both story and gameplay, but it manages to be competent in everything it proposes, resulting in an intense and surprisingly immersive journey.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Ascent is far from perfect. It has so many issues that normally I would not give it a second look. Despite all the issues and the fact that the gameplay is pretty basic, the story completely forgettable and it lacks any depth, I had fun with it and once I started playing it I was lost to the rest of the world. It is more a twin stick shooter adorned tackily with superfluous RPG elements. It is raw, unrefined and basic, but the atmosphere and the overall experience recommends The Ascent as a game that is worth a shot after a few patches and a serious discount.",,,,,"The Ascent's a solid, if somewhat repetitive shooter, propped up by eye-popping environments and a reasonable amount of RPG depth. If you can stomach some grindy mission design and the occasional buggy interaction, then there's explosive fun to be had here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The story and its telling are a little disappointing, as is the way you suddenly find yourself out of your depth if you’re slightly underlevelled. And we really want to get more hands-on with this world! Still, it’s a great (and great-looking) option for anybody with an itchy trigger finger. [Issue#13, p.79]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Ascent has the kind of graphical and audio design prowess that many games can only dream of. While some technical and mechanical issues disrupt the immersion, there’s no denying the sheer sadistic joy that comes from shredding through the neon glazed tiers of Veles. A critique of the Cyberpunk genre this isn’t, but damn is it a blast to play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
solar-ash,,,,"This beautiful, high-velocity leap into the unknown deserves points for style AND daring. [Issue#367, p.102]",,,,,,,,,"While I would have liked a bit more variety, what Solar Ash gives is a beautiful, vivid, technological adventure that drips with style. Its fluid traversal, combat and puzzle-like sections are a joy to navigate, as are its hulking bosses. Solar Ash is like nothing else on the market at the moment and that alone is enough for me to recommend it. What more could you want than a stunning, fluid, unique game? Not much, I reckon.",,,,,,,,,,"Solar Ash is repetitive and short, but that doesn't take away from how fun the core gameplay is. The developers have nailed Solar Ash's traversal system, making it genuinely fun to explore and complete the various platforming challenges. The art style is striking, the bosses are impressive, and while it may not have the same lasting impact Hyper Light Drifter did, Solar Ash is still worth checking out for fans of Heart Machine's work and the 3D platformer genre in general.","Solar Ash excels when it captures that dream-like feeling of gliding across cosmic, surreal spaces. There are moments when the speed of Rei’s skates across the back of a terrifying monster will exhilarate, reminding players why they love games. But as a platformer, Solar Ash can be tedious, repetitive, and a bit clumsy. While these issues may clash with the lovingly crafted world and gravity-defying puzzles, they never truly harm what is ultimately a uniquely engaging game.",,"Solar Ash is a platforming playground that never loses steam, and it hides a memorable story of unfathomable tragedy.",,"There are certainly moments where Solar Ash excels, whether it’s by offering an environmental puzzle to crack or a first peek at some jaw-dropping scenery which is also, thankfully, fully traversable. It’s visually brilliant in so many ways, with twirled geometry to scale and slide upon, all of which is very consistent with the themes of its main questline. Furthermore, the present PlayStation 5 version manages these sights with aplomb, all quick load times and barely a stutter to be found. In its lesser moments, it comes off as a singular presentation looking for a more involved game underneath, better combat and better bosses which could more effectively serve these assets. It still remains a worthwhile quest to see through to the end, but games like Solar Ash are frustrating in that they could have been so much more.",,"Solar Ash is a highly original open-plan platform game. A slim move set that rewards momentum is the perfect means of exploring its swirling, broken landscapes and executing its more exacting challenges. While some of its elements feel overly simple, that doesn’t detract hugely from a clinically focused and fresh experience.",,,,"Solar Ash offers a collection of promising concepts that don’t quite hit realization. While undoubtedly a visually striking experience, Rei’s journey into the Ultravoid suffers due to a disengaging narrative and repetitious gameplay. Solar Ash’s attractive world struggles to provide the player with captivating experiences. Elements do occasionally come together, however, in the form of fun traversal, unsettling creature design, and dazzling vistas, ensuring that while Solar Ash isn’t quite the release it might have been, it successfully retains an unmistakable Heart Machine charm.",,"Solar Ash feels like a middle ground between something like Jet Set Radio and Shadow of the Colossus. Sadly, the new game by Heart Machine lacks any meaningful ambitions or novelty, and yet if you love the genre, Solar Ash is worth a try.",,,,"Although I didn’t care much for its story, Solar Ash still got its hooks in me. That sweet, speedy traversal is second to none; the almost-rhythmic pattern of gliding, jumping and grinding to get to those hard-to-reach areas and to take down gargantuan bosses is oh-so satisfying when you nail it. It misses a trick by not including any DualSense features, though – a bit of feedback as you move through the environment would take the game to the next level – but even without it, it’s a very nice world to get lost in indeed.","Solar Ash defines the new standard for open-world indie games by providing an absolutely lovely world to traverse, with a beautiful soundtrack to listen to. From the flow of movement and smooth platforming, to the giant colossi and heartwarming story, I had to step back to discover I was playing a fine piece of art.",,,This unquestionably beautiful game about saving a planet from an encroaching black hole boldly goes where few have remained awake.,,"Solar Ash has the audiovisual stile of Hyper Light Drifter, the fights against titans of Shadow of the Colossus, the traversal mechanics of Jet Set Radio and the level design of Super Mario Galaxy. Do we really need to say anything else?","Solar Ash is a spectacular achievement and a worthy successor to Heart Machine’s previous release. The fast and fluid movement makes exploration a delightful dance through the absurd. Although the structure is a little repetitive, the moment-to-moment gameplay is thrilling. Large and intense boss battles are the highlight of the game, creating jaw-dropping sequences that will leave you yearning for more.",,,,,,,"Controlling Rei in Solar Ash’s beautiful world is an absolute joy, with fluid, precise, and simple controls as well as a diverse set of challenges to overcome. Unfortunately, there are more than a few moments where the normally excellent level design suddenly becomes tedious and annoying.",,"Solar Ash is one of the most beautiful games of the year and plays incredibly fluid at times. Unfortunately, frustrating boss battles and erratic controls throw a spanner in the works, because this beautiful game world deserves to be explored and the platforming puzzles are fun to do.",,"By making Solar Ash radically different from Hyper Light Drifter, Heart Machine has avoided boxing themselves into a niche while being able to continue and build a universe they clearly care for. It wears its influences on its sleeve and comes together as a cosmic mix of a few games held dear by many, and as long as they continue to do this, I’ll eat it up until I am far beyond full.","If you are a fan of traversal-based games, or you just want a quick indie game to play through, I do not think you can go wrong with Solar Ash. The repetitive gameplay, poor PS5 optimization, and lack of replayability are definite downsides, but it is still a fun and intense game to play.",,"Solar Ash does fast-paced platforming brilliantly and it features a super-exciting formula to boot. At the same time, that's really all it has going for it so with some much-needed additional variety, it could have been an even greater experience.",,,,,,,,"Solar Ash pushes for a sense of momentum and fluidity with its take on 3D platforming, and it does work very well indeed. Rei's controls and abilities give the game a sense of ease, making it feel very gratifying simply moving through the game's world. While the main quest doesn't really evolve the challenge, and the picturesque environments can feel somewhat empty, the traversal at the heart of everything does about enough to carry you through to a satisfying conclusion. It's an ambitious second effort from Heart Machine that mostly sticks the landing.",,Solar Ash will excite the player thanks to its creative visuals and smooth movement but it soon gets too repetitive and loses its originality and challenge.,,"An excellent sci-fi platformer with exquisite art design and sublime traversal mechanics, which finds distinctive ground among its obvious inspirations.","Rich in a singular aura and delicious journeys, Solar Ash is home to a universe that must be patiently tamed to be fully appreciated; between the so comfortable walks there are some great difficulties to overcome. From top to bottom, the cosmic and complex regions built by Heart Machine make one want to be fully excavated. Too bad that each new panorama discovered shelters objectives which often fail to disorient us.",Where Solar Ash goes from an intriguing ambient platformer to one of the year’s most fascinating releases is in its fixation on living as an act of being stuck.,,,,,,"Solar Ash is a visually pleasing adventure that pulls you in quickly with its swift and elegant movement mechanics and a snazzy synth soundtrack. Despite the strong start, the experience begins to lose its grip the longer it goes, with unreliable performance and mundane combat.",,,"Few games feel as good to play as this, but the demanding platforming might not suit all. A heady mix of challenge and reward. Plus, space rollerskates. [Issue#10, p.76]",,,,,"Ultimately, Solar Ash left me in similar standing as the protagonist: a little awed, a little confused, a little satisfied, a little frustrated, wishing I fully understood this thing that doesn’t want to be fully understood, that so badly wants to go where few have gone before, yet backs away moments before taking the leap.",,,,"Solar Ash hinges itself upon two core mechanics -- and almost nothing else. Skating around and dispelling corrupted masses of black goo is fun for a while, but when you've seen a game's whole hand in the first half-hour, it's a little hard to stay on board for the remainder.","Even with some small flaws, Solar Ash manages to offer a beautiful adventure, with solid gameplay and unforgettable moments.","Solar Ash is a contemplative experience, visual feast, and faced-paced thrill ride expertly wrapped up into one exhilarating adventure. Without a doubt, this game is one of the best indie games of 2021, if not the best.","Solar Ash is one of the best games of the year. It looks gorgeous, its story is pretty unique and surprising, and its set-piece moments get really intense, as you might expect from skating along the back of a black goo and bone dragon. It's a nice surprise to end the year with that any ""skating combined with combat and gigantic monsters"" enthusiasts, which is definitely already a thing.",,,,"Even with some rough edges, Heart Machine's latest is an endearing 3D platformer with its own unique hooks, carried by some strong lore, level design and aesthetics.",,"A brilliant game, strengthened by an amazing art direction and great design that makes progression natural. It's definitely not perfect, some of its design solutions aren't as elegant and perfectly integrated as others, and its narrative falls flat most of the time, but in the end it's another great demonstration of Heart Machine's talent.",,"Solar Ash is a solid second effort from the talented people at Heart Machine Games, with an intoxicating sense of freedom, good boss fights and a gorgeous soundtrack. It's less polished and less deep than its predecessor, but it's worth your time and money.",,,,,,,,"Solar Ash deserves props for its world design, the fluidity of movement when you're in the groove, and the sense of scale on display, so it's somewhat painful to be down on it to the degree I am. It's not far from being a bit special, the kind of indie gem that everyone has to play, but it's unfortunately just not quite there. There's still a great deal of fun to be had here, and your mileage with the mechanics might be better, but for me Solar Ash is so focused on delivering flow, it forgot that you don't want to go on the same walk every day.",,,,,,,,"If you have a few hours to spend and want to play something that is unlike anything else this year, then Solar Ash is absolutely worth checking out. Anyone who is a fan of the action-adventure genre will no doubt enjoy this memorable experience.",,,,,,,,,,,"Solar Ash had me racing across its cloud-covered playgrounds in the early hours, searching for the next fun platforming segment. By the remaining hours, I was running to see the conclusion of its gripping narrative. Solar Ash oozes as much substance as it does style, making for a wholly entertaining space romp.",,,,,,,,,,,"Solar Ash looks and feels awesome to play — when it works. When it doesn't, it's a frustrating experience.",,"With a first run taking 10 hours or less, Solar Ash is a focused affair that delivers on its vision without getting distracted by extraneous missions or checklists. The scale of its massive creatures pairs well with strong level design and interesting characters. It’s hard to avoid comparisons, but bold visuals and a sense of agility help separate Solar Ash from its inspirations and provide a surreal journey that’s all its own.",,,"Solar Ash will go down as an absolute triumph of form and function, a storytelling masterclass amongst a perfectly crafted visual and audible feast. They left it to the last moment to drop right near the top of my best of 2021, but Heart Machine should be proud of their accomplishments across the board.","There's a reason this space is so dreamily built--Solar Ash takes place inside a massive black hole, after all--but the game is at its best when it isn't treating those reasons as if they matter all that much. The late game leans a little too heavily into the story, including swapping out the strong boss battles in favor of a binary choice in the game's climactic moments. But, most of the time, that story is where it belongs: in the background. And, thankfully, Solar Ash has some gorgeous backgrounds.",,"I feel comfortable saying that Solar Ash is going to be someone's favorite game. It has a singular artistic vision and a strong enough message that, for the right person at the right time in their life, it's going to ring true in a way that will resonate with them, perhaps like no other work of art. It's also hard to deny the game's visual splendor. For me, it is a game that I wish I loved, but only liked, and I fear that will be the most common experience. There are a few too many flaws to overlook, and it's hard not to compare it to the masterpieces it hoped to emulate. That said, the video game world could do with more ambitious, imperfect works like Solar Ash and fewer safer bets. It may not be quite the masterwork that Hyper Light Drifter was, but it's still likely to stick with you after the credits roll.",,,,,Graceful movement and jaw-dropping fights against colossal monsters make Solar Ash a worthy follow-up to Hyper Light Drifter. [Recommended],,,,,,,"Solar Ash makes a good first impression with its silky-smooth controls, eye-catching visuals, and bombastic boss battles, but a lack of character progression or changes to core mechanics eventually drains some of the life from the game. Solar Ash is a solid action-platformer, but it doesn’t really rise above the many other indies occupying the same space, and ultimately, you may find your memories of the game disappearing rather swiftly into the void.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Anybody who likes fast-paced platformers with a gorgeous sense of style will enjoy Solar Ash. Who knows – maybe fans of a certain blue hedgehog can play a good 3D game for once.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
immortals-fenyx-rising,,,,,,"Immortals Fenyx Rising does not manage to have the superb gameplay of Assassin’s Creed and the magic of a Zelda: it is in between. Its gameplay is effective, and its puzzles very well thought out and with its humor and its enchanting universe to the charming artistic direction it manages to retain the player but it misses this little something to make a great game that we will not forget because it lacks depth.",,"While it may not be the most original game ever, Immortals: Fenyx Rising is a great experience that offers plenty to do in the lush, vibrant and brutal backdrop of Greek mythology. On each fundamental aspect of the open-world action-RPG genre, this experience delivers to a capable degree, it just may take some players a few hours to find their footing.",,,,,"With Immortals: Fenyx Rising, Ubisoft has created a refreshingly compact throwback open-world adventure that can be forgiven for its aggressive repurposing of other games best bits because it shapes them to fits its own style. The exploration is brisk and eventful, the puzzles are varied, with the right level of challenge and simplicity, and the approach to storytelling ultimately pays off. The DualSense features are a bit hit and miss, and it’s not exactly the best advert for the power of PS5, but much like the game it cribs from, Immortals’ qualities outshine any need for major technical showcases.",,"Even though it borrows clearly from other games, Immortals Fenyx Rising applies those ideas beautifully to come up with a fun adventure mixed with comical storytelling.",,,,,"Overall, this is a fantastic new IP for Ubisoft and they should be commended for allowing this development team to pursue an idea that sprung out of the Assassin’s Creed development.",,,,"Though Immortals Fenyx Rising may borrow familiar elements from other series, this new IP from Ubisoft establishes a unique identity through the lens of Greek mythology by using humor, intelligent puzzles, powerful combat, and clever world building.",,,,,,"The only saving grace is that some of the elements it lifts from much better games are recreated adequately, so fans of those titles might find some of the fun of going to see a cover band of your favourite artist. You’ve likely not only played Immortals Fenyx Rising before, you’d played a better version of it.","Immortals Fenyx Rising is Ubisoft's most pleasant surprise in years. The combination of its puzzles, battles, exploration and charismatic storytelling make for one of the most compelling games that the developer has ever worked on. Furthermore, if you enjoy the tales and myths from ancient Greece, you'll definitely be delighted.","It is very hard to avoid comparing Immortals to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Despite obvious inspirations it is a typical Ubi-game with all its pros and cons, an inventory screen copied almost exactly from Assassin’s Creed, and a store with premium items. Anyhow, it’s Ubisoft’s most interesting game in years, definitely worth checking out for its satisfying exploration accompanied by simple combat and tons of good puzzles. [01/2021, p.62]",,"It might be sloppy sometimes, even in regards to the conversation of open world adventures, but it offers up a lot of fast-paced arcade fun.","It is not an unforgivable sin that Immortals Fenyx Rising does not live up to Breath of the Wild, a tall task that its upcoming sequel might not even be capable of doing. But it is quite disappointing that it only plays dress up with the hero’s tunic and misses what that green garment stands for. Puzzles sometimes have inventive solutions yet the good ones are drowned out by how often they repeat and how few tools Fenyx has. And the game’s colorful world isn’t a sandbox that needs exploring, but is more akin to a typical open-world map littered with repeatable, obviously marked activities. These shortcomings make it less of Ubisoft’s take on Breath of the Wild and more of a Ubisoft-branded “Breath of the Mild” that could have been so much more.",,,,,"While it may seem a little basic at first, and players may wander into encounters that they’re really not prepared for, it soon settles down into a hugely enjoyable historical romp that is suitable for all ages and skill levels. The cutesy art style is just the icing on the cake, drawing you into a world that is charming and vibrant. With its clear Breath of the Wild inspirations, Ubisoft’s Immortals Fenyx Rising might just be the surprise hit of the year.",,,"Immortals Fenyx Rising is an excellent adventure with challenging and intricate puzzles, a wonderful combat system, and a rich world ripe for exploring.","The result is a game about mythology that somehow lacks a sense of mystery. It’s fun to play and I dare say I will keep chipping away at it for weeks to come, but say what you want about Norwich in the dark ages – at least there was real depth beneath all that mud.",,,"At first glance, it may seem like Immortals is a mish-mash of several games that came before but it’s from the ashes of these that Fenyx Rises. Oozing with charm, you’ll fall in love with the characterization and delivery of the narrative and want to explore every nook and cranny of the rich and diverse Grecian world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immortals Fenyx Rising is a nice adventure at the crossroads of Nintendo's Breath of the Wild and the Assassin's Creed saga. By using elements form both series, Ubsioft delivers a colorful and diverse experience, which still suffers from some inaccuracies, within the many fights of puzzles scattered all around the world.",,"This game offers a refreshing adventure within the Ubisoft repertoire and although it lends several elements of other titles, in this setting and combination it feels good and in a certain sense innovative. The gameplay offers plenty of variety, graphically it is beautiful and there is plenty to experience. Only the DualSense implementation is more annoying than useful and Fenyx tends to continuously climb up everywhere, which can be a bit frustrating. But these are no points to ignore the game, the adventure is more than worth it.",,"While Immortals Fenyx Rising may not have too many ideas to call its own, Ubisoft has created a successful amalgamation worth checking out. Simplistic but enjoyable combat provides the basis for a stunning world full of explorative opportunities and a humorous narrative that’ll have you chuckling once or twice. Just don’t let anyone know what the cause was. Puzzles are definitely a source of frustration, but if you can look past them, Immortals Fenyx Rising provides a formulaic but entertaining experience.",,,,,"Whether in its gameplay or its structure, Immortals Fenyx Rising will not surprise anyone who has touched a recent open world, that's for sure. Its borrowings from the last Zelda are numerous and glaring, but in the service of a pleasant adventure. Its open world is dense, well built and its scale makes it particularly pleasant to walk. Taking between 20 and 25 hours to see the end of it in a straight line, Immortals does good by providing a pressure-free experience. We will therefore easily recommend it to those who want to discover the game in the open world. Too bad its sometimes catastrophic storytelling interferes with the immersion.",,,"Immortals Fenyx Rising is a surprising break from the traditional Ubisoft open-world fare, perhaps hinting at some newfound creative freedoms that we’ll hopefully see play out in the future. Cribbing Breath of the Wild is a strength even as Immortals iterates and takes its own twist. And the deep dive into Greek mythology ends up being a fascinating foundation upon whose shoulders the entire premise rests. From the first magnificent glide onto the Golden Isle, Immortals Fenyx Rising is an unforgettable treat that surprised me more than I thought it would.",,,,"Immortals Fenyx Rising may not do much to push the open-world action adventure genre forward, but it does still ultimately succeed at being yet another competent release cut from the all too familiar Ubisoft cloth.","Immortals Fenyx Rising is a fun game that joyfully brings us into the Greek mythology, buts it also feels quite unpolished, with many aspects being either too familiar from Ubisoft games or just badly made.",,,,,,,"Immortals impressed me. It’s an unexpected success, blending comedy and condensed open-world gameplay into one of the most entertaining games I’ve played this year. Even if the combat lacks some variety and the main quests are a bit stale, the rest of Immortals is fantastic. It takes the modern open-world game and compresses it into something easier to enjoy, covering the whole thing in colorful art, great humor, and a ton of puzzles. If, over the years, you’ve found yourself getting bored of big open-world games that strive to look hyper-realistic and feature 200 hours of quests, Immortals might just be the perfect alternative.",,,,,,"Ubisoft has a knack for creating beautiful, expansive open worlds, but none of them are as compelling to explore as Immortals Fenyx Rising. It’s a sprawling, colorful playground with plenty of nooks and crannies to get lost in.",,"Immortals Fenyx Rising is an entertaining open-world title with tons of explorative depth, combative choice, and gorgeous visuals. The writing’s urgency to be as funny as possible is a bit of a turn-off, but beyond that, this is a standout adventure. While not a genre revolutionizer, Immortals Fenyx Rising plays to the genre’s strengths and can easily grant players dozens upon dozens of hours of great fun.",,,,"Ubisoft's open-world titles can invoke burnout towards their conclusion - crumbling under their own weight due to their size. Instead, this is a real palette cleanser. It feels like it hits that real sweet spot in the genre of the open-world adventure games. The world is large but enjoyable to explore, with just enough to do, and the constant commentary keeping things interesting. This combined with the genuinely funny and smart writing results in something that will be the big surprise hit for many.","Immortals Fenyx Rising is one of the best surprises of this year. After Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Ubisoft Quebec brings back greek mithology to start a new fresh and funny IP, full of puzzles, combat and hilarious storytelling.","Despite the obvious limits posed by its undoubtedly derivative nature, devoid of great originality and great qualitative ambitions, the final product works and entertains with an excellent balance between density and vastness.",Immortals Fenyx Rising has clear sources of 'inspiration' but also has a generally well crafted puzzle component that allows it to self itself apart from previous Ubisoft open world games.,,,"Immortals takes inspiration from many of its Ubisoft predecessors, as well as some other big titles, but it doesn’t really do a good enough job of differentiating itself. There’s no denying that there’s a great time to be had on the Golden Isle, just don’t go into it expecting anything genre-defining.",,,,,,"There are a lot of enjoyable aspects to Immortals Fenyx Rising, but very little feels new. Instead, it’s similar and safe, like I’ve done this all before. And I have but with a different main character and color palette. Its biggest sin is being entirely forgettable once you move on to the next game.",,,,,,,,,,,"Beautiful, content-rich and extremely elegant: This action adventure not only feels feels like Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but can almost equal its tremendous quality.",,,,,,,,,,,"Immortals: Fenyx Rising is much more than a simple Zelda: Breath of the Wild clone. Ubisoft's open-world epic adventure delivers a compelling and fun game that we hope will become a new, successful franchise.",,,,,"With a generic design and a bit of a bland start, Immortals: Fenyx Rising does not make a particularly great first impression. Less than an hour later our feelings are starting to turn - and after that the game just keeps giving. It is a joy to travel the colorful world and discover imaginative puzzles, tricky challenges, and fun battles. Sure, the adventure is a bit unfocused and somewhat generic, but when the gameplay delivers so much joy, it does not matter much.",,,,"Immortals Fenyx Rising lays a solid foundation for a new open world game by drawing inspiration from other successful contemporaries. It boasts an impressive combat system, but the limited enemy roster fails to showcase its true potential. Yet there’s so much to do and see, with numerous opportunities that highlight the amazing puzzle designs and the enormous scale of the world to explore, all set to a wonderful soundtrack composed by Gareth Coker. For those looking for a more stylized open world experience that doesn’t strive for realism, but rather revels in its mythology, Immortals is your type of odyssey.",,,,"Immortals Fenyx Rising is far from perfect--but it is good. It stumbles frequently as it explores Greek myths through a new lens, its best features are borrowed, and for as large and fun as its world is, it always feels like you're on a guided tour instead of really exploring it. But even as it lives in the shadow of better games, its puzzles, combat, and open-world loop come together often enough for me to not only see it through for a few dozen hours, but also want to keep filling out its almighty checklist, even if it lead me by the nose most of the way through.",,,,,"An epic open-world Action RPG with a tonne of content and genuinely enjoyable exploration makes for a great new IP. There are a few niggles with controls and loading times, and it’s not always clear what you need to do, but when the game is this much fun, I’m happy to overlook those.",,Immortals Fenyx Rising merges the best and worst of Ubisoft games with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.,,,,,,,,,,"Immortals has heart and when it comes together it can soar. But those wings are waxy and the sun is hot – tinkering is needed before it properly takes flight. [Issue#183, p.60]",,,,"Immortals Fenyx Rising was a game that I wanted to play to finish and put to the side, but it’s one that has stuck with me a lot longer than I thought it would, and given me one of my favourite Ubisoft open worlds in memory. If you can look beyond a lack of originality in some of its formula and some rigid puzzles, you’ll find a beautiful world that’s well worth exploring.","The world of Immortals: Fenyx Rising features plenty of things to keep you occupied as you rescue the gods and goddess of Mount Olympus. It’s not an especially deep game and after the first hour, you’ll have a pretty good idea of what to expect from the rest of the adventure. Breath of the Wild was fascinating because it left the player to figure things out on their own through experimentation. Immortals, on the other hand, can’t wait to show you everything it has to offer and will take the time to do so. And just when I started to feel weary and slipping into disinterest, I’d stumble onto a really fun Vault of Tartaros that served as a reminder that it’s the game’s inventive puzzles—not the boss fights, the witty commentary between Zeus and Prometheus, or the moving confessions of the gods—that make Immortals: Fenyx Rising a surprisingly delightful epic.",,"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Breath of the Wild set the bar for the genre, and since Link never got around to visiting Ancient Greece – there’s no shame in sending Fenyx there instead. [Issue#251, p.56]",,,,,,,,,,"Immortals Fenyx Rising is a charming and fun adventure into Greek mythology with Ubisoft's trademark core design elements thrown in to support the experience. It is a worthwhile adventure for those looking to scratch that Breath of the Wild itch, but one that experienced Ubisoft fans may feel is a little too familiar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sniper-elite-5,,,,,,,"There is no denying that Sniper Elite 5 is the best game yet by Rebellion and the most complete entry in the series, but could it take the franchise to the next level and transform it from a mediocre experience to a top of the bar shooter? The answer is probably no.",,,"With the fifth edition of SE, Rebellion makes a few steps forward, as well as a few steps back, due to its great focus on sandbox level design, riddled with problems with arena-like level segments, and bad implementation of Invasion mode with weird design choices when the UI is in question.",,,"Sniper Elite 5 is the series at its strongest to date. It's not a radical paradigm shift by any stretch of the imagination, but it doesn't need to be. Instead, it builds on what Sniper Elite 4 did so well by expanding on the scale of maps, stuffs them full of things to do, and polishes its already-compelling combat. If you're looking for a tactical, rewarding World War II-era shooter, Sniper Elite 5 comes highly recommended.",,,,,,,,,"If you’ve played previous Sniper Elite games, you already know if you’re going to like Sniper Elite 5. If you haven’t, I can’t recommend it enough, as well as the previous entries. The quality is consistent all the way back to the first entry, and it’s a ton of fun. Don’t forget to check out the Nazi Zombie Army games as well. As I mentioned at the beginning of the review, Rebellion knows the meaning of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”, and they’ve used that to pump out a series of great games.","Despite the minor issues and that odd design choice, Sniper Elite 5 is a fun game for newcomers to the series and longtime fans. It caters to a wide variety of gamers, providing both easy and difficult challenges that anyone can set up and then overcome in their own way. Overall, it's a high-quality game that further improves the stellar legacy of the entire series.","In sum, Sniper Elite 5 is another evolution in the right direction of this long-running series. If you enjoyed any of the previous entries, this one should be right up your ally and I would lean towards calling it the best yet. The additions of more traversal mechanics, the workbenches, and Invasion mode, along with even bigger maps (that are also the best looking/designed yet) make this an all-around compelling game. However, some age-old issues still rear their head at times, including some jankiness with AI, bugs, and invisible walls. Some of these are likely to be patched out, and frequent auto-saves also help work-around these issues.","Sniper Elite 5 is a great little shooter, and I had a lot of fun sinking into its sprawling levels and inventive mechanics. It doesn’t change the formula or even introduce anything particularly new to the wider genre, but perfectly understands what it wants to be and delivers on that expectation with significant flair. I viewed it as a palette cleanser of sorts, an experience that harkens back to a different generation of single-player shooters we don’t tend to see anymore. It’s almost nostalgic, and aside from Wolfenstein there is no better Nazi-murdering simulator out there.",Sniper Elite 5 is the best it's ever been with a new game mode that'll blow your mind.,,"Sniper Elite 5 is a truly enjoyable tactical action game. Sniping Nazis never gets old, and Rebellion has provided a brilliant platform to one again partake in one of video gaming's oldest pastimes.",,,,,,"If you’re wondering if it’s worth picking up, I guess I’d say that it probably is. If you’ve never played a Sniper Elite game before, Sniper Elite 5 is as good as any to jump in with. You don’t need previous experience to understand what’s going on. If you’ve played every game in the series, then you know if you’re going to like this one. However, if you bounced off the previous titles, this one absolutely isn’t going to change your mind. Not in the same way a bullet to a Nazi’s cerebral cortex does.","While Sniper Elite 5 introduces a generous amount of game mechanics that are new to the series, they aren’t especially unique when looking at the shooter genre at large. Sure, it’s good that Sniper Elite is now catching up, but it’s still got a ways to go. With that said, it’s a marked improvement over Sniper Elite 4 and fans of the franchise will no doubt find a lot to like here. It’s also on Xbox Game Pass and will be a fine addition to the line-up during a tumultuous time for the service. [Review in Progress]",,"Sniper Elite 5 is a bad game, in part thanks to boring maps, lackluster graphics and a non-existent story, but most of all because of its fundamentally flawed AI that takes all the fun out of stealth and sniping.","Sniper Elite 5 is exactly what I want from the series: new maps, new Nazis, and new ways to kill them. The only real let down is that the graphics have not evolved evolved from the last couple of iterations. The levels look great and are fun to explore, they just don’t have a next generation feel. That said, this game is an absolute blast. The time I’ve spent stalking Nazis in the French countryside has been quite enjoyable. The additions and tweaks between this and the last game add to the experience instead of detracting or distracting. I can’t wait to get back into France and kill some more Nazis with my friends.",,"While Sniper Elite 5‘s campaign feels a little familiar, and largely more focused on sneaking than sniping, we can’t help but be impressed by the overall package. With co-op, competitive multiplayer modes and a new invasion mechanic, Sniper Elite 5 has something for everybody. And a range of difficulty settings make it suitable for all skill levels. So, unless you go into it expecting to snipe everything that moves, chances are you won’t be disappointed.",,"Sniper Elite 5 introduces some decent additions to the tried-and-tested formula and impressively improves on the X-ray killcams that the series is famous for. In spite of that, Sniper Elite needs an overhaul into next-gen to really keep the franchise alive in the future.","Sniper Elite 5 is the best the series has been, with layered combat, huge maps, and tons of options to get that all-important kill.",,,"The new setting in France, Fairburne´s new abilities and new game modes, such as Invasion make Sniper Elite 5 the best in the series. A classic stealth game, that excels every time we take a long shot and enjoy the ""killcam"".","Sniper Elite 5 let me down. I expected the next generation of this franchise. Instead, we got Sniper Elite 4.5. If Rebellion Developments hopes to continue this series down the line, they’ll need to return to the drawing board and bring something fresh next time.",,"Sniper Elite 5 does everything the previous installations did, except it does them better, in new and updated graphics. What are you waiting for? Get sniping!",,,,,,,,,"Sniper Elite 5 is undeniably a better game than its predecessors. Every level is packed modestly with things to do, and the kills are endlessly enjoyable. But some antiquated design choices, a done-to-death setting, and a ho-hum story keep it from reaching its full potential. It’s a shame too, because at its core Sniper Elite 5 is one of the best Sniper experiences you can play right now, it’s just everything else that’s letting it down.","It’s easy to get lost exploring the giant maps in Rebellion’s Sniper Elite 5, and it’s been a while since I’ve played a game where I lost track of time. The collecting part leaves something to be desired, but the co-op and invasion gameplay modes more than make up for that.",,,"Sniper Elite 5 is the best one yet. It still has some technical issues, like the messy AI and it can be hard sometimes, but it’s still a lot of fun and probably enough to make both hardcore fans and newcomers happy. It’s a blast.",,"Despite coming with its very own set of cons, Sniper Elite 5 is still brilliantly glorious. It’s indeed repetitive if you want to always take the fastest route to complete a mission, but at the end of the day, the more time you spend doing everything right, the more Sniper Elite impresses. Rebellion has clearly improved the parts that fans have been asking for, so you’re getting not only larger maps, but also more varied levels, better equipment, more troops, more vehicles, more weapon customization options, and so on. The new invasion mode also makes missions more challenging by allowing human players to enter your game and take the role of an Axis sniper, though you can obviously disable this mode if you just want to stick with single-player action. So overall, Sniper Elite 5 has a little bit of everything, eventually creating one of the most solid gameplays of the year so far.",,"Despite feeling familiar, there are plenty of improvements here that make the feel more dynamic and challenging at the same time. Sniper Elite 5 gives you the tools for you to make tactical decisions and offers you a generous amount of freedom to make mistakes and take the approach you want when completing missions.","The latest installment in the franchise builds on what we already know and, unfortunately, the AI is still not at its optimal level. Also, the skills are largely irrelevant, so the developer has dropped some stitches. But do not let that stop you, because the gameplay itself is very solid. The strong level design makes you enjoy going through the adventure and the sniping itself is a pleasure to experience time after time. In other words, a more than fine sequel in the popular series.",,"Sniper Elite 5 knows exactly who it’s aimed at, and Rebellion is on target as always. The developer’s dense French sandboxes are hugely replayable, and look fantastic to boot. There are some sloppy gameplay mechanics, like the climbing and twitchy camera, but these are easy to forgive. A wide array of difficulty options mean both super-agents and rookies can eke something out of this title, and with the release accommodating so many different play styles, it represents a real bullet to our heart – or should that be balls? [Review in Progress]",,"Bigger maps, more ways to slaughter Nazis, more weapon attachments and more freedom - there’s simply more of everything in Sniper Elite 5. It also pioneers the new and brilliant Invasion system which will turn your game into a gripping sniper duel. This is the best instalment of the series, combining stealth from Metal Gear Solid, open locations from Hitman and invasions from Dark Souls.","Unfortunately, Sniper Elite 5 isn't the best entry in the series; that remains number 4. This is an extremely solid sniper simulation that will keep both fans and newcomers busy for weeks.","More highly addictive Nazi cranium popping, that improves almost every aspect of the experience – especially in terms of the open world and expanded weapon options.","Although technically dated, the game offers a neat aesthetic and is based on French landscapes (including the very vertical Mont Saint Michel) which will have a particular resonance with the inhabitants of France.",,,"Sniper Elite 5 makes small attempts at innovation but not enough to stop it from being a fairly safe entrant into the Sniper Elite franchise. The enhanced killcam, extensive weapon customization, and better skill trees help to improve the experience over Sniper Elite 4. Players will undoubtedly have fun roaming the large battlefields of France as long as they can get over the minor bugs, although we could do without those that can stop a playthrough in its tracks. While the standard multiplayer modes and Survival mode will keep players occupied for a while, Invasion mode is what will keep players coming back for more.","When Sniper Elite 5 hits right, it's every bit the long-range murder simulator sandbox we wanted. When you're completely in the zone, balancing stealth and precision and executing your plan of attack with utmost excellence, there are few games like it. Sadly, minor issues mount up and can harm your experience and tarnish some of what it does so well. Still, with a refined template, it feels Rebellion is on the verge of a bullseye here.",Quotation forthcoming.,,,"Faithful to the series, in its qualities as in its defaults, this new episode of Sniper Elite 5 hardly surprises. The faithful who were waiting for the full of innovations or a huge technical leap will therefore be at their expense. But this status quo also has its advantages. It is the guarantee of highly pleasing kill cams, an open and proven level design, numerous infiltration mechanics and, above all, fun and realistic sniping gameplay.","Sniper Elite 5 features the same great stealth combat that fans of the series have come to adore, even if its story and all guns blazing approach leave a lot to be desired. A few new upgrades like Axis Invasion mode and enhanced weapon customisation are welcome additions, making killing Nazis still damn fun.","Bigger than ever, Sniper Elite 5 is a refreshingly direct and enjoyable stealth shooter with a multiplayer mode that elevates it to new heights. [Issue#16, p.126]",,,,,,,,"While a few issues remain that hamper the experience, it’s a no-brainer to proclaim Sniper Elite 5 has taken everything that made 4 as great as it was and improved it.",,"This is exactly what fans of the series wanted: more and better Sniper Elite 5. It’s not a revolution, but still knows how to make the formula enjoyable.","The wheel isn’t being reinvented for stealth shooters in the case of this game, but it is a thoughtful infusion of elements and ideas from several genre-defining franchises. The result is a cocktail that’s fun, so long as it works.","With a new WW2 tale to tell and Axis plot to foil, Sniper Elite 5 expands and refines a lot of the action that will be familiar to fans of Sniper Elite 4. There's a few rough edges, but this is a fun stealth action romp for Karl Fairburne.",,,,Sniper Elite 5 is unmissable for anyone with even a passing interest in stealth games.,,"Sniper Elite 5 probably stands as the best episode of the Rebellion series, but five years after the previous chapter we expected more substantial improvements compared to a couple of ziplines, climbing vines, active reload and some upgradable skills. The core gameplay still works, but suffers from the same old problems when it comes to short-ranged fights and the movements and interactions of the characters feel really cumbersome.","Even with a few too many technical defects, Sniper Elite 5 continues to be an enjoyable and fun game, just like the chapters that preceded it. Thanks to spectacular X-Ray kills, maps designed to be played multiple times, immediate gameplay and many different modes such as co-op and invasions, the Rebellion title can keep the player busy well over the ten hours required for the solo. completion of the campaign. Furthermore, we cannot ignore the addition of Sniper Elite 5 on Xbox and PC Game Pass at launch, a factor that will help to populate the servers and, due to cross-play, will allow you to find new companions or opponents to challenge without particular problems.","Everyone who loved the previous entry, will surely enjoy this one, that lacks real improvements and innovations.","Sniper Elite 5 does what the series does best: letting you kill Nazis with unrelenting fury. You can be as strategic or guns-blazing as you’d like, and the number of options will have players coming back for more quite often.",,,,,,,,,,"An action hero for the ages, Karl Fairburn takes you trough a bullet-ridden, high-stakes, action-packed blockbuster thrill ride. Sniper Elite 5 is the epitome of what it means to marry tactical shooters and stealth action games.","Sniper Elite 5 has a few weaknesses like the cliche story, the frumpy graphics and some bugs.

Making tremendous strides in both technology and visuals, Sniper Elite 5 can stand amongst the likes of its AAA contemporaries with gorgeous, realistic environments and visuals. Character modelling and animation could still use some refinement and the narrative left something to be desired, though the story thread was enough to provide adequate pacing for the action on screen.

It doesn't reinvent the wheel for this niche genre, nor does it have to. All that Sniper Elite 5 had to do was recapture the formula of Sniper Elite 4 along with some refinements and that is precisely what it does. Sure, the AI could be better and the repetition does slow things down somewhat. However, who really cares about any of that when you can blow off a Nazi's testicles in a glorious high definition x-ray kill-cam?

Its tense sniping action and massive sandboxes are best in class for the series, allowing for creativity and player agency in a way that so few action games do. If you can overlook a narrative that suffers from fatigue due to its subject matter and the somewhat clumsy way in which Karl interacts with his surroundings, then Sniper Elite 5 and its open-ended approach to gameplay provide a stunning, experimental sandbox that you will likely find yourself returning to again and again.",,,,,"Our favorite sniper comes back with a great and renewed formula.

Splashteam has absolutely blown it out of the teeny, tiny park, and we’d love more adventures with Milo in the future.",,,,,,,"Tinykin is a joyous trek through the 90s. Full of charm and wonder, the game manages to add to the foundation laid by Pikmin to build a lovely adventure. Every area has lots to find and do which fleshes out the relatively short runtime.

Due to this, you can’t help but smile during the entirety of the game and will enjoy each second.",,,,,,,"Gathering up the Tinykin to get Milo home is great fun.

It can be punishing at times, perhaps overly so, but it’s hard not to be impressed by the game’s authenticity. Racing through stages is always exhilarating, thanks largely to the impressive visuals and reliable physics model. And whether you want to sink your teeth into a meaty career or dive in for a quick challenge, there’s a mode for you. There’s still a little room for improvement, but WRC 10 is undoubtedly the best rally game you can buy right now.",,,,,,,"WRC 10 isn’t going to be for everybody, but I think the ones that love it will really love it.

One minute, it’s frustrating the hell out of you; the next, you’re pumping your fist in the air over the milliseconds you were able to shave off a run. And that’s what racing is all about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WRC 10 builds on the success of its predecessor with another impressive rally sim. The handling feels excellent on the track, and speeding through all the official routes is a real thrill.

We take real pleasure in terms of racing sensations and a total change of scenery on some specials, despite the recurring lack of staging and some technical flaws (tearing, cliping ...).

In your early hours, you’ll feel overwhelmed by the game’s lack of aid, and you’ll definitely need to check a YouTube tutorial or two to get going. It’s a more hardcore experience, that's for sure, but even then, its campaign mode pulls you too far away from the central experience. However, once you begin to familiarize yourself with the racer, it offers up an addictive and brutal experience that’ll have you memorizing corners like never before. And there is something here for even those who often dabble in more casual racing games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WRC 10 is another solid entry in the long-running series. This year’s a special one for WRC fans thanks to the 50th-anniversary content which is its own game mode.

Since both franchises are played differently it’s difficult to merge the two into one experience, but how they did it here works great and it’s easy to jump into and play. There is enough offered in Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 that even if you are a fan of just one type of puzzler you will probably still find something to like.

The competitive mode is the highlight of the release and gives you plenty of reasons to keep playing this sequel.,,"There's more than enough in the game's Adventure mode to recommend Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 to the dedicated and the curious. While this falls firmly on the side of evolution, Skill Battles are a strong new addition to the game's lineup of modes, while the rat-a-tat joke delivery of the story adds a flavour that you just don't get in other puzzle games. This inexplicable cocktail remains potent for any puzzle lover.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 is essentially a carbon copy of the first game except it has a new mode and a different story-based adventure.

wavetale,,,,,,,,"Wavetale certainly could've used some extra polish but the movement and storytelling shine strongly in a world that is mostly gorgeous to look at. Combat lacks any threat and the platforming can feel incredibly simple. There's not a lot of risks being taken which can result in a game that feels trivial. Despite this, there's more than enough to keep those curious onboard.

You can easily fly up buildings in style due to the responsive controls. Even though the objectives are similar throughout, the areas are well-designed to make each island refreshing. While you can overlook the lackluster and rigid combat, the performance issues are harder to ignore. Screen tearing and pop-ins are frequent and hinder the experience. However, fans of games like Solar Ash and The Pathless will still enjoy the game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm thoroughly impressed with Wavetale as it completely surpassed my expectations by being one of the most beautifully captivating indies that I've ever played.

For starters, fixing the music issues and the freezes would be mandatory in order to prevent discouraging people from trying it. For what is worth, Wavetale does a single thing well and that's the sliding mechanic, which is probably the only true selling point of the game. From the beginning to end, surfing the waves remains the main charm of Wavetale. It is a remarkable first effort, and one can only hope that it is enough to make people notice Wavetale and grant the developers the chance to make a sequel building upon the existing formula.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What's wrong? It’s simple. Some elements (pursuit, stealth moments, exploration) are far from perfect and, considering the price, it was reasonable to expect something more contents.

Of course, I would love nothing more than to see both Yagami and Kaito back as the main focuses in a future installment of Judgment, but if the Judgment series has to go on somehow without Yagami, I think The Kaito Files demonstrates that Kaito can muster up the strength to take over as the main character, despite how divisive it would be.",,,,,,,"Lost Judgment was a superlative experience, and The Kaito Files DLC proves that Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's future is in good hands. While this DLC should've been cheaper on its own, combined with the other content in the Season Pass, it is well worth grabbing for any fan of Judgment and its characters. I hope we don't have to wait too long for another Judgment game and would love to see a full game with Kaito as the lead.",,"Taken as a complete package, Lost Judgment and The Kaito Files serves as one of the best story offerings I can think of in recent memory. With as fantastic as the former’s story was, I’m overjoyed that the story in the latter at least maintains (and often exceeds) the standard we’ve come to expect from Ryu Ga Gotoku. While the somewhat steep price tag might be a bit high for DLC, the densely packed narrative and trademark gameplay helps take the edge off. It proves that Kaito is more than capable of carrying a story, and I can’t wait to see what his future holds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It takes a bit of improvement and a lot to pay for it.","There’s not much to like about a business model so brazenly designed to divorce kids from their pocket money – and the big swing in favour of untradeable reward cards this year only increases the likelihood of that outcome. That said… it is remarkably addictive, and the overhaul of the chemistry rules that underpin squad building have at least shaken up the shakedown.",,"One of sports gaming’s longest partnerships ends with a shrug of the shoulders. FIFA 23, positively and negatively, doesn’t feel like the end of an era. That’s mostly because it’s hard to see EA revolutionizing the underlying formula after the FIFA license has departed. All in all, FIFA 23 is a solid football spectacle with the same old woes.","FIFA 23 is easily one of the best football games EA has released in a long time, but meaningful new mechanics and fantastic new features are still overshadowed by a mode that’s a pay-to-win system in everything but name.",Hypermotion system keeps elevating Fifa to a whole new standard compared to how it felt before. We truly feel that Fifa 23 is the best and most complete soccer game ever made.,"FIFA 23 represents the evolution of a path that began with FIFA 22, that of the implementation of the new Hypermotion 2 technology, an addition that serves the title to modify the rhythm of the matches, moderately improving what has been exposed so far. It is not a revolution, but it ends up bringing more novelties than its predecessor.","All good things come to an end, and so does FIFA. Not that the game itself will cease to exist, but from next year it will simply be called EA Sports FC. In any case, the latest edition in the series could not be more FIFA: the moments on the pitch are great, those off it a little less so. There are times when it seems mostly a commercial for itself. The menus are garish and lead you everywhere but where you want to go. They also make it clear where Electronic Arts wants players to spend the most time: in flagship/milk cow Ultimate Team, where you build the strongest team possible and compete with it online. But once you get busy you notice how Electronic Arts manages to make soccer just that little bit more appealing every year.","FIFA 23 it's a solid game full of modes and great gameplay, but less ambitious than expected for the last of its name.",,"It’s a huge gaming bundle and everything you want from a football game. Fans will be sad to see this console icon go, but with a new look next year there is the potential for EA to freshen things up and deliver something even better.",,,,,"FIFA 23 is the same as it has always been, maybe for the last time.",EA and FIFA part company with a game packing fresh content both on and off the park – but FIFA 23 is ultimately hamstrung by a pair of longstanding frustrations.,,"So far, it's looking good with FIFA 23. However, it will take a while for the dust to settle with these changes to find out exactly how successful they are, particularly due to the community focus of the game and how those multiplayer components interact, as well as the depth that is found in game modes over time. It takes some time for tweaks in a game like FIFA 23 to find their feet - and for their successes and failures to really be realized. [Review in Progress]",,,"The gameplay of FIFA 23 has changed to give us a slower gameplay, where the player's movement is more important and takes away weight from the use of skills. In addition, the chemistry of Ultimate Team will allow you to create more and more varied teams than ever before. So FIFA 23 manages to be a motivating product for those of us who are addicted to Ultimate Team and at the same time knows how to provide enough novelties in other game modes for those who enjoy the global game much more.","FIFA 23 is a worthy farewell to the series’ current name. The HyperMotion2 technology makes gameplay more realistic and simply better, while the changes to Ultimate Team’s squad chemistry system are a step in the right direction. However, it’s a shame that single-player modes were neglected once again.",,,,,"FIFA 23 had been a much better game if you could leave out everything outside of the matches. Ultimate Team has become too much of a focus, while the minute to minute gameplay still works.",,,"While not a revolution, EA hasn’t rested on its laurels when it comes to FIFA 23. From meaningful tweaks and additions to modes, to a noticeably improved on-pitch experience, it’s simply bigger and better than its predecessors in every single way. And so the FIFA series, at least with EA at the helm, is going out with a bang rather than a whimper. But if EA Sports FC is to truly impress, it’s going to have to deliver something fresh.","So is it worth it this year? That's a firm ""yes"". The Hypermotion 2 engine lives up to its hype and delivers what it probably the best simulation of football I've seen. You have a variety of game modes to find your favorites with some like Volta that deliberately speed up the pace that the engine tends to slow down in Career. You also have the widest variety of stars to choose from featuring men's and women's teams as well as all the licenses and real player likenesses you can hope for. However, Career mode needs some love. And by love I don't mean more meaningless transfer cutscenes. I mean depth beyond just the UK pyramid: add some real lower division teams across leagues and stop neglecting everything outside of Europe.",,"Outside of the lengthy modes discussed, it's just what you want out of a football game: a damn good game of footy. I don’t care what they call it next year, if it improves on this then I will be there on day one.","Now it feels like the physics, AI and animation have come together in a way that makes even these ridiculous moments feel naturalistic and pleasurable. The first Fifa on the Mega Drive billed itself as an authentic experience of real sport, real drama, real spectacle. It wasn’t then, but perhaps, in this final iteration … it is now.","FIFA 23 is trying to give new footballing experiences to players, but falls short on many levels. Graphically the game is extremely impressive and the new match day experiences add a new sensation when stepping on the pitch. However, the problems of old, like janky animations and general slowness, are still present in the gameplay and keep frustration alive. All these things make FIFA 23 a mixed bag of awe and annoyances.","FIFA 23 complies, but does not abandon the path of continuity. EA Sports bids farewell to its legendary license with interesting gameplay tweaks that will have their defenders and detractors, as always. FIFA 23 looks a little better, as always. FIFA 23 maintains what sells, as always; and FIFA 23 brings us quality and fun soccer, as always.","FIFA 23 is the perfect end to the franchise. The addition of the PowerShot opens up new ways to score and the overhaul of the chemistry system allows you to add more variety to your team sheet in FUT. While the game doesn’t drastically change the formula, it evolves on its already strong foundation to create the most immersive experience to date.","FIFA 23 is the best experience that Electronic Arts has created on the playing fields, but it suffers from exactly the same as always in terms of systems and monetization. It is one of those games in which we must be very clear about what it is going to offer us and know how to live with it.","The simple question: for owners of FIFA 22 on next-gen consoles, is it worth purchasing FIFA 23? The answer is a definitive ‘yes.’ While not a perfect upgrade, it’s a noticeable one that takes many big steps in the right direction. Plus, if you’re even a mild fan of women’s football and/or Ted Lasso, this decision is a whole lot easier, in tandem.","FIFA 23 keeps the series tradition, with extremely fun gameplay, good improvements in comparison to last year, beautiful graphics and rich game modes that will keep you entertained for hours and hours. It may not the most accurate football simulator on the market, but it is so far ahead its competition that, if you are a soccer fan, this is the game for you.",,,"FIFA 23 shows that EA still knows how to make a good football game that should please the fans. It may not be a perfect goodbye to the series - gameplay has its issues and the game's strong ""TikTok vibe"" can worry a bit, but there's no denying that it definitely is a good game.",,,"Fifa 23 will go down in history as the last Fifa, but definitely not the best. The culmination of 30 years of soccer history doesn't lead to a satisfying climax in the franchise, mainly due to modern improvements are held back by a dilapitaded foundation. However, there is no shortage of content but with such a high goal inflation, you could wonder what that's worth anymore.",,"This year's FIFA is a comprehensive package for football fans thanks to HyperMotion 2, big reworks to FIFA Ultimate Team and the introduction of the FA Women’s Super League and the French Division 1 Feminine.",,"FIFA 23 is a very good soccer game, that comes along without highlight and partly half-baked in the implementation of new features.",,"FIFA 23 is a farewell letter to millions of football fans around the world. With amazing visuals and an improved gameplay, the last entry of the FIFA series delivers a well rounded experience. It ain’t perfect, and maybe not the most entertaining, but it’s as close as real life soccer that FIFA has ever been in 30 years of history.",,"At the end of the day, FIFA 23 is a release that’ll probably keep many players on board next year when EA Sports FC will be thrown into the battle for the very first time. It’s a major release in pretty much every regard, and while some things are missing, such as VAR and the support for only three substitutions, this is by far the best FIFA. Ever.","EA Sports truly gave us a different game from FIFA 22 and at last we feel that we are entering a new era. A final instalment with FIFA that will convince you no matter which game mode you choose. EA Sports reinvented FUT such as the career mode and gave the player a whole new aspect to the game. FIFA 23 keeps its promises and in short, EA Sports has mastered its subject on almost every point.",,"With FIFA 23, EA takes another step forward when it comes to gameplay with the necessary relatively subtle improvements and innovations. FUT Moments is an excellent addition and the visual quality is outstanding. At the same time, there isn’t a lot of real innovation and the game still has its share of issues and bugs, which can interfere with gameplay. Basically a good football game, but EA still has some polishing to do.",,"The tweaks to FIFA 23’s gameplay make for a more deliberate, physical representation of the beautiful game – and while it won’t be to the taste of sweats who are used to five-star skilling their way up the ranks in Division Rivals, personally we appreciate the commitment to authenticity. As an overall package, this is a strong end to an impressive 30-year run, but an overemphasis on microtransactions and some cumbersome UI decisions underline everything that’s been frustrating about this franchise for the past decade or so. Make no mistake, with crossplay and a wealth of things to do, this is the best shape the series has been in – but we hope EA Sports FC, unshackled from the overbearing eyes of governing body FIFA, brings a little bit more to the field.","The reality is that FIFA 23 presents enough changes at the game mechanics level to make the experience feel fresh and entertaining. The game modes didn't receive noticeable improvements or adjustments, but that doesn't make the game terrible or unplayable. This installment of FIFA changes the gameplay experience, which is the most important thing because it does not happen every four years. If you are a fan of the series, this is the installment you were waiting for to feel that real change.","A few nice improvements cannot hide the fact that FIFA needs proper innovations really badly. The Ultimate Team works well, in no small part thanks to the new Chemistry system, but the Career mode is literally dead and buried. I’ll be expecting much more from the future EA Sports FC.","FIFA 23 is starting to look like football again. It is actually too bizarre for words that this is a plus for a footie, but the series is coming out of a deep valley. Hopefully EA will continue on this foot from next year without the yoke of the FIFA name (and costs!) ...","A disappointing final whistle from EA as the new mechanics and fine-tuning create little in the way of major change, for a series that has long been in need of a major revamp.","While FIFA 23's new set piece and power kick system won't appeal to everyone, version 2 of the Hypermotion engine does wonders for player animations and rendering. On the other hand, this opus improves the career mode in a beautiful way, especially when one embodies a player and tries to dust off FIFA Ultimate Team thanks to “Moments” and a new way of thinking about the collective. Something to shake up the regulars a bit. In short, if it does not revolutionize its formula, this FIFA 23 is one of the most complete in the saga before moving to EA Sports FC.","FIFA 23 is the best feeling football game currently on the market, the gameplay is much better this time around than it was in FIFA 22. It's just a shame the lack of attention to the single player game modes, and Pro Clubs, lets the rest of the game down.",,,,,"FIFA 23 is a solid outing fort he series, even though it lacks the really groundbreaking innovations. Best new feature is Hypermotion-2-Technolgoy, that give the on-pitch-gameplay a new spin. However, there are still a lot of old flaws, that EA Sports has to target over the next years.","FIFA 23 is the final entry of this footballing franchise under its current iconic name, and it's not really one to remember. While the gameplay continues to strive forward, most of the other new features are rather undercooked and the overall package lacks a bit of polish.","Reviewing a FIFA game is always a complicated exercise, the game has the habit of changing its gameplay with each new episode. At the time of this test, FIFA 23 gives us an enjoyable gaming experience. The new version of HyperMotion is a hit and this FIFA 23 is one of the best opuses of recent years.",,"On the pitch, this is most cerebral FIFA outing since the its PS5 debut. Off it, even the non-FUT modes feel like they’ve been shown some pre-season TLC. [Issue#20, p.72]","FIFA 23 it's huge and has a place for every football fan. However, not as great as the legendary editions of the football simulator.",,,,,,"The gameplay changes, which are the most meaningful improvements among FIFA 23’s additions because they serve all modes of play, don’t just give me more things to do, or moves to memorize on my gamepad. By opening up new ways to exploit my team’s strengths, they actually tell me I’m better at soccer — video game soccer — than I give myself credit for. Of all the things I noticed in FIFA 23 right out of the box, that might have come last. But it mattered the most.","What makes FIFA 23 so great is the product on the field, but the lack of change in the locker room brings it down a notch.",,"FIFA 23, as a standalone game, is great, but as a sequel doesn’t really offer any big features to justify this year’s entry.",,"FIFA 23 is the most expansive game in the series' long history; women's football has never been better represented, there's fun new activities like Volta Arcade, and there's still all of the classic modes. Still where FIFA 23 takes steps forward in some areas, it could still be better in others. The action on the pitch is fun and engaging, but the user interface can be clunky, and modes like player career mode feels like an afterthought with largely superficial changes, compared to the investment in Ultimate Team. FIFA 23 is the end of an era and goes out on a high, but still has the hallmarks of the series' gradual yearly evolution.",,"Even though it has not gained a qualitative leap, FIFA 23 has done the best possible within the frame where it belongs. Engine changes and the addition of new actions have added a lot of fresh ideas to the basic gameplay. Several changes to the career mode have given the single-player experience many improvements. The FUT mode provides more benefits to players. Unfortunately, the new system ""highlight"" is not as good as the experience.",,"The last game in the series to bear the FIFA name is a fittingly unambitious entry. It makes minor changes here and there, but there's not an awful lot to differentiate it from last year's offerings. Thankfully, the on-pitch action is still a hell of a lot of fun.",,,"FIFA greets its fans with an ambitious and rich chapter like never before, which manages to compensate for some historical mistakes with a convincing mix between a football with arcade nuances and simulation realism. Strengthened by an impressive and extremely varied content offer, we are sure that the community will be able to appreciate the many facets of this last episode, before the historic EA franchise changes its shirt becoming EA Sports FC. A formula that allows the production to bring home the result, for a farewell rich in content and effective on a playful level.",,,,,,"FIFA 23 keeps the high standards of the series in content, modes and visual display, closing one chapter and opening another for EA. However, it does not reinvent the wheel, it does not pioneer, it does not take risks, it does not bring something new or fresh. FIFA 23 simply executes, and scores in a match that will probably be quickly forgotten.","FIFA 23 is a modest final hurrah for one of the most iconic game series of all time. It feels like EA Sports is saving the big advances for its EA Sports FC replacement coming next year, with FIFA 23 only offering marginal flourishes of something great and a lot of repetition. On the pitch, the game of football is good – better in many ways than FIFA 22. Animations are smooth and varied, there’s more free-flowing action and more variety in player types. Yet, everything else feels half-baked. Career mode is, to put it mildly, awful and Ultimate Team remains a cash grab that’s only for those willing to put far too much into it. The commentary is equally terrible, and while the larger focus on the women’s game is great, it‘s too limited.","FIFA 23 tries new things and doesn't quite get them all right. It's not a bad game, but it's also not the best we've ever seen, not even close. It brings slower gameplay, a more patient passing game, but patches will surely change this over the coming months. Career Mode threatens to score a banger, but gets lost with repetitive cutscenes and some bizarre bugs in the Artificial Intelligence's behaviour. Ultimately, EA Sports and FIFA won't be saying goodbye with grand ceremonies, but rather with a timid exit from the pitch.","FIFA 23 is still utterly engrossing, wildly frustrating, uncannily realistic and very silly. It’s endlessly playable but, just like real football, the search for the perfect blueprint goes on.",,"FIFA 23 is a bombastic swan song for the series (under its current name, at least) with a welcome focus on theatrical flair. FUT Moments, action replays and viral-friendly gameplay revisions like Power Shots make it a more considered, memorable game of simulated football with intentional defending and plenty of drama and goals. But EA's Spartan approach to the modes that don't make money ensures FIFA 23 is an all-too-familiar beast to previous years, and Ultimate Team’s offensive focus on microtransactions continues to take much of the fun out of it.","This year FIFA brings bigger updates that many expected long before. However, as it is the final game in the series, there is still the feeling that something is missing, although without a doubt FIFA 23 is the best EA Sport's release in the last few years.",Quotation forthcoming.,,,,"At its core, FIFA 23 is a solid game that offers a whole lot to experience. Sure, some passes won’t go where you expect them to and yes, too many gameplay tweaks will inevitably unbalance things from time to time. Yet you’ll have plenty of opportunity to find the balance of your choosing—because at the end of the day, finding that perfect balance is a frivolous exercise. So experience it however you like doing so. Get out of it whatever you wish to get out of it, and look forward to what’s next.","More reliable passing, improved defending, and balanced attacking options mean FIFA 23 is a lot of fun to play. It’s an improved overall package, even if FUT’s main additions are underwhelming and the other modes have been given little love once again.",,,,"Despite quite a lot of changes, FIFA23 somehow feels much the same to its previous title. However, As the final title that uses the name of FIFA, the game seems like a stepping stone, preparing for the next bright future. By the way, training center for those who are not used to this genre was quite impressive.",FIFA 23 is the sum of all the previous games with a balanced mix of features and improvements that make it the best soccer simulator of all time. HyperMotion2 is the technology that the game needed even though the bad statistics of some players give us a hard time.,,,"FIFA 23 is the perfect goodbye party for the EA Sports franchise. HyperMotion 2.0 is brilliant in portraying intensity, dynamism and hi-tense rhythm football. The gameplay is hectic and engaging, even though quite unbalanced in terms of offensive/defensive action and the goalkeepers AI is quite questionable. If you like offensive football and epic individual duels, FIFA 23 will provide hours of fun both in single and multiplayer, while the ""new"" Ultimate Teams works great.","EA Sports is preparing its transition in the best possible way by dusting off old systems that are still well established while integrating into its simulation elements that are now essential for a game of this scale and with such a large audience...This year, FIFA 23 is a Next-Gen game with its Hypermotion technology, and we sincerely hope that it will not be changed in the next few weeks, because as it is, it is the best FIFA since the 17th.",,,,,"Electronic Arts says goodbye to the FIFA brand with an edition that is not perfect, but still deserves a wide promotion. HyperMotion 2 is excellent, and the gameplay offers slightly slower matches than in the past, with less dribbling and more maneuvering. There is still room for improvement, and some aspects (for example, the goalkeepers) need an adjustment via patch, but overall the game flows in a pleasant and fun way. Good, without major upheavals, the game modes, which traditionally offers a range of variants that can satisfy anyone, starting from those who want to enjoy a quick go to those who want to manage an entire team.",,,,,,,,"FIFA 23 misses the mark. The whole game is based on its fast pace and depth, but the collisions are still failing and infuriating. The addition of the heavy shot leaves us fearing the worst. That said, the game is very beautiful on Next Gen and the content remains enormous and will keep you busy all season, for lack of anything better.",,,,"FIFA 23 signs off on EA and FIFA’s partnership with another solid entry that brings the gameplay experience closer to the real thing, but it’s once again sullied by its Ultimate Team monetisation.","FIFA 23 is a fitting end to an era, successfully capturing the essence of the beautiful game alongside the disheartening practices of the profit-hungry vultures circling overhead. It's as much about greed as it is about scoring a screamer. A game where the on-pitch action has been refined with slicker passing, more effective defending, and myriad animations that bring it all to life, yet the shadow of gambling looms over it all. This has been the case since Ultimate Team was introduced 14 years ago, so none of this comes as a surprise. And with the next World Cup taking place in Qatar--a country known for sports washing its human rights record--it's all par for the course when it comes to football. The age of FIFA might be coming to an end, but EA Sports FC is likely to kick off in much the same way: offering a fantastic game of football that's otherwise consumed by an exploitative cash grab.",,,,,,"A few gripes aside, FIFA has rarely felt better. Thanks to the best Ultimate Team yet and immersive current-gen haptics that make you feel like you’re on the pitch, FIFA 23 is a stylish, expansive final bow for EA’s FIFA series as we know it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The revamped stamina meter leads to a more tactical team game and shooting is consistent and reliable.

Exceptional, challenging gameplay keeps the strength of the game close to its chest, and NBA 2K22 offers an impressive spread of modes to complement that gameplay.

While I felt the same with last year’s NBA 2K21, I feel NBA 2K22 is more evolutionary than revolutionary. Its gameplay systems feel solid enough and fun enough to play for hours on end, however, the game’s heavy reliance on a player’s time to progress through any chunk of content is still prevalent. I would have liked to have seen more openness and choice to MyTeam’s new Draft mode, as it’s the best mode the game has added in years. Of course, I fully expect refinements to continue throughout 2K22s lifespan, so we’ll see where the game ends up in several months. But upon the first two weeks of release, there’s enough here to be excited for what’s to come.","NBA 2K22 is an almost impossible game to rate, because it’s a damn good basketball game at its core. The biggest problem is how it tries to be anything but a basketball game, and while that doesn’t damage the overall quality on the court, it makes it hard to root for it. It’s the ‘03 Lakers, and I hate the ‘03 Lakers.",,,"Aside from the unfortunate microtransactions and bloated hubs, the only fundamental low points are lackluster developments for MyLeague, MyGM, and The W. Each of these modes still plays well, but it's clear they aren't a prime focus. 2K22 doesn't offer much over last year's game for players who enjoy these modes aside from improved gameplay should they hit the court. Despite its flaws, NBA 2K22 still lands as a success for its on-court display, if nothing else. The game feels smoother, more intuitive, and really shines with the haptic feedback on PS5, which makes every move feel engaging.

At this point, it’s hard not to feel like they’re gouging the player. Especially given the exorbitant prices their premium edition versions cost. And it’s so damned frustrating to dislike as much of 2K22 as I did because behind every extra dollar asked of me was an excessively smooth compressed spin or step-back jumper to put a smile on my face. I like NBA 2K22. I wouldn’t say I like it enough to remortgage my home to play it.","NBA 2K22 is not more of the same. It has improved defense, playably is the best in many years, and has added what is effectively an MMO to its MyPlayer. However, the game still feels like early access in certain modes, with bugs that ruin the immersion in MyNBA, and monetization remains a problem for a player unwilling to invest or who doesn't have an edition with some Virtual Currency to use in their MyPlayer.","Much improved over 2K21 and the best 2K in ages, NBA 2K22 is a strongest game still bogged down by legacy virtual currency and gameplay challenges.",,,,,"NBA 2K22 is less a video game and more an advertisement for the sport.

Microtransactions are as aggressive as ever, advertisements and promotions are as invasive as ever, bugs are as common as ever in The City and, overall, it seems that Visual Concepts is doing some things knowing that there are no competitors in the basketball games genre.",,,,,,,"The shining spot for this year’s game is the defensive gameplay and the ability to truly challenge shots and defenders, especially in the paint. It’s extremely satisfying. While a bit of the game remains, NBA 2K22 still offers the closest television experience in a sports video game to date. However, that shot meter is still frustrating as the game remains geared toward its hardcore community who prefer grinding.","NBA 2K22 is the best-looking sports game of this generation, but flashy looks and incredibly deep game modes can't mask the on-court issues that plague this year's offering.","2K22 is a step in the right direction, fixing and improving some of the concerns from the previous entry. There are still a few things that need work, but it is, overall, a fantastic basketball simulator.","2K is about as bad as it gets when it comes to quality of life for players in its online modes that are clearly designed to syphon extra money beyond the price of admission. However, they do make one hell of a basketball game that will allow you to tolerate these scheme-based game modes if you can actually get on to play them.",,,"NBA 2K22 maintains the consistent quality of the series, but some of the old problems of the previous game and the unchanging game mode also makes the game experience lack of surprise.",,,,,,NBA 2K22 does what it takes to make fans fall in love with the franchise again.,,,"NBA 2K22 is a great game in pretty much every facet, over than the overbearing VC issues that have been present for years now.

Still, technical problems persist and microtransactions are hard to ignore in some modes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NBA 2K22 shines on the court, while it struggles in the city. Visual Concepts did a great job getting back on the right steps its basket simulation, and the new shooting system feels good, the new defensive AI is tough and, overall, everything is in the right spot. The new MMORPG-like MyCareer is an ambitious and enormous attempt to maximize the retention of the players. Well, it tries hard, but it doesn't succeed.","NBA 2K22 remains a very good basketball game but it rely too much on its assets and doesn't evolve anymore. It's difficult to see the differences between the 2021 and 2022 versions in terms of technology, graphics and content available to players. However, we notice the efforts made on the gameplay, which is much closer to the reality of the courts and less frustrating, as well as the care given to the My NBA mode. As far as the career mode is concerned, we're clearly left wanting more, it's just a lot of filler, to the detriment of the narrative quality of the career. To conclude, NBA 2K22 remains solid on its feet, still offering the best for a fan of the orange ball, but it's cruelly lacking in creativity and struggling to renew itself.","Instead of walking into the arena and making a grand statement, NBA 2K22 just plays decent basketball. You'll see a few highlight clips, but none that make you want to keep watching in awe. Still, NBA 2K22 is an improvement over last year, even if it's disappointing that it's not making more significant moves. Hopefully, next year we see more shakeups to the lineup to make the game a little more exciting and feel like Visual Concepts is gunning for that championship title.",,,,,,,"NBA 2K22 offers the best on-court experience in the history of the series. That’s no small thing for a series long known for rock-solid gameplay. The problem is that so much around that experience feels incomplete or messy. NBA 2K22 provides such a wide range of experiences that many players will get what they need from it. The overall package, however, is a lot more uneven.",,,"Although NBA 2K22 is the best and only new generation basketball game on the market, it is far from being a perfect game and continues to annoy with its microtransaction-oriented structure.",,"Thanks to an impeccable production, NBA 2K22 feels more immersive and realistic than ever.

It all makes for the best NBA 2K in years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NBA 2K22 is the franchise’s best entry in years, offering well-balanced changes on the court and a bold, yet welcome, revamp of MyCareer and The City hub. Microtransactions still frustrate at times, but they’re not as aggressive or tasteless as they’ve been in the past. For the first time in a while, it feels like the NBA 2K dev team is hungry, and they’ve cooked up a real championship contender this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[Issue#369, p.104]",,"Dying Light 2 is a great game. Its greatest quality is its generosity, whether in the gameplay but also in the heart of its vast open world. I found it entertaining to the highest degree and intelligent with respect to its mechanics, especially with regard to the Parkour. The characters are all credible and we don’t let them down to the end. The ultra satisfying progression system, the craftsmanship, and the possibilities offered by paragliding and grappling make Techland’s game a very complete experience.","Stay Human is a worthy sequel to the original version of Dying Light, one that’s improved excessively in many ways. The Parkour part of the gameplay is especially a great fit, mixed with huge environments and solid level design. If you liked the last game, you’ll definitely find a lot more to enjoy here, but even if you never played Dying Light before, the 2nd version still worth both your time and money.","Dying Light 2: Stay Human takes a while to hit its stride but once it does you'll be running across the rooftops with speed and grace. If packed open world games aren't for you then stay away, otherwise this has incredibly fun mechanics after a slow start.",,"Dying Light 2 is a very interesting and specific experience. It disappoints with its “meh” story and weirdly boring characters, but where its shadow is darkest, there are also areas where it shines the brightest. Its gameplay, most notably parkour, are ridiculously fun, intuitive and open-ended, with great adrenaline segments in the form of the day-night cycle that provide almost completely different gameplay experiences that shall provide you with a lot of hours of fun for sure.","Techland's horror sequel features crunchy combat and thrilling parkour, but buries its best bits with a clumsy story and open-world excess.",,"Dying Light 2: Stay Human has been a long time coming, and thankfully it's worth the wait. I loved the time I spent exploring Villedor; finding random events and scaling buildings took me back to the old days of Assassins Creed II. While I wish I wasn't being timed on the occasions I went into a dark building or decided to explore at night, it's a minor issue to overlook when most of the game is so brilliantly executed and fun to play.","Dying Light 2’s makeup is considerably different from the first game, delivering an impressive and meaty character RPG you can sink time into, even if it does come at the cost of the game’s night-time horrors.",,,,"Strong narrative packed with delightful parkour and fun combat, but the open world is too traditional.",,"Dying Light 2 doesn’t feel original in the slightest, it is bested elsewhere in visuals and gameplay, but as a total package there’s a lot on offer. And gamers will get their money’s worth out of this zombie-bashing post-apocalypse fearfest. It is a game that leaves you with a constant but strangely addictive edge-of-the-seat sense of stress like a strong horror movie. And plenty to discover in a dark, menacing future world.","Dying Light 2 is a fantastic title that manages to improve almost every aspect of the original game. It is one of the most ambitious and beautiful open world games I have ever played, and if you were a fan of the first game, then you should definitely give this one a try. Not only does it blend combat, exploration and storytelling in a superb way, but it also delivers an unforgettable experience that will remain in my heart for years to come.","My final thoughts on my overall experience with Dying Light 2: Stay Human remains positive. Seeing some coverage come out and be turned off by the bugs and issues that were pre-release was expected, but disappointing since I had faith that Techland would stay true to the fans and make sure the experience is covered top to bottom with prime support for the players and community. I commend the entire development team including Lead Designer Tymon Smektala for being engaged with the community leading to the release and listening to what they all have to say. It shows in the final release and look forward to spending even more hours in Villedor for years to come.",,,,,,,,"Dying Light 2: Stay Human feels like it lost its direction somewhere along the way. It begins as an interesting zombie game wherein the threat feels tangible, your character feels weak, and the world feels primed for a dynamic story. However, the further you get into the game, a lot of its early ideas feel sidelined for a generic zombie plot, uninspiring combat, and the absence of any kind of danger.",,,,"Dying Light 2 is safe in some respects, and bold in others: like its propensity to lean into some arcadey notions.","While Dying Light 2 does a lot right with its gameplay and new-gen presentation, it’s still a far cry from zombie gaming greatness. The weak story, uninspired mission design, limitations on initial player skills, and bugs let it down in a big way. Sure, a lot of this will be easy to ignore when fighting the undead as a four-man squad, but “it’s fun with friends” is an excuse that can only get you so far.","As with the original game, Dying Light 2 Stay Human will find its share of audience, while the teams at Techland will continue to expand their vision. The solid base is already there, and it would be interesting to see how the game will turn out in 5 years time.","Techland deserves praise for having put together a well-functioning and well-flowing game, which is also completely free of microtransactions and other nonsense. It's just a shame that the game itself isn't more fun to play.",,"Dying Light 2 has a strong, if restrictive start and manages to pull you into an intriguing mystery that grows into a satisfying finale, with an engaging gameplay loop. However, the game also vastly overstays its welcome. With an overly drawn-out narrative and an irritating main character, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth by the time the credits roll.",,"With a beautiful open world, great narrative side missions, and enough tension to raise even the calmest player's blood pressure, Dying Light 2 wrings a mountain of slick fun out of the most dire of settings. Scary to play solo and a ton of fun in multiplayer, Dying Light 2 will keep you entertained for a long time with its fantastic mission structure and groundbreaking day/night mechanics. It took a while, but Dying Light 2 was worth the wait.","For all its promises about an expansive world that players shape with their choices, Dying Light 2 is essentially a by-the-numbers sequel that doesn’t offer much that’s new. But that’s no bad thing when the reality is that I haven’t had quite this much fun with a AAA video game in years. Techland’s long-awaited zombie RPG mostly delivers the goods in style, providing an expansive - if not entirely original - open-world playground that’s filled with epic action, pleasingly brutal combat, and some difficult choices. The end of the world has never been so entertaining. Just try not to rush through the main story, okay?",,"If you’ve played a zombie game in the past decade, this mishmash of tattered post-apocalyptic stereotypes will feel all too familiar.",,"Dying Light 2 is a masterpiece. We loved the navigation mechanics, brutal combat, deep characters and the feeling of changing the world with every decision. Even though we found some bugs and a little downgrade compared to the E3 gameplay.","I've loved my time with Dying Light 2. While it undoubtedly could use a patch or two, the foundation that's been laid for the next five years is solid. The parkour is fun, the combat engaging, and overall, Stay Human manages to be one of the tensest games of the past decade. It's everything the original was, only better. Can we ask for anything more?",,,"Delivering a huge improvement on the first title, but lacking with new features, Dying Light 2 Stay Human is quite fun, brutal, rewarding and a game of exceptional quality when it comes to the open world. Minor issues still exist here, but Techland successfully manages to live up to the hype surrounding the game.",,,"Techland has managed to create something more important than just another well-written video game. Behold, a convincing open world that encourages you to discover its secrets and provides lots of fun, regardless of what you're doing. Dying Light 2 isn't perfect, but it perfectly makes up for its few flaws. A sequel better than the original!","Dying Light 2 Stay Human may begin like the shuffling corpses you run into during the day, but evolves into the ferocious horde you encounter in the shadows of night. With an engaging gameplay loop of parkour and combat, the exploration of Villedor is something you’ll enjoy for hours on end, and with up to three friends at that. Yeah, it may take a little bit to get hooked, but once you’re infected, it’ll be all you can do to stay human.","Dying Light 2 is a good game that happens to be the long-awaited sequel to a great game. There's still a ton of fun to be had, and the exploration alone is worth the price of admission. At the same time, it's bigger without necessarily being better. I had a lot of fun with it, but I can't help but feel more positive toward the original. If you're looking for a fresh new world to smash zombies in and you're burned out on Harran, then Dying Light 2 will scratch that itch well.","Dying Light 2: Stay Human makes freerunning more fun and creative. By providing more control, main and side quests are surprisingly engaging and deep. The characters come out well through excellent writing and voice work and the player is repeatedly brought into conflict by the many choices that really have an impact on the story. The beautiful Villedor is ideal for endless freerun fun, with or without friends.","Dying Light 2: Stay Human isn't a revolution as the first game, but it is a solid entry with hours and hours of content, although probably not as long as 500 hours. It has everything it needs to become a game that fans are going to love.","Dying Light 2 Stay Human is a solid step-up from Dying Light in almost every way. Still, its increased emphasis on storytelling feels entirely misguided to the point where it’s worse than Dying Light. Despite this, Dying Light 2 has fantastic traversal, satisfying combat, and some great quest design and variety that makes it Techland’s best.","Dying Light 2 Stay Human is the sequel we hoped for and nearly everything Techland promised. There are some technical issues that can affect your quality of gameplay, but I have all the faith in Techland to iron those out, possibly even before its official release. This is going to be the game to beat this year.",,,"Dying Light 2: Stay Human looks more like a DLC to the first game than a whole new one. This does not mean it is a bad game, but it is not one that you should rush to buy. It looks and feels like you are playing the same Dying Light from years ago, and despite the storytelling being solid and entertaining, it is not enough to justify buying it right now.",,,,"Dying Light 2 takes the same survival horror route as the original but improves everything that made the first game so much fun in the first place by breathing life into its world, characters, and narrative. Its RPG elements and dialogue options are a noticeable upgrade and give weight to your decisions, even though they may not always be that impactful. Its greatest strength lies in how it reinvents the idea of survival in a zombie apocalypse. And that makes for a frighteningly good time.","It's been a long time coming, but finally the Dying Light sequel is here. The parkour is refined, the combat is great and the city is lively enough to keep you entertained for a long time. There is also plenty to do in the game, but at the same time it is mainly more of the same without really big innovative steps forward. The first few hours are also disappointing and the visual modes do not offer a best of both worlds standard. A fine sequel, but perhaps a victim of too high expectations.",,"Dying Light 2 is a super solid follow-up to the 2015 original, building upon its fantastic gameplay loop with new traversal options for even more parkour fun. It's extremely disappointing, however, that the narrative and open world promises Techland made in the lead up to launch haven't been realised. Your choices don't have nearly as much impact as we would like, and the map is much more rigid than pre-release footage would have you believe. Still, Dying Light 2 feels awesome and empowering to play, and that can go a long way.",Dying Light 2 takes everything we loved about its predecessor and improves it in a unique way. A very interesting story with ramifications and an entertaining gameplay makes the game highly recommended. Only a small number of visual bugs keep it from reaching its full greatness.,"The challenging development has visibly affected Dying Light 2 in many ways, but it is still a successful game with a lot of content for several passes. I had fun from start to finish and that's the main thing.",,"A little rough around the edges, especially in terms of the storytelling, but the interminable wait for this open world zombie sequel has been worth it.","If one could fear that Dying Light 2 is a 1.5 version of its predecessor, this is not the case in fact. By taking up all the ingredients that made the success of the first episode, Dying Light 2 reinforces, refines and fleshes them out to put them at the service of a breathtaking, generous, fun and complete experience that offers moments of bravery.","Indeed, if, like me, you have a weakness for the zombie-hued, and for the sway and flail of first-person platforming, then Dying Light 2 is easy to recommend.","When the platforming actually works, Dying Light 2 is an absolute blast. Chaining together a high-flying hang glider maneuver, then grappling off the edge of a building before executing a perfectly timed series of jumps makes you feel like a superhero. It’s just too bad that more often than not, something will go wrong and you’ll fall to your death instead.","Dying Light 2 is probably exactly what fans of the first game wanted. The story may not be particularly motivating, but combat is fun while the PS5 powers a smooth experience. A few questionable tweaks by Techland will not be appreciated by all players, but co-op will make it easy to forgive some of that. If you’re not completely tired of zombie games yet, give Dying Light 2 a try. There’s plenty to see and do, and you’ll likely enjoy your harrowing stay in Villedor.",,,,,"Dying Light 2 keeps all the qualities of the first episode, and won't disappoint the lovers of zombies, parkour and weapon tinkering. Despite relatively detailed faces and some beautiful panoramas, the game has some issues, like an annoying open world, which multiplies the tricks already seen elsewhere, especially in Ubisoft productions. We were expecting something more new and fresh.",,"Dying Light 2 has some big technical hurdles to overcome, and fans may want to wait for a patch or two. Yet this a game that is just a joy to jump around. [Issue#12, p.78]","Dying Light 2, as released, has too many technical, design and narrative issues to be fully enjoyable. The game seems hell bent on not letting you enjoy the best it has to offer.",,,,,,"Dying Light 2’s appeal is, ultimately, more game than story. Perhaps Techland’s developers were presented with their own vexing, profoundly consequential choice, where they had to choose to save one structural component or the other. If so, they picked correctly. This is a video game, after all, and a well-balanced combat system, plus exhilarating parkour with effortless contextual moves, can save even the weakest story. Vice versa seems impossible.","Dying Light 2 Stay Human is a unique game that players have waited seven years to play. It’s an ambitious project that aimed to improve upon the original’s mechanics while creating more of a unique world. In many ways, Techland has succeeded, giving us a much more involved story that’s presented better, additional moves and actions that enhance gameplay, more rewarding nighttime features and a great playground in Villedor. The game gets into trouble elsewhere, though.","With a significantly improved movement system, an engrossing, branching narrative, and an open world that's consistently engaging, Dying Light 2 was well worth the extended wait.",,"Dying Light 2 is a bigger and bolder sequel that improves upon the original in every way. Not only does it have one of the most enjoyable traversal systems in any game ever, but it also provides players with interesting characters and quests to break up all the running.","Dying Light 2 expands and refines a formula Techland has been peddling since its breakout success with Dead Island. This sequel learns a lot from modern open world video games, its massive, zombie-infested sandbox rarely feeling empty, especially as you breeze through city blocks with a Mirror's Edge-like finesse. However, Dying Light 2 inherits the same problems - a dull story, tiresome combat, and character progression that’s a tad too sluggish.","Dying Light 2 gives us a sandbox to live and die for. This is the premier adventure game that marries combat and parkour systems for an exceptionally thrilling experience. And while there are moments where the narrative stumbles in terms of consequences, it doesn't matter as waves of zombies move in for the kill. I look forward to the many more hours of content that await on the other side of this campaign.",,"Dying Light 2 ups the ante from the original in almost every way, offering more satisfying parkour, combat and enough jump scares to make you never want to walk in the darkness ever again. A worthy and essential sequel.","Dying Light 2 Stay Human is often let down by noticeable issues, but remains a consistently enjoyable experience until the end nonetheless.",,,,"Dying Light 2 is bigger, better and bolder than its predecessor and even if it's not exactly a looker on console, offers fifty hours of fun for both newcomers and fans of the first game. It's not perfect by any means, but we cannot avoid recommending it.",,,"There's no doubt about it, Dying Light 2: Stay Human is a sequel of epic proportions. Everything fans loved about the original title is still very much present, but now with a bigger story, new features, and a vast open-world filled with areas to explore and loot.",,,,,"Dying Light 2 is messy and uneven. It’s also unique, exhilarating, and just plain fun to play, with one of the best settings in recent memory – despite the nagging feeling that the game could, and should, be more than what it is. Techland has made great strides forward with the sequel, but it’s clear the future of Dying Light can’t be just about making a bigger city to climb around in. The sequel has given the series some good breadth – now it just needs some proper depth.",,,,,,,,I enjoyed my time with Dying Light 2 and found it an entertaining open-world experience that I want to keep playing beyond the 30 or so hours I put into the main storyline.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dying Light 2 Stay Human could have been one of the highlights of the year, but a disappointing story, some frustrating design choices and performance issues mean it doesn’t cash in on its potential.",,,"Dying Light 2 gets off to a slow start, and some might even see it as a slog, but if you see it through just a bit longer, you'll discover a tension-filled journey through the zombie apocalypse that rewards players who are fearless and leap into danger. Soon you'll be gliding, leaping, and zip-lining through the world and cleaving the most deadly of Infected with precision and utter brutality. This is not an easy world to live in, and at times the darkness can almost overwhelm you, but more often than not the rich characters, compelling narrative, and thrill ride combat create a mixture that just can't be resisted, and it's a world I look forward to returning to.",,,,,"With a slow plot and uninteresting characters, Dying Light 2: Stay Human's few redeeming qualities are what sets the franchise apart from other zombie games out there.",,,,,,,"Dying Light 2 Stay Human is another exhilarating parkour and zombie-pummeling playground from Techland, although at times, the seams holding it all together are a bit obvious. Given the game’s glitches, minor gameplay annoyances, and crudely bisected story and world, reports of behind-the-scenes issues feel all-too-plausible. That said, the foundation here is rock solid, and Techland has proven they’re capable long-term builders, so I’m confident Dying Light 2’s embers can be stoked to a full flame in time.",,,,,,,,,,,"So far, it’s a game whose core element—exploration—is often engaging, but because much around it is boring, I need the exploration to be more engaging, and the game’s feature gating hinders that. Again, maybe that changes by the end. But it sounds like it’ll take a long time to get there. Supposedly that's a selling point.","Dying Light 2 is an experience rife with suffering, stemming from its dawdling progression, woeful narrative and intrusive presentation issues. In spite of these shortcomings, the parkour shines once the right equipment and skills are unlocked, salvaging a modicum of joy from this disappointing nightmare.",,,,"The story here pulled me in quickly, and is well worth paying attention to. Exploration with parkour is just plain fun. The game doesn't feel like it's forcing the player to explore and complete every marker on the map, but rather giving the player options for how they want to approach the game. The survival aspects aren't overwhelmingly hardcore, but feel tuned to provide the perfect amount of tension.",,,,"Dying Light 2 is so close to being great, but it is held back by a myriad of technical issues. It's fine with friends, but wait for some patches if you intend to fly solo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overwatch-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overwatch 2 should not be a sequel. Its improvements feel great and perfect the gameplay. The free to play format will keep it afloat and introduce many to a fantastic hero shooter with impressive charisma, but it is not a sequel. What was seen here should have come sooner and may well be insufficient for fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overwatch 2 has the same strengths as the first game. It's a new version of an enjoyable multiplayer shooter. But it lacks many essential things. The servers don't work well, it doesn't have a lot of new content and buying new stuff is extremely expensive. The gameplay is excellent, and the foundation is set, but there's still a long road ahead.",,,,,,,"Overwatch 2 is not a full sequel in the way one usually is, instead porting over the original game and enhancing it with a bit of new content. It doesn't justify the number at the end, but that doesn't take away from what is still a terrific multiplayer experience. Removing the price point entirely, Overwatch 2 can now be considered one of the best free-to-play games around.",,"It’s really difficult to even grade this game. Should it be called “Overwatch 2” at all? And how is it going to grow? Right now, it brings next to nothing to veterans but still remains a very good team shooter.",,,,,"The introduction of passive abilities for each role sounds subtle on paper, but when Reaper goes on a spree, gaining a 25 percent boost to movement and reload speed for 2.5 seconds with each elimination, he becomes a lot more deadly. Across the board, these passives and individual character toolkits incentivize a more aggressive approach to play that emphasizes hero roles more than ever before. It’s an elevated version of the original’s execution that takes some getting used to, but once you do, it’s a lot more fun and satisfying, because the big plays get even bigger.",,,,,,,,"Fun at times.

In terms of play, Overwatch 2 is more fun to play than it has ever been. We are in luck, however, as Blizzard has clearly been keenly listening to the community since the launch of the game didn't go very smoothly, and the potential for more fixes and fine-tuning seem like it's their biggest priority. It will be interesting to see where things are after a year, that's the blessing and the curse of a live-service game. But for now…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But it’s a solid take on the classic action platformer, and is bound to entertain those who were around during the genre’s heyday, as well as newcomers keen on some challenging action.",,,,,,,"I loved Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider, but it won’t be for everyone. It’s a must-play for 2D action platform veterans. Especially those that value speedrunning. The 80s inspirations hit all the right nostalgia buttons for me.

If you’re at all curious, don’t hesitate to pick it up.",,,"Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider is visceral, brutal and quite challenging - which is great. With beautiful pixel art graphics, a great soundtrack and satisfying combat, it's a must-have title for fans of the 16-bit era.",,,,,"Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider is a game that stepped right out of the '90s. It's a fun little platformer that controls well and is a delight to play, and it evokes a remarkable amount of nostalgia for a game that is coming out in 2023. Much like Blazing Chrome, it's the closest you'll come to a new Strider game that plays like the old-school Strider. If that is what you're looking for, you'll be delighted, and if you love old-school platforming action, Moonrider offers it in spades, without the quarter-munching or rental fees.",,,,,,"At the end of the day, Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider is a solid retro-inspired action game that does a good job of offering a satisfying albeit brief campaign. You could definitely do a lot worse but there is substantial room for improvement, that's for sure.",,,,"As Blazing Chrome, Vengeful Guardian Moonrider is a neat tribute to old action games. It really feels like a lost Mega Drive title, but on more modern platforms. A good retro trip with a gorgeous aesthetics from the 90s and a soundtrack that could have been in a Streets of Rage game. Imperfect, yes, but generous.",,,,"Each level feels unique, and goes through phases that ensure the gameplay remains interesting and engaging. And it’s all complemented by a jaw-dropping art style, which can feel a little grungy on occasion, but has some true standout set-piece moments – like the boss enemies that fill the entire screen. A CRT toggle is available for true retro enthusiasts, but we preferred to play with unfiltered, razor-sharp 4K pixels.

As far as interactive narrative adventures go, it’s one of the most passive we’ve encountered, feeling more like an animated TV series than a video game.

Thankfully, the excellent music videos do offer some redemption, and if you stick with it, you’ll eventually warm to its colourful cast. However you feel about them though, you probably won’t have played anything else quite like this.",,,"We Are OFK is a poignant story of growing up in the modern era, where love and music go hand in hand to shape our futures and lives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We Are OFK is an incredibly well-written game that stretches the boundaries of the medium. There's not a lot of traditional gameplay, but the characters are so well-realised and the writing so strong that even though there’s not much for you to do during each of the episodes, the act of being there and listening remains highly engaging. Between the strong art and soundtrack, there’s a lot to like, even if there’s not a lot to play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A short, sweet season of story let down by the choice of form. We respect the experimental interpolation, though perhaps they should’ve played this piece straight. [Issue#19, p.87]",,,"The biggest success of the game, though, is its sense of authenticity. The LGBT+ representation is excellent, with diverse characters normalising queer relationships. The developer's devotion to authentic twentysomething reference points is commendable. And where so many music stories push songwriting and acoustic instruments as more ""authentic"" than manufactured pop, here the secret to success is simple: just be yourself.",,,,,,,,,,,,"A stylish, well-voiced, visual novel that tells a poignant and heartfelt story over five, one-hour episodes, We Are OFK is more interactive TV series than game. Let yourself drift away in its peaceful melancholia, but don’t expect much in the way of gameplay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I know this game isn’t going to be for everyone – but I don’t think it needs to be. We Are OFK is by no means perfect – but it’s undeniably something special.,,,,,"Undoubtedly set to be divisive, We Are OFK will garner fans in with its catchy pop tunes and emotional storytelling, but also lose just as many with narrative and character omissions, light gameplay and purposefully cheesy dialogue. Still, for better or worse, this is an experience not like many others. Captivating cinematography also paints a haunting if bittersweet L.A. narrative. Like a classic pop debut that its own self is based on, We Are OFK has heart and moments that’ll reel you in while remaining plenty messy. If all else, isn’t that how this road was always going to go?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you loved the original Life is Strange, We Are OFK should be on both your list of games to play and most definitely on your music playlist. It’s a banger, though it should be said, Debug deserves its own game.","I enjoyed my time with We Are OFK. Even for a visual novel, the storyline can feel a bit too on the rails at times, but Itsumi, Carter, Luca, and Jey's journey is poignant in its relatability and powerful in its narrative exploration through music. This is best expressed in the interactive music video segments, especially when they allow you to fully lose yourself in the song and respond to the vocals, rhythm, or accompanying visuals in your own way. It's a good opening track for OFK's career, and I can't wait to see what's in store for the virtual group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We Are OFK came out of nowhere and immediately captured my attention. While the game’s concept has been done before on TV, this is, to my knowledge, the first time a video game has told the story of a fictional (or perhaps I should say, virtual) band that makes and releases real music. Really good music that I may or may not be listening to as I write this review. The plot has a few pacing issues and the gameplay is limited, but the art style is undeniably attractive, the writing is great, and I love the cast. If a future sequel — shall we say a season two? — means more time with these messed-up goofballs and more great music, I’m all for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The story lacks a punch with unnecessary politics inserted, although the humour can sometimes still be pretty great. Combat is still great and fun, with a fantasy setting and few additions sprinkled on the familiar BL formula, but Wonderlands misses out on the potential to make a truly new experience that will differ from its very close cousin, condemning itself to be appealing to mostly Borderlands fans, which still poses a good game, but misses the chance to become a great one.",,,,,,,,,,,"Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is a fantastic spinoff that manages to combine everything that makes Borderlands great, and even improves on the formula with welcome additions such as magic and a brand new fantasy setting. Sure, the humor and the loot system can be a little bit overwhelming at times, but even then, it's still an awesome time. The shooting and the gameplay mechanics feel responsive and precise, plus the 120FPS mode really makes the game feel much smoother than the standard 60FPS and 4K mode.",,"Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is an easy recommendation for Borderlands and D&D fans, but those who have had their fill of the franchise may get tired of the repetitive combat and constantly looting useless items. The technical problems are the biggest issue, so hopefully, Gearbox Software releases new Tiny Tina's Wonderlands updates to address them soon.",,,,,,,,"Tiny Tina's Wonderland is an ode to tabletop role-playing games that will transport the player to a first person perspective.

The campaign will keep you glued to your seat thanks to its excellent storytelling and fantastic voice cast. And its world outshines just about any we’ve seen in the Borderlands series yet; it’s huge, and offers so much scope to explore even beyond the main story and side quests. Its endgame is promising too, offering plenty of reason to keep jumping back in. Is it Gearbox’s best game to date? Once those few bugs are tidied up, it might just be. And considering it was made under pandemic restrictions, that really is a feat.",,,,,,,,,,,"Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is the fantastic fantasy version of Borderlands, and as the spinoff progresses, it closely remembers previous successes, which at times felt a little unoriginal. Thankfully, with excellent writing, hilarious performances from an all-star cast, and ridiculous combat shines and make this tabletop-inspired blast festival absolutely worth it.",,,,,,"Tiny Tina's Wonderlands doesn't kick the board to reformulate the Borderlands series, but it brings enough fresh air to boost the series. The game characters, dialogues and craziness are much more interesting, dynamic and fun than in previous entries, and they provide a good base on which to build future titles in the franchise.","While Tiny Tina's Wonderlands doesn't offer a vastly different experience from what came before, it does venture outside of its comfort zone enough to establish its own identity. It's an excellent extension of the already great Assault On Dragon Keep, and is a worthwhile adventure for any fan of the series, with extensive build crafting, an entertaining cast of characters, and a world worth exploring.",,,"Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is a quirky and silly looter shooter that simply doesn't distinguish itself enough from the mainline Borderlands games. It's still a lot of fun, though, especially when you play with friends.","Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is one of the best games ever by Gearbox. It is a lot of fun, with a great duration and gameplay that invites you to spend countless hours playing. If you have some friends that play it too, it is a blast.",,"Despite the optimization issues, the network problems with the Shift servers that cause momentarily framerate drops, the fact that there are some unexplainable crashes and various bugs, Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is a truly wonderful experience for all Borderlands fans. It is different enough, so veterans won’t see it just a reskin, and familiar enough to get lost in the game world. The voice acting is the best up to date, with a tremendous performance from actors like Will Arnett. Tina’s voice is Ashly Burch, who gives a very different performance here compared to Horizon’s Alloy. Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands has plenty of issues and there is room for improvement, but it is a good game with plenty to keep you entertained.",,,,,"Tiny Tina's Wonderlands retains the inherently entertaining shootin' and lootin' gameplay that the Borderlands series is known for, but you're frequently held back from enjoying it because of repetitive missions, tedious busywork, oodles of padding, and the game's relentless need to be funny.

call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii,,,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 does what it sets out to do, continues the homage to the original games, with updated storylines, well-crafted characters, surprisingly impactful additions, and proposes openings for what may be the franchise's best moment in this regard for some time. The promised evolutions are here. In fact, CoD seems to aim to impact the player with visual improvements and differentiated experiences that enrich the final product, but fails in the search for novelties relevant enough to maintain the same freshness in multiplayer modes.","Modern Warfare II's problems are old ones, then, as are its strengths. But there are fewer of the latter than in 2019's reboot, and that should concern fans. [Issue#379, p.112]",,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is an excellent opus, which offers breathtaking visuals but which also confirms that the campaigns are still as breathtaking and enjoyable as ever!

[Campaign Review Score = 90]",,,"Call of Duty is bouncing back after a terrible last entry to give us a very good FPS. The campaign lacks the punch that gave the original game it's legendary status, but the multiplayer modes are fun, engaging and miles better than Vanguard's.","CoD MW 2 is a refreshing single-player experience, providing players with some of the best action-packed moments and great characters, but riddled with multiplayer balancing issues and extreme performance and technical problems. It still is CoD and is fun for anyone who finds its casual shooting gameplay compelling, but it plays safely and doesn’t present itself as something revolutionary for the franchise.","Conversely, Modern Warfare II’s multiplayer offering is rock solid, comprising a highly polished suite of modes catering to a wide range of playstyles. Traditional small-sided shoot-outs still dominate, of course, but quirkier maps help keep things fresh. Santa Sena Border Crossing takes place on a stretch of highway filled with empty but highly explosive vehicles, while Crown Raceway inexplicably takes place in the pit lanes of an F1 track.",,"Despite high production values, Modern Warfare II is a tad underwhelming. A pretty yet predictable campaign, decent multiplayer that is unsure about how it’s supposed to play, and the sweet taste of Spec Ops mean this is an uneven, but enjoyable enough package. What’s clear is Call of Duty really, really needs a proper break to reset.","Modern Warfare 2 is an enjoyable first-person shooter, and if some of its issues get addressed, it could be the best Call of Duty title we’ve had for a number of years. However, with the highly-anticipated, free-to-play Warzone 2 launching so soon after, it’s hard to see a world where MW2 gets the attention it needs.",,,,,,"It is bombastic, dude-bro all-in fighting from start to finish and there’s months of replayability with the online multiplayer. It’ll get gun game fans not only through Christmas but most of 2023 too because it’s so damn moreish. For that reason it’s not only a top-tier game but one with huge value-for-money.","It is a game that remains decent, it is not at all the fifth wonder of the world, but neither can it be interpreted as a disaster that will leave users indifferent, especially the most fanatical. The next installment must commit to delivering a product worthy of the new generation of consoles, since it seems that PS4 and Xbox One are limiting in some way.",,,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is a continuation of one of the best Call of Duty games in years. Rather than acting as yet another overhaul, Infinity Ward has fine-tuned the standout first-person shooter to provide one of the deepest multiplayer customization options in the space.

Despite many woes at launch, players are treated to top-notch gameplay and movement that continues to satisfy, especially now that weapon stats can be adjust in granular ways. And with more content to come, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is sure to satisfy.","There is value to Modern Warfare 2’s campaign. It is art. It’s also just intense fun throughout, because it is ultimately a video game. To say anything else is to take away from the years of hard work that has gone into producing this spectacle. But we can’t forget about the context: millions of people, a lot of them very young and impressionable, will play this campaign. This is why it’s important to have these sorts of conversations. The campaign constantly dances a wobbling tightrope between being too fantastical and exposing the realities of modern war. Sometimes it slips too far into the realistic horrors, and it’s unable to commit, so it has to pull you back with just one more big budget explosion.

The story mode was a blast, and the multiplayer is just as addicting as ever. It’s one of the best looking games we may have so far, and I recommend playing it on a next gen console or souped-up PC if you can to see it at its full potential. Infinity Ward has proven yet again that Call of Duty is at the forefront of the FPS genre, and I’m really impressed with how they continue to drive the series forward.",,,,,,,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II brings the core of what makes CoD games great and stays true to Infinity Ward's best efforts in the series. It's big step away in a positive direction from last year's Vanguard disaster. I just wish there was a bit more meat to sink my teeth into. The single player campaign makes no attempt at a commentary but will have you running through a series of competent missions and set pieces. Multiplayer is what you would expect from the series, both with competent gunplay as well as a map playlist that will need to expand over time. The new co-op mode seems a better experience with a friend than queuing with a random from the lobby. All in all there is good game on offer that moves slicker and the shine on your assault rifle looks more gorgeous than the series ever has.",,"With plenty more to test in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, we’ll update this review to include a breakdown of its multiplayer, but as far as the campaign goes, Infinity Ward has put out a solid effort that surpasses most Call of Duty campaigns we’ve seen over the last five years. It’s a good sequel to 2019’s reboot, but still follows some all too familiar tropes, with some of the characters not getting the spotlight they deserve. [Review in progress]","In our era of coldly distanced technological combat, of armoured police vehicles on city streets, of protests bloodily subdued, we might ask why such violent delights as Modern Warfare still have a place on the entertainment calendar. It’s something I’ve pondered over the many hours I’ve spent thoroughly enjoying this ludicrous game. It is something I will perhaps go on to think through in the many, many hours to come.","Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, although not completely perfect, is one of the better installments in the franchies in recent years. A solid singleplayer delivers a thrilling rollercoaster with diverse gameplay and settings. The spec-ops is a nice co-op warm up, but the real deal here is the multiplayer. With tightly designed gameplay, maps that suit the different modes well, a lot of content to choose from, Infinity Ward really hit a sweet spot with this newest installment.","Modern Warfare 2 is a worthy Call of Duty game. Campaign is fun, and multiplayer is full of content, with the ""bulletproof"" gameplay we (and millions of players) love. But it is not a risky move, as Modern Warfare was. Better game than Vanguard, but still on the conservative side.",,,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II 2022 is a fan’s nerdgasm, all your favourites with a couple of new talented cast members duking it out against the titular villains of the original franchise trio once again. The game delivers where it counts and I can only find minimal things to fault it on. One additional gripe I had was with the force feedback itself, I’ll have to look into if the sensitivity for it can be toggled or customised, because often it felt too strong. Like it required more of a pull of the trigger than it felt would be necessary, that might be trying to simulate the real thing but at times it felt imbalanced. Another minor gripe to be sure.","Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 distances itself from the original titles and is below in quality even from the 2019 game. It is still a great option as an FPS and delivers plenty of content, but it is clear that an evolution did not happen as expected.",,,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a video game equivalent of Marvel Cinematic Universe. There's a lot of fun, gunplay feels great, and all of that sounds and looks excellent (it definitely is one of the prettiest games out there). But we still wouldn't nominate MW2 a game of the year.",,,"Modern Warfare 2 is a Call of Duty game without any surprises, but that in itself is also no surprise. Some new features do not flourish, but Modern Warfare 2 is a traditionally complete game thanks to its great multiplayer and almost nostalgic single player.",,,,,,"Call of Duty Modern Warfare II delivers exactly what everyone knew it would. It has some issues, of course, like the lack of multiplayer maps and the bad UI, but it's a really fun and well-rounded shooter. If you love CoD, you gonna love MWII.",,"Modern Warfare II is almost a perfect game. But the almost part is more significant than you’d be tempted to believe, and unfortunately, it sometimes makes the game a work-in-progress. If you’re buying the game specifically to play the campaign, there is both good news and bad news here. The campaign is insanely awesome, and you’ll have a lot of fun playing it, but on the other hand, it feels way too short. Each mission feels like a different game, and it can be completed in a different way every time. On the other hand, the multiplayer side of Modern Warfare II is what seems to disappoint most of the fans. The bugs, the crashes, the lack of multiplayer options, and the behavior of some players ruin the experience. In case you’re wondering if the new anti-cheating system works, it looks like it does, though you may still occasionally come across players that kill you with a single shot in the very first second they spot you.",,,,,"If you're eager to get started with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, then the campaign will serve you well until the multiplayer and online co-op mode unlocks on Friday. With many missions that break away from the status quo, it's not always just about shooting the bad guys. From high-speed car chases and crafting systems to the turrets of an AC-130, Modern Warfare 2 thoroughly entertains when it's offline. [Campaign review]","Call of Duty Modern Warfare II opted for a new graphics engine, and the result was outstanding. Visually it looks impressive, especially in the water effects. The combat mechanics are great, and the multiplayer is also entertaining. Despite being short, the campaign is enjoyable and worth finishing, not only to unlock extras but also to appreciate all the technical advances this title has to offer. Its price is high, and it makes perfect sense to buy it if you are a fan of the series. We also recommend being patient and finding the best offer first.","The campaign might be forgettable, but it’s bailed out by the excellent multiplayer experience. Infinity Ward confirms that it’s simply the best caretaker studio of the Call of Duty franchise. But they must not rest on their laurels because the game needs long-term support.","Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 isn't as massive a revolution as the previous installment, but it doesn't have to be. The game is varied, pops better than ever before and offers a delicious shot of nostalgia. It just needs some time to really belong to the top of the franchise.","A mild disappointment compared to the first Modern Warfare reboot, that relies too much on nostalgia and old ideas, but the core action and multiplayer modes are as irresistible as ever. [Review in Progress; Provisional score = 70]","With very solid foundations that do honor to the 2019 opus, the series innovates, bringing new gameplay, new equipment clearly welcome. Above all, the progression is much smoother - with a nice job on the system to unlock weapons! Somewhere, everything is done to welcome new players and this is a very good point. Even the third-person mode is surprisingly successful. Overall, this opus will undoubtedly lose the purists accustomed to faster gameplay. For the rest, if you want to indulge yourself with frenetic action, this is ideal. [Multiplayer Review Score = 80]",,"Modern Warfare 2 is one of the most baffling Call of Duty games in years. It caters to newcomers, punishes veterans, and alienates everyone with overcomplicated menus. The campaign and Ground War are worthwhile. But Modern Warfare 2 still needs a lot of work to live up to its predecessors, and may not be worth your money just yet.","Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 subtly improves on a winning formula. It’s no real surprise that the multiplayer gunplay is the best in the series to date, but considering this is coming from the team that started this craze to begin with it’s to be expected. While the campaign may play it mostly safe, it features an enjoyable challenge, with a couple of interesting survival-type sections that almost turn it into another game entirely. There’s little doubt most Call of Duty players will feel right at home playing Modern Warfare II as it’s a solid entry and seemingly the shooter to play this holiday season and beyond.","Modern Warfare 2 can be exciting when it works. Whilst the campaign’s narrative flaws can’t be fixed, major patchwork is needed to get the multiplayer (the most important aspect) to a good place, and co-op is in desperate need of extra content. Big games just shouldn’t be in this state at launch.",,,,"This year's Call of Duty is a solid installment, with gameplay that captures the best of what's been done in recent years. There's a feeling of best of deja vu but it's quite effective. The multiplayer also offers a well-oiled but unsurprising formula. Neither the best episode of the saga nor the worst, Modern Warfare II remains overall very pleasant to play.","Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2‘s campaign is an impressive reminder that when the franchise is firing on all cylinders, it’s still a force to be reckoned with... even if its politics remain a bit muddled. [Campaign review score = 80]","The best gunplay in the series struggles in the face of a poor plot. What you do in the campaign is nicely varied enough, but there’s very little substance.

But sadly, all I was left with was a boring-as-hell opening set of levels that are only loosely made up for with level structures lifted from other AAA games later on. And I have little desire to play through the sequences where I’m shooting people who don’t feel like a threat. I guess there’s the multiplayer to look forward to, but this campaign is a wildly missed opportunity for those who enjoy military-themed first-person shooters. [Campaign Impressions]","As enjoyable as Modern Warfare II is — and it is certainly enjoyable on the whole — the moments when the story prompts uncomfortable real-world questions about the game’s intentions shatter its illusion of immersive entertainment. In those moments, I forget about whatever it is that Capt. Price and Co. are tasked with doing and just wonder what people were thinking when they made the decision to include whatever cringeworthy moment I just witnessed. As Infinity Ward plunges ahead with this story — teasing an upcoming Russian attack during a mid-credits cutscene that includes a nod to the airport massacre from the original Modern Warfare 2 — they’d do well to devote a little more scrutiny to such decisions.

Still, there’s an action-packed story to play through, plenty of multiplayer and a light co-op mode, and the promise of more in future. With Warzone 2.0 just around the corner, the future is certainly bright for Modern Warfare 2.","Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is Call of Duty at its finest in terms of settings and overall gameplay. You won’t have an emotional attachment to the campaign, but you’ll find excitement in late-game missions.

Once you get over the initial hurdle of getting used to the controls it starts to become a more relaxing experience… but not so calm that you won’t find yourself occasionally shanking your shot into the water or slicing into a bunker. Ultimately though it’s a fun way to spend some time in virtual nature.","PGA Tour 2K23 is a good evolution from the previous games in the series, delivering an awesome golf simulation, a good improvement in its technical aspects and a good Career mode for solo players. Its only issues are the lack of more elaborate multiplayer modes, but it’s undeniable that this is a franchise on the rise.",,,,,,,,,"PGA TOUR 2K23 doesn’t hit you with a shipload of content, but with some of the best gameplay ever in a golf game along with returning features like MyCAREER, Societies, Quick Match, and the course designer as well as the addition of Topgolf and the new MyPLAYER Archetype/Skill system, there’s plenty of replay value at the virtual links.",,,"PGA Tour 2K23 may have the best golf simulation ever in a videogame. It's just a shame that it does not have the visuals and game modes to match it. It feels really good to take some swings on it, but the game lacks some of the major tournaments and also experiences that go beyond the Career Mode.",,,,"While PGA Tour 2K23 offers one of the best golf video game experiences yet, there is still so much more it can do in elevating the golf experience to showcase the thrills that come with being a pro.",,,,,"PGA Tour 2K23 takes an already excellent golfing simulator and builds upon it, making it better and more fleshed out by adding things that were sorely needed. We’re still waiting for properly glamourous careers and tournaments but the gameplay itself will spellbind every golf fan.","PGA Tour 2K23 takes quite a few steps compared to its predecessor. It's the ultimate zen game, as deep or as accessible as you want. An ideal medicine in a world full of sports games that want to be louder and more spectacular, but lose sight of what it is all about in the first place: an accurate representation of the sport.","The basics of gameplay work tremendously well, but the game is bogged down by too many niggling faults and the sense that it’ll take until at least next year to fulfil its potential.",,,,,"PGA Tour 2K23 is more than just the standard annual sports release with minor changes here and there. It's a two-year project that has added a ton of star power and new features. HB Studios clearly went back to the drawing board on this one and found new ways to make 2K's golf franchise even more competitive and invigorating...Its realism and immersive qualities easily overshadow some of its weaker moments and make this one of the best sports games, period, and will have you eager to board the birdie train.","PGA Tour 2K23 evolved from the last entry in multiple ways. The three-click swing adds another layer of playability, My Career is better than the previous one and the Top Golf mode is a fun multiplayer variation. There's still room for improvement and we can't wait to see the game against the upcoming EA's rivalry.","While lacking in presentation and depth in ist career-mode, PGA Tour 2K23 is a compelling golf-simulation. The gameplay turns out to be both challenging yet satisfying and keeps players motivated for a lot of hours.","PGA Tour 2K23 ups its game from the previous release.

Or will the appeal of those courses I badly miss pull me back to EA?","It seems like my best bet — if I want to more fully enjoy my time with PGA Tour 2K23 — would be to turn off downswing timing. Either that, or it might be time to put this franchise on my personal “I don’t need this stress in my life” list, right next to Elden Ring.","2K and HB Studios have made the necessary additions and changes to make PGA TOUR 2K23 the best in the series. The three-click swing option opens play up for everyone while also eliminating the frustration of having to be overly precise with the Swing Stick. Topgolf is that couch co-op golf that everyone has been waiting for while MyPLAYER finally sees a progression arc added to the series. The game does get held back by a lack of meaningful changes to the Online Mode and that includes no cross play, which frankly makes no sense. Connectivity was fine during the pre-launch period for the three-hole rounds, Divot Derby and Topgolf. The option to select a PGA Pro for Topgolf is needed, however, as it currently isn’t available. Along with those things and the microtransaction aspect, the positives outweigh the negatives and PGA TOUR 2K23 simply brings back the fun in golf.",,PGA Tour keeps evolving and polishing the series with the best entry so far.,"If you're willing to devote the time needed to this title, you'll find one of the most exciting sports games around.

The roster features first-rate stars and some global icons such as Michael Jordan and Steph Curry, while the routes included should keep fans busy for quite a while (thanks to the plethora of content produced by its passionate community). TopGolf mode is a great variation on the theme, and online multiplayer is robust albeit lacking in substantial novelties. The graphics sector, on the other hand, can be improved: the quality of the animations and paths is fluctuating and not up to what is achieved by Visual Concepts / 2K with NBA 2K23.","Golf lovers will surely enjoy PGA Tour 2K23, despite some technical flaws that make the game improvable on PS5.","Despite some of my frustrations with how boring PGA Tour 2K23 can feel, that also just feels like golf in a nutshell. Golf is an old game with very little innovation, so watching the most popular golf game franchise follow that same path makes sense.

It’s good, not great.",,,,,,,"Black Ops Cold War is a good game, no question about it, but it's also a warning shot for Activision in regards to the Call of Duty franchise. The story campaign of this game was lackluster way too often and the multiplayer aspect of the game will probably be overshadowed by the more popular Warzone. The next game in the series needs to do something drastically different.",,"In keeping with the period aesthetic, Black Ops Cold War feels like a throwback in all senses of the word.

There is more than enough content here to satisfy players too, but the not-so-great story missions disappointed.","Call of Duty needs to lean on three pillars every year. If one staggers, like multiplayer, the taste in the mouth that leaves is not what we demand of an annual product, and that is the case of Black Ops Cold War. Luckily, it shouldn't take much more than the start of the Seasons and the arrival of new content to fix.",,,,"Overall, there have been better Call of Duty games in the past, particularly around the single-player campaign. But Black Ops Cold war gets both the multiplayer mode and zombies just right and those are the ones that really count most for fans.","Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War feels like a backwards step for the franchise. A pretty forgettable campaign and an ok multiplayer, makes it a good, but not great new Call of Duty.",,,"The PlayStation 5 version of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is the best in the bunch. It tells a solid campaign with branching narrative choices, contains some of the best visuals that you’ve seen on a system not called ‘PC’, and it has some good, new faces on the multiplayer scene. Is it all perfect? Not at all, but it’s a good way for Call of Duty to start on the next generation of consoles.",,,I've never played a game more thoroughly unpleasant than Black Ops Cold War...,,,"Despite its enjoyable campaign, Black Ops Cold War feels like an anachronistic package. The era of one game containing three completely disparate modes feels so long ago in the age of Warzone.","Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is yet another entry for the same formula that still stands after more than a decade now. This game goes back to the origins of the franchise with not many novelties to highlight, but it displays huge production values that help avoid any sort of fatal mistake. In the end, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is your run-of-the-mill Call of Duty experience for those who simply want it to keep on coming.","I have no doubt that the latest Call of Duty will earn ridiculous amounts of money once again, but I will remember it as a dip in form, a game that’s closer to mediocrity than greatness.

But like nearly all Call of Duty games, that is the content you'll breeze through within your first week playing if even for just a few hours a day. The bulk of the ride ends up being multiplayer and zombies and that is where the problems really lie. This is a game that I'm sure will eventually get the extra content, balancing, and bugs worked out along a series of patches and end up being much better than it is today. But unfortunately the buggy, laggy, unbalanced, and content-sparse game we get at launch is the only one I was given to review.

Ultimately, with its lack of a clear vision and focus on what makes a game fun, Cold War isn’t going to entertain you for long.",,,,,,,"While there are redeeming qualities in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, the multiplayer offering just can’t hold up to its predecessor and the cross-platform bundle doesn’t offer enough to make up for the price boost on PS5.",,,,"Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War does very more-of-the-same in places — it’s the franchise’s 17th instalment, after all — but when a formula has been so fine-tuned, it’s hard to expect the developers to monkey around with it too much.",,,,,,"As solid as the package is, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War has to be one of the safest series instalments for quite some time. Multiplayer is seriously starting to show its age with tired ideas and even duller gameplay, leaving the campaign to rescue things.

A passable effort for the start of the PS5 generation, but Activision must buck up its ideas for next year.",,,,,"While its campaign is very fun and features great gameplay ideas wrapped in 1980s action movie codes, its multiplayer is disappointing. The weapons lack punch, the cards are few and unequal, the new modes are anecdotal, the whole is unbalanced.","What I didn’t expect from the new Call of Duty was downtime, and the suggestion, at least in the first half, that guns, while great for going in blazing, can provide just as potent a thrill when holstered.",,"Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is a return to form for the franchise sub-series. While perhaps not as visually splendid as last year’s Modern Warfare, it gets the Black Ops series back to boots on the ground, introducing new characters and elements while lending adequate time and attention to series favorites. Treyarch expertly steps in to continue the recent interconnected Call of Duty franchise shift, exploring and evolving the series while still creating a game that not just retains but oozes that signature Treyarch style. Perhaps more than any Call of Duty game before it, I’m more excited than ever to see where it goes in the future.",,,,,,,,,,"Treyarch delivers an impressive package considering the circumstances, but Black Ops Cold War feels like a step back from last year.",,"Cold War takes all those positives from Modern Warfare, and now we’re one step further with pretty much cross-everything.

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is a reliable package that brings the Black Ops franchise back to its roots. This Call of Duty is safe to declassify.",,,,,"Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War acts as a return to form for the series as Treyarch takes a safe approach to design and online modes. The campaign’s choice-driven narrative is a huge plus as it helped introduce a level of immersion that the series desperately needed, but it relies a bit too heavily on the big twists than the smaller story beats. With a foundation as good as this laid out, it will be interesting to see how it evolves in future updates.",,,,"Thankfully, a few of the early bugs were ironed out of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, and subsequent season passes have patched up modes and maps that were lacking. The campaign is genuinely intriguing but may not appeal to those who just want to run and gun. Zombies and Multiplayer modes are plentiful and there should be something for everyone to thoroughly enjoy. Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War should be used as the poster child for PlayStation 5's DualSense controller which has been put to full use for an immersive experience. Casual players will be somewhat put off by the sheer storage space required to fully experience everything that is on offer, especially given that SSD capacity is this generation's gold dust, but Call of Duty die-hards will most likely overlook this.",,,,,,,,,"Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is a solid entry in the blockbuster franchise that looks stunning on next-gen consoles. While its campaign fails to deliver on its potential, it still takes you on a thrilling tale of explosive espionage as you uncover the true identity of Perseus. Combine this with an old-school multiplayer component and expanded Zombies mode and you’ve got a shooter experience I can easily recommend.",,,,"Call of Duty’s moment-to-moment gameplay is still primarily a well-dressed shooting gallery, but Black Ops Cold War succeeds in making its quiet time a defining part of its experience rather than just a deep breath between the loud and explode-y sequences.

As the seasons continue, Cold War could certainly improve, but for now, it isn’t an essential purchase.",,,,"It's reasonable to expect updates to Cold War at a steady clip. Weapons will be tweaked, issues will be patched, and gameplay will be balanced. Zombies has a strong foundation and may very well be improved further by potential updates, but the gap between multiplayer and the Warzone ecosystem is too wide to be bridged by small tweaks. Zombies is a good co-op time overall, but multiplayer falls flat, leaving the strong campaign to do most of the heavy lifting.",,,"Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War continues the trend of adding a ton of bang for your buck. While I don’t participate in some of the modes there is still enough here to keep me interested enough to make it worth my time and money. The campaign is the best I have played in a while. The multiplayer suite has something for everyone, and the zombies mode continues to be a nice diversion. There is something for just about everyone here, and it is a nice showpiece for these new consoles to boot.

The boss fights feel a little less tightly designed than they did in the first game, but it's a small complaint at best, and there's still plenty to enjoy here.

ghostwire-tokyo,,,,"For the duration of its story, it grips like a grasping, otherworldly arm. [Issue#371, p.104]","Ghostwire: Tokyo is relaxing and pretty, and spending time exploring its rain-soaked metropolis is almost worth the price of admission by itself. It is also, however, a disappointing game that fails to fulfill its own potential with a repetitive combat system, too much checklist-ticking busywork, and an undercooked main storyline that fails to live up to its promise and contains no notable secondary characters. Ghostwire: Tokyo isn’t a bad game — it just feels like it could have been so much more.","Ghostwire Tokyo is not a bad game but it sounds hollow when we put down the controller after the few 10h of game he offers. His Tokyo is very beautiful and wonderfully transcribed, the power-based gameplay is effective, but it lacks possibilities and we repeat all the time the same thing and the same actions which makes the overall adventure redundant. In addition, it doesn’t tell much... Too bad, because the theme and the atmosphere are there!","Ghostwire: Tokyo is neither a failure nor a huge success, as it fails to offer anything new in terms of story telling, gameplay or world design, but it can still be an entertaining action adventure.",,"Ghostwire: Tokyo is a first person horror game, nothing too revolutionary in this day and age, but this game has a ton of personality, something that is very hard to say about other horror games today. I would love more attention to the soundtrack, but it's amazing visuals and fun gameplay are amazing enough.",,"Ghostwire Tokyo is rarely a scary game, Tango stopping short of full horror, but it still has the ability to unsettle. It may be an acquired taste and far from flawless, but its distinctive approach and commitment to its ethos has plenty of spirit.",,"Shinju Mikami does it again, this time in a new genre. Ghostwire: Tokyo brings inspirations from the horror genre into the open world, finding great success with this combination. Despite its hiccups, Ghostwire: Tokyo is another compelling experience from the mastermind behind Resident Evil.","An unfocused jaunt around Tokyo’s unnecessarily open world will provide for a solid way to while away the hours, but don’t expect the nail-biting survival-horror experience that Tango Gameworks is known for as you pound the pavement ticking off boxes.","Ghostwire: Tokyo will provide fun experience for horror games lovers with solid gameplay and good variety for its imaginative enemies. However, we can't help but feel the game is a bit forgettable overall.",Shinji Mikami relies on the talent of Kenji Kimura to offer something different and refreshing within the studio's catalog.,"Ghostwire: Tokyo is full of wasted potential. This insanely detailed, beautiful and atmospheric vision of the Japanese capital is lost to monotonous combat and gameplay.",Quotation forthcoming.,,"Ghostwire Tokyo is a good game. It nails atmosphere and looks next-generation on the PS5.There’s clever use of the new controller options. But when it comes to video games, gameplay is ultimately everything and this title simply won’t blow you away.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is a very deep experience full of great ideas. The way that Tokyo was build, combine perfectly with it's ghost story, open world and combat system.","Really, everything about Ghostwire: Tokyo is amazing, and it makes me glad I own a PS5. There aren’t many games just justify going out and buying a system for, but you could make a pretty convincing argument that this is one of them.","Ultimately, Ghostwire: Tokyo's world-building, Japanese folklore, and character dynamics are engaging, but the pacing and combat weigh down the middle section.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is a brilliant experiment in the clash of style and substance. Tokyo exists as an open world reminiscent of older games whose design may now feel ancient. Yet Tango Gameworks infuses nearly every aspect of the journey with a new, weird twist that no developer has thought to do before. Combat is striking and frenzied, even if it never reaches true complexity. And while the side content and the story may falter in their variety, enough praise cannot be heaped on the handling of Japanese folklore and the devotion towards cultural expression. Ghostwire: Tokyo may not be for everyone but I guarantee there is something in it for every single player to love.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is a shooter unlike anything I’ve ever played before. Its depiction of Japan is frighteningly lifelike in its execution, begging for us to explore its abandoned streets and dimly lit alleyways in search of wayward spirits that all have stories to tell. Whether you’re bounding across rooftops or doing battle in construction sites, it is constantly surprising in ways that few games in recent memory have managed to. It is fresh, exciting, and a demonstration of what a major studio is capable of when they’re given the freedom to tackle a new universe without compromise. It isn’t perfect, but it’s so different, and that should be more than enough for people to take notice.","Ghostwire: Tokyo feels like a throwback to a different era of action game design. It takes an off-beat approach to world design, story encounters, and combat pacing that won't be for everyone, but if you can get it to click into place you'll have a resoundingly chill time hunting ghosts throughout Tokyo.","You’re going to have fun with this game. For the criticisms I list above, I do think that Tango Gameworks has, with guidance from Bethesda (no doubt), created a refined and highly playable open-world game. It’s one that ticks all the boxes and does so in such a way that’s hard to actively fault. Yet, it's also so frustrating. The hints of what the developers wanted it to be are there. They wanted to make a Noh-inspired, yurei-and-yokai drenched blend of Shinto, Buddhism and neon-modern Japan. That would have been incredible. Sadly that didn't happen. Instead, I was left with the impression that I’d just played a Ubisoft Goes To Tokyo farce, and that left me feeling very deflated indeed.","Ghostwire: Tokyo has a unique combat system, fantastic narrative, and a recreation of its titular city that is intricate and immersive, even if it feels a bit empty at times.",,"At times it feels like the game’s incredible art direction, music and visual style deserve a game that’s better mechanically, but when it all comes together, Ghostwire Tokyo is one of the more unique games in the triple-A space, if you can ignore its gameplay stumbles.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is a game that makes no effort to define itself with specific premises and, paradoxically, it ends up being what catches you the most.",An unusual spellcasting system and many interesting references to Japanese folklore make Ghostwire: Tokyo a unique experience that’s worth your time despite the game’s disappointingly small variety of enemies and their poor AI.,,"Ghostwire: Tokyo isn't for everyone, but it gives us a glimpse into what Tango is capable of, and I hope they push the envelope a little further next time.","Ghostwire: Tokyo’s biggest problem is that it takes very few chances. Unfortunately, the gameplay is just too familiar for its own good. It’s got a great premise, and I loved its version of Tokyo. However, the story and setting are in a framework that’s all too familiar. It also has a hard time figuring out whether it wants to be a linear or open world title. Despite these issues, it has a compelling story, and I enjoyed the journey from start to finish. It’s great seeing an accessible AAA title like this utilize Japanese folklore as its inspiration and shows just how far we’ve come from the 90s where JRPGs were downplaying those sorts of things.",,"Explosive combat, fun activities and a beautifully realised city makes GhostWire: Tokyo stand out as a truly unique experience.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is not a bad game. I was interested enough to stick with it and engage with as much of it as possible. If you have more patience for open-world exploration and tedious collectable-finding than I do, then you might get more out of it. I didn’t go into detail about this, but the story is decent and well-told, and that counts for something. This game is also bursting with visual flavor and interest, the kind of which you won’t find elsewhere. But the majority of the game is spent in that open-world formula. Clear fog, gather items and souls, turn in for XP and money, do sidequests and tasks for that area. It’s all in the service of filling a percentage bar, and it just gets boring after a while. No matter how pretty or interesting the surroundings were, once I got well and truly stuck in the rut, I honestly stopped noticing.","Ghostwire: Tokyo’s open world city is beautiful, and its world-building, environment and creature designs are also excellent. But even with a sensible runtime and a brisk plot, the game spends too much time engaging you in repeating, unchanging, and unexciting activities. It’s the terrible and taxing curse of open world monotony, plaguing a piece of work that otherwise has so many unique and original ideas.","If you like games that are fast-paced and that don’t bog you down with gameplay elements that can feel like busywork, Ghostwire: Tokyo may not be for you. If you don’t mind the slower pace, however, and are excited by the prospect of busting ghosts with magic thrown from your hands, chances are you’ll love it. It may feel like virtual tourism during a cataclysmic event at times, but that’s the charm of it. And there’s plenty of it to be done as you traipse back and forth across Tokyo trying to thwart a Hannya mask-wearing psycho.","I didn’t know what to expect with Ghostwire: Tokyo at first. It uniquely meshes aspects of horror and action with the deep mythos of Japanese folklore. The game absolutely crushes it in terms of visual and technical performance, utilizing every feature of next-gen on the PlayStation 5. However, its disappointing narrative and repetitive open world features hold it back from being truly amazing.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is a gobsmackingly gorgeous action-horror with enemies that you won’t forget any time soon, not only for their eclectic appearances but their formidable ferocity in combat too. It’s a moreish game, and I want to trawl through every inch of this odd facsimile of the capital city, though I hope that Tango Gameworks rolls out an accessibility settings update to allow even more fans to enjoy this glittery and ghostly game.","Ghostwire: Tokyo looks stunning throughout, with impressive enemy designs and interesting locations, despite a few issues with its gameplay.",,"Ghostwire: Tokyo is a thrilling paranormal rollercoaster with ups and downs. Exploring the city of Tokyo is fun and defeating your first few enemies is a blast, its flaws also become apparent very quickly. The game lacks enemy variety and the same goes for Akito's weapon arsenal. Ghostwire gets a little repetitive and sadly doesn't find a way to fix that problem before the credits roll.","A unique game, set in modern Tokyo but full of references to Japanese folklore, yokai and oni. We love exploration and side missions, designed as small ghost stories, but combat mechanics are too basic because of the limited enemy AI.","Where Ghostwire: Tokyo loses some love is in the overall imprecision of its movement and mechanics, and a few elements that seem arbitrary or unexplained. Ghostwire: Tokyo’s combat is engaging and its environments are impressive, but that same combat can also frustrate and the environments are balanced against less impressive character models. As a new IP or franchise, Ghostwire: Tokyo is a great, but rough-around-the-edges step in a really interesting new direction.","Ghostwire Tokyo shines for its setting and development of its protagonists, although it abuses narrative that does not contribute much in its final episode. The work at the level of creating a desolate world has been perfect by Tango Gameworks. The main problem of the adventure is that it is halfway between genres.",,"From story to combat, exploration and setting, every little detail stands out and combines to deliver one of the best games of the year. Ghostwire: Tokyo is a true love letter to Tokyo and Japan, with all its peculiarities and mythology treated with well-deserved deserved respect, delivering a unique experience that can only be created by a studio truly in love with a project.","Ghostwire: Tokyo really surprises by delivering a perfect balance of horror and action. It Exceeds initial expectations, and makes you feel more fear than expected thanks to the great transversal work of the Tango Gameworks team. With a nice gameplay, although not much in-depth, you'll find yourself in the midst of an incomprehensible chaos that will make you fall in love with it when unraveling it. Finally, the title will give you the best thing in a work of horror: not feeling momentary fear from an animal survival instinct, but a constant fear that makes you restless when you close your eyes before going to sleep.","In the end, Ghostwire: Tokyo will satisfy that weeb-y curiosity when it comes to Japanese folklore while also giving you a fair bit of busy-work to keep your playtime high. Its overall gameplay is pretty solid, the story is above average when it comes to games from Bethesda-owned studios, and the feeling you get when you reach that points of unease can hit you like a ton of bricks, even if it does get repetitive from the second you capture your first set of lost spirits and send them off to Ed.","Ghostwire: Tokyo doesn't tap into all of its potential. There's nothing wrong with it per se (save for some repetitiveness) but there's nothing really unique about it either. Maybe except the visuals? It looks really nice, and all in all, it is a sturdy, by-the-book game with mediocre gameplay.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is a unique blend of FPS, RPG, and horror with a creative twist on how we approach fighting in an FPS. Despite a few grievances about the length and ambition of the project, it is still a good game, but unfortunately it merely toes the line between good and great, never quite finding its footing. Still, Ghostwire: Tokyo is well worth picking up.","Despite my perceived flaws of Ghostwire: Tokyo, I'd still recommend it as something to experience to players of all levels, simply for the fact that I did enjoy playing it and learning from it. Also, I wanted to give respect to Tango Gameworks for heading in a somewhat different design avenue. It's a ghostbusting romp through Tokyo, and if someone asks if you want to play it, say yes.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is bursting with originality and also looks great. However, that can't prevent that typical open-world game routine creeps in towards the end of the game.","Ghostwire Tokyo is such a well-rounded game that it's clearly one of the best titles so far this year. The combat, the progression, the way in which Japanese folklore is introduced and the design of the scenarios are the strongest points of an experience that is easy to recommend.","A compelling concept and a beautifully realised world, Ghostwire: Tokyo leverages Japanese folklore and a unique combat system to provide a unique open-world experience. While some aspects of the combat feel underdeveloped and the game structure has been done-to-death, Ghostwire: Tokyo’s uniqueness helps it stand well above where you’d expect it to.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is a beautiful and eerie jaunt through the streets of Japan, coming face to face with lore and legend while fighting for your own quest and purpose. With seamless gameplay and fighting mechanics, 40 hours of exploration will seem like no time has gone by and it will leave you wanting more time running the glistening streets of Shibuya.",Ghostwire: Tokyo is now representative of games that have been severely damaged by an open world.,,"You will fall in love with Ghostwire Tokyo's visuals. The way Tango Gameworks designed the city of Tokyo and the ghosts that wander around it is amazing. And gameplay is pretty fun too. But, if you compare it to some of the main releases of the year, it is not enough. Maybe because the developers did not have time to create something really unique. This is a good game, but it could/should have been a great one.",,"The story is there just to make you mildly interested in the game, which is kind of disappointing. Such an interesting world truly deserves much more exposition and deeper characterization of the cast, but if you’re looking for these traits in Ghostwire: Tokyo, you’re not going to find them. What you’ll find though is an interesting eerie world and lots of Western-like gunplay where you’ll be using your fingers to spit out psychic abilities rather than bullets, and that’s perfectly fine.","Ghostwire Tokyo is a pretty good game, entertaining, but it shouldn't be unforgettable. Artistically, it is very beautiful, the city of Tokyo is pleasant to explore but gameplay mechanics do not follow and are a bit outdated.",,"Ghostwire: Tokyo brings a unique world bursting with atmosphere, making Tokyo a pleasure to explore. The entire game is steeped in Japanese folklore, giving it a unique twist. Thanks to the battles and engaging characters, Ghostwire: Tokyo is worth a purchase. The combat can feel a bit limited in the long run and technically it's not perfect, but we'll look past that with love because the core of the game is so cool.",,"Ghostwire: Tokyo feels like a step back from what Tango Gameworks has produced in the past. While its combat system is fun in bursts, it becomes repetitive far too quickly. The open world is jam-packed with busywork, and the story doesn't go anywhere interesting either. Excellent PS5 DualSense controller support, haunting elements, and nice visuals aside, Ghostwire: Tokyo will have to go down as a miss.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is a great addition to the Tango Gameworks catalog. Its handling of Japanese mythology, main characters and side quests make exploring this haunted city something special to experience. However, the game had some monotonous combat and character movement that felt heavy and odd at the same time.","This quest for the future of a cursed Tokyo is unfortunately a little bland, accompanied by a silly story and a combat system that feels too easy. If you like your Japanese mythology and eastern religions, however, this might just end up being a real treat for you.",,"Rarely has such a big budget game been based on such a thin gameplay premise, with this bafflingly dull first person action adventure that begins to run out of steam by the end of the tutorial level.","Tango Gameworks' video game proposal will be a milestone. Without ever reaching perfection, Ghostwire Tokyo marks the spirits. The 1:1 scale reconstruction of the Japanese capital, the exploration of a supernatural and urban open world as well as the ethereal combat system alone are worth the detour. Admittedly, the story is sometimes set back and a certain feeling of repetition appears at the end of the course, but these few flaws are compensated for by the very singularity of the work imagined by Shinji Mikami and his teams. Ghostwire Tokyo is indeed that long-awaited memorable trip.","Most potent of all, there is a strain of urban fear running through its design—not of monsters but of the city itself as an isolating entity, rendering you unreachable.","Ghostwire: Tokyo’s vision of Shibuya is eccentric and captivating. Exploring every nook and cranny to learn more about the Japanese myths and legends that inspired the game makes for a compelling gameplay hook. It’s a shame that despite some interesting ideas, parts of the story campaign feel like they were left on the cutting room floor.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is the game I think we were all hoping for when it was announced. The eerie streets of an empty Tokyo draw you in and promptly scare you senseless with some fascinating enemies lurking around every corner. The story shines exactly when it needs to and then fades into the backdrop, allowing you to experience this sensational world. From the incredible voice work and writing, to the well-paced combat and city exploration, this is a must-play experience with plenty to do across its 20 hours.","Ghostwire Tokyo is another great addition to the PS5's growing library and we'd definitely recommend experiencing it. It's not perfect, but there's more than enough to keep you engrossed as the city slowly expands and offers more to explore. Between a gallery of ghouls, exciting combat, and a stunning recreation of Tokyo to wander through, it stands alone as something unique. Plus, you can pet dogs - what more could you ask for?",Shinji Mikami's latest game is an engaging and mesmerizing trip into Japanese horror folklore.,"Ghostwire: Tokyo turns out to be a huge disappointment. Despite its fascinating setting and its interesting plot, the open-world-gameplay turns out to be boring and monotone. The overall game lacks variety and depth.","Ghostwire: Tokyo has an interesting setting, but a lackluster story, monotonous combat, and disappointing visuals make for a forgettable adventure that doesn't justify its next-gen-only status, or the full asking price.","If Ghostwire Tokyo does not escape the ""one more open world"" syndrome, this is almost its only default. If the general structure is undeniably classic, the environment is fortunately much less so. The districts of Tokyo are faithfully represented, and exotic for us Westerners, while the morbid supernatural bestiary from Japanese folklore really does not lack charm.",,"Any story may have been exorcised, but Ghostwire: Tokyo's collection of Japanese mythology, plus the potential for exploration, will spirit you away. [Issue#13, p.82]","GhostWire Tokyo is at its best when you lose yourself in its universe. It's a love letter to Japanese folklore and ghost stories, and even when the open world and combat become repetitive, you never get tired of exploring the streets of Tokyo.[Recommended]",,"Mediocre combat and tiresome activities hold back Ghostwire: Tokyo's otherwise spectacular, otherwordly atmosphere.",,,,"Perhaps the kindest thing I can say about Ghostwire: Tokyo is that it’s an endearing experience. There’s a lot of care on display, from the cultural detail in the sweet side stories to the rendering of the rain-swept world itself. But whatever charm there is gets bogged down by frustrating design decisions and sluggish mechanics. It may be a captivating setting, but Ghostwire: Tokyo is difficult to recommend to all but the most devoted students of Japanese culture.","The moments in-between -- especially those the game deems most critical to plot and progression -- may not have the same punch, but Ghostwire: Tokyo though briefly just about shines through where it matters. A journey you will actively and quickly decide against sprinting through.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is, heartbreakingly, not spooky. It's also not particularly interesting, and I certainly didn't find it very fun to play. I'm sure genre-fanatics will find something to latch on to, but nothing ever quite hooked me enough to make the journey feel compelling.","Ghostwire Tokyo is a great adventure that manages to deliver a unique experience and shows true love for Japanese folklore. Even though some aspects like the combat and the story can be improved, we have enjoyed every second we’ve spent playing it.","While it still has room to grow, Ghostwire: Tokyo is truly a one-of-a-kind experience thanks to its breathtaking atmosphere, gorgeous open world, impressive stories, and exhilarating combat.","Ghostwire: Tokyo was not the game I was expecting from Tango Gameworks, but I definitely enjoyed it. Blending magic-filled FPS action with Japanese mythology and an open world Tokyo that reminds me of the Yakuza series, it stands out from the crowd even if it’s not truly groundbreaking. Ghostwire has a lot of potential as a new franchise and I’m looking forward to seeing what Tango Gameworks does with it next.","Ghostwire: Tokyo blurs the line between the first-person shooter and horror genres. It blends the two so naturally with the help of excellent level design, interesting characters, clever mission types, and some tense action. I had a great time exorcizing the streets of Tokyo. There are some growing pains in the opening chapters, but this game opens up in some bold ways that will keep you engaged until the final yokai is vanquished.","Ghostwire: Tokyo has a unique ""modern ghost"" cultural setting, but the tedious open-world design dilutes this feature, leaving the gaming experience repetitive and monotonous. The boring battle experience and dull main storyline will down its rating from ""worth a try"" to ""not very recommended"". Of course, for players who love Japanese ""oni"" culture and various urban legends, or who don't feel repulsed by checklist-based open-world games, this game is still worth watching.","A smaller, more condensed open world hides the ethereal reality of a game which has a touching narrative, beautifully conceptualised neon Tokyo to explore and a wealth of folklore tales to weave your way through. Ghostwire: Tokyo stays true to the well-worn formula of open-world games, but the genuineness of its ideals make it a compelling and at times, other-worldly experience. Find the time for this next 2022 gem. It deserves it.","Ghostwire: Tokyo mixes unique ideas with formulaic design, and though the latter does affect the experience, it is ultimately still a solid, enjoyable game that's well worth experiencing.","Tango Gameworks' latest outing won't scratch that survival horror itch the same way The Evil Within does, but Ghostwire: Tokyo has more than enough going for it to warrant at least one playthrough. A creative skill set keeps combat fresh and engaging even if enemies aren't the most in-depth when it comes to challenging the player. Exploration is enhanced by parkour-esque platforming that makes navigating in first-person a thrill. Tokyo is a moody, lonely setting dripping in atmosphere at all times. Level design is perhaps too restrained when it comes to eclectic set pieces, but the open world packs itself full of secrets while pacing its main content out appropriately. Ghostwire: Tokyo is a worthy entry in Tango Gameworks' catalogue.","Ghostwire Tokyo is a good game, with an interesting combat system and a very peculiar atmosphere, enclosed in a bland open world. We would have gladly preferred a smaller/linear map in exchange for more interesting contents and missions. Luckily, cast and main missions won't disappoint those looking for a fun weird story full of phantoms and shinto stuff.","It was a real pleasure to send the Yokai back to their world. Ghostwire: Tokyo certainly has evident qualitative yields, sometimes leaving room for a certain playful and content redundancy, but as a whole it has a charisma that we believe deserves to be rewarded, either for the evocative reconstruction of Tokyo, or for the presence of a gameplay as simple as it is compelling, you want the attention paid to the writing and symbolism that characterize the stories of the city. Myth, folklore, irony and existential drama are then amalgamated in an adventure that has been able to prove to be a pleasant surprise.",Ghostwire Tokyo pays tribute to japanese folklore and criticizes the contradictions of society. it deals with existential themes and tells a story of loss and resilience.,"Ghostwire: Tokyo offers a lot of good but it’s hidden behind even more tedium. I'm left wishing that the team had more time to polish their ideas, so it's hard for me to recommend Ghostwire: Tokyo. That isn’t to say I didn’t have fun with what's well made. What doesn’t, though, feels like a patch was thrown on instead of fixing the larger issues, which ultimately bogged down my experience.",,"The gameplay won't let you down, and the combat never feels lacklustre but, unfortunately, Ghostwire's story isn't what I hoped it would be.",,"Ghostwire Tokyo has some weaknesses, but with its fun to play combat and the beautiful presentation of Shibuya and its “visitors”, it will definitely pique your interest.",,,"Ghostwire: Tokyo is an impressively bold step in a new director for Tango Gameworks, and it pays off beautifully. Tango’s artists and designers are working wonders with zany and menacing creatures, set against the wonderful backdrop of a colour-struck Shibuya. While its leading pair and open world design stumble at times, Ghostwire’s wonderfully weird side stories and engrossing combat, more than pick up any slack and work in harmony with the game's more zany and offbeat elements to create a world that hasn't just got looks, but one hell of a spirit, too.",,"With superb visual design and an incredibly well-realised rendition of Tokyo, Ghostwire gets a lot right, but just doesn't quite have the gameplay chops to push it over the top.",,"When it comes to presenting an accurate and impressively detailed version of Tokyo, Ghostwire makes a great first impression. Despite literally being a ghost town, the city feels alive and captures neon-soaked pop-culture as well as ancient mythology and folklore. The two main characters deliver a convincing performance, too, and their story is entertaining, despite being quite short. Everything else, though – the combat system, the progression and the quest design – is the bare minimum of what’s acceptable from a big budget open world game. The combat, while fun to a degree, is especially thin with just three laughable spells and enemies without any special tactics or weakpoints. The unlockable upgrades are boring and unoriginal and the side quests, while having interesting setups, are mostly short and lack satisfying payoffs. Still, there is fun to be had in exploring ghost-infested Tokyo – it’s just not a creative, unique sort of fun, but rather a pretty mindless and extremely familiar one.","If Ghostwire: Tokyo appeared bewildering in promotional coverage it’s not because it’s unlike any other game so much as because it’s like so many all at once. Mechanically unfocused though it may be, it still earns stripes through sheer dint of atmosphere.","After watching the credits roll on Akito and K.K.’s journey, I still find myself itching to finish up every single thing in Ghostwire: Tokyo. Pray at those last few Jizo statues. Find the remaining tanuki. Figure out how to get inside of the 24th floor of the shopping complex so I can take out its pesky corruption spot. I’m forty hours in and counting and one hundred percent willing to do it all over again.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is a memorable journey that never overstays its welcome. With a unique combat system and plenty of options for exploration, it makes an admirable effort to keep players engaged even after the credits roll.",,,"When Ghostwire: Tokyo capitalises on its spooky surroundings by whisking you off into strange dimensions, fighting evil with powers you shoot from your hands, it’s excellent. The haunted, deserted Shibuya is a thrill to explore, and helping spirits with their final requests provides some engaging mini-adventures. Where it fumbles slightly is in the delivery of its open world, which regularly feels a bit old school as you chip away at the fog of the map, cleansing fast travel points as you go and repeating some filler tasks. Still, with a curious mystery laid out before you and a creepy atmosphere that will keep you on your toes, Ghostwire: Tokyo provides plenty of spooks and intriguing diversions around every corner that are just begging for your attention.","Ghostwire: Tokyo offered Japanese developer Tango Gameworks a chance to mix things up after the first two The Evil Within games, and the result is an open-world action adventure that definitely has its moments. Unfortunately, those moments come together with some missed potential and a lack of truly fleshing out all of the ideas presented. In the end, Ghostwire: Tokyo is a good game—but one that could have been something more.","Atmospheric, pretty ego trip through a Tokyo full of spooky creatures - with an open game world according to scheme and expandable shooter mechanics.",,"Ghostwire: Tokyo is a title that astonishes with its proposition. An open world horror game that knows how to blend these genres. Hundreds of activities to do, with an emphasis on showing us Tokyo from a ghostly point of view.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is an interesting new mix of horror 'shooter' with excellent enemy design and aesthetics, but relies strongly on its eastern thematic to stay interesting past a certain playtime. However, despite the repetition, it does it's best to offer enough to keep players invested and interested enough with its variety and story, especially if you have even a slight interest in Japan or its vast mythology.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is a game that we greatly enjoyed. Unfortunately, Tango Gameworks' approach was to create a game where style is dominant and little substance is offered. In terms of setting and art design it is one of the most unique games we have seen in a long time. However, it is a bland and run-of-the-mill title gameplay-wise.","Ghostwire Tokyo is a peculiar and charismatic open world, with a rewarding combat system and a fascinating location to explore.","Without being catastrophic, the result is unsatisfactory in almost all areas, and we are saddened to see so many good ideas badly exploited, and with wasted potential. The combat system is original but badly balanced. The atmosphere is intriguing and the city has a real verticality, but it is completely flooded with repetitive fights and items to collect. The narration could have saved the whole thing, but it quickly stumbles, and ends after only a few hours without giving any reason to be interested. The direction is equally inconsistent, with significant ups and downs. If instead of investing its limited resources in a failed open world, the studio had focused on the rest, maybe Ghostwire Tokyo would have been a good game.","I fully expect some people won't be smitten with the game the way I am, and I think it's completely understandable if you don't want to forgive the game for that. But if GhostWire connects with you, I think it'll really connect with you. It's weird and unique, and I think it's great to see this kind of game get this kind of budget, put it all on the table, and use that money to do some baffling and great art. And for that alone, I can't help but love GhostWire.",,For those that like the supernatural and action-adventure games you’ll have a great time with Ghostwire Tokyo. If you’re coming into it expecting a terrifying horror experience you’ll be disappointed but there are still moments there that will get under your skin. Bethesda’s PlayStation swan song might not hit all the right notes but it still delivers a melody that’ll be stuck in your head for a while.,"Ghostwire: Tokyo envisions a world that is wonderful and interesting to explore at first glance, but soon reveals itself to be shallow and lacking in its writing and combat.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is a game that fails to live up to its potential, trapped by a lack of ambition and an uninspiring old-school open world. The audiovisual presentation is good, if flawed, but on its own it can't elevate a short and monotonous game. A pity.",,,"Ghostwire: Tokyo ends up being a satisfying experience. With a wonderful world to explore, excellent combat that gets quite deep over time, and an interesting story, there’s a lot to recommend about it. Somehow it also ends up feeling a bit incomplete, though. There was room here for more gameplay variety and to really explore more with some of these characters, and doing so might have turned a good game into a great one. As is, the ending feels like it comes a bit out of nowhere, leaving me to wonder if the team's original vision was a bit larger. Still, if you’re looking for a creepy game where you strike fear into the creatures that go bump in the night, check out Ghostwire: Tokyo.","With plenty of fun and engaging diversions across its expansive map and a polished narrative that draws you into the plights of its compelling protagonists, Ghostwire Tokyo makes an impressive impression for a new IP from Tango Gameworks.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is an odd but thrilling adventure that mixes action, horror and Japanese traditions. Exploring a demon-filled Tokyo is decently frightening, while the battles are both intense and somewhat original. Some repetitive moments and an uneven story lower the experience a few notches, but in the end, the positive parts outweigh the bad ones.","GhostWire: Tokyo has managed to present a realistic Tokyo atmosphere with its basis based on Japanese folk tales, and despite its shortcomings in storytelling, it has managed to be a fun action-adventure game.",There are plenty of action and horror games on PS5 that give you a much more varied experience and are paced in such a way that the engagement will last throughout a full runtime. Why Ghostwire: Tokyo couldn’t do that will always be a mystery.,"Ghostwire: Tokyo could have been something really special, but Tango Gameworks misses the mark. There's a ton of work put in the creepy atmosphere of the game. But things get boring very quickly with very repetitive gameplay and frustrating combats. A true missed opportunity.","Ghostwire: Tokyo stands out with distinct elemental combat that feels fun to perform, and great care has been put into its haunting urban settings. The story and tactics lack development and variety in later chapters, but it’s still worth exploring Tango’s spooky rendition of Tokyo.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is a horror-themed shooter that features a cool, ghostly premise and a lavishly rendered open-world Tokyo. However, it doesn't provide many scares or particularly engaging action.","It’s a little bogged down in video game chores in the open world. However, when you’re on the trail of the main quest or any given side story, Ghostwire: Tokyo is a compelling adventure worth seeing through to the final spiritual release.","Despite its awkward pacing, one-note combat and tedious open world collectible hunting, Ghostwire: Tokyo is as unique and atmospheric as they come. Side-stepping its horror roots, Tango Gameworks delves into the depths of Japanese folklore and urban myth through the lens of the modern world and the results are as refreshingly charming as they are routinely unnerving.","Ghostwire: Tokyo doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to open-world games, but its unique setting, tremendous attention to detail, and singular combat make it stand out amongst its contemporaries. The story stumbles and not all of the side missions are particularly engaging, yet these aspects are easy to push to the back of your mind when you're using finger guns to tear through corrupted spirits with dazzling aplomb. Shinji Mikami is a legendary director, but taking a backseat and letting new voices come to the fore has paid off.","In the end it’s interesting because even though there’s thematic weight and meaning behind all of the open-world elements, they never really come together in a way that feels in-line with the smooth hand movements of Akito and KK performing a charged up elemental attack. Disappointing combat, lacklustre progression, and way too many collectibles-to-find aside, the Tokyo you get to explore serves as an impressive and memorable backdrop for a supernatural tale. With some great cinematic storytelling across the main narrative and the many side-missions you discover, Ghostwire: Tokyo becomes more than the sum of its parts.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is by no means a perfect video game. Ultimately, I was less interested in the story than the city it takes place in. I never quite found myself with skill points left unused, but the benefit of using them didn't scale particularly well as somewhere after level 20 it became increasingly incremental at best. And while it took much longer than it has for me historically, the game's open-world nature did eventually wear on me and I found myself skipping more optional content than at the start. It is, however, a perfectly fine video game, and an excellent example of what the PlayStation 5 can do in the right hands.","As a brand new IP, Ghostwire: Tokyo shows a lot of promise with its strong animation work, solid combat and interesting world design, but it falters along the path to the finish line with a story arc that feels rushed along with an excessive use of typical and tired open world game design tropes.","Ghostwire Tokyo is essentially what I thought it would be, for better and for worse. It's charming but empty, ambitious but too formulaic, and it's got the most personality of any game I've played this year. I sincerely hope Tango has more Ghostwire in store, either as DLC or a sequel. Despite its issues, there's nothing else quite like it.",,"Ghostwire: Tokyo is a good open-world adventure that wishes it was a great scripted horror story. The game is at its best when it straps you on rails and breaks down reality around you, but all too often you’re left to wander an empty Tokyo with little to say for it.","Ghostwire: Tokyo is at its best when it's reimagining Japanese folklore in visually astonishing ways and delivering moving visualizations of what it’s like to pass on. It’s less compelling as a checkbox-driven open-world game, with limited content stretched too thin across its apocalyptic version of Shibuya.",,"The big challenge that I felt from Ghostware Tokyo was how much it stuck close to very deliberate and slow pacing throughout. But I'm glad that I stuck with it, as Ghostwire Tokyo is a game that offers an intriguing and oddly personable world to explore, despite its eerie and unsettling nature.",,"As games get bigger and longer, more bogged down by an increasing need to have all of your attention, experiences like Ghostwire are becoming increasingly rare. Already this year, we’ve seen the creators of Pokémon and Dark Souls release amazing new games that demand an incredible amount of your time and energy. Ghostwire, meanwhile, has elements of open-world and role-playing games, but they don’t overwhelm the core of the experience. Instead, it deftly balances all-out action with quiet exploration and wraps it all up in a world full of fascinating, sad, and hilarious stories to uncover. It may freak you out, but it also respects your time.",,,,,,,,"Ghostwire: Tokyo is a fascinating and very worthwhile new title from Tango Gameworks. While there’s plenty of room for improvement in the main narrative and in establishing its antagonists, the content of the side missions ensures the game remains interesting throughout. Its ability to transport players into its supernatural Tokyo is not to be understated, and uncovering the different Japanese spirits while helping those unable to move on gives the game a thoroughly engaging loop that is hard to put down. In an already strong gaming year, Ghostwire: Tokyo is another title absolutely worth investing time into.",,,,,,,"I’d love to see what the initial vision for Ghostwire: Tokyo was, before former creative director Ikumi Nakamura’s sudden departure from Tango Gameworks, because what we ended up getting feels like the shell of a different, far more interesting game. A rendition of Shibuya that’s authentic, atmospheric, eerie, and brimming personality deserves better than the most banal version of a generic open-world formula that ran out of steam a decade ago. Despite all the potential in its concept, the Ghostwire we got is—despite its ghostly theme—soulless.","This is basically an open-world first-person shooter that’s visibly inspired by and using a lot of the toys from survival horror, and it doesn’t quite manage that fusion with grace. However, Ghostwire is charming, interesting, and creepy enough that I’ve enjoyed my time with it.",,,,,,,"Ghostwire: Tokyo is set up to be one of the most unique and interesting titles of the year, and it doesn't disappoint. Darken the room, turn the volume up loud, and keep out any distractions; Ghostwire: Tokyo is one hell of a spooky ride.",,,,A compelling story steeped in Japanese folklore is enough to overcome the repetitive battles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asterigos-curse-of-the-stars,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Very few indie games have quantity and quality that can match those of triple A titles, but Asterigos: Curse of the Stars definitely makes the cut. This is an outstanding first project from Acme Gamestudio and I can’t wait to see what’s next for them. What you’ll find here is a polished narrative-driven Souls-like adventure held back only by some frustrating design choices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Asterigos: Curse of the Stars is a game composed of two different genres and not fully committing to either. Doing so makes it not reach the potential I think the game could have had by sticking to simply one. Still, with fun combat and an explorative world, it is a solid experience. One that many gamers will be satisfied with but forget after the holiday season.",,,,,,,"Asterigos: Curse of the Stars offers an enjoyable formula with exploration and combat that'll keep you hooked as you forge your way ahead. With that in mind, it could certainly use a clearer sense of direction even if it was implemented via an accessibility option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A solid soulslike, with some cool ideas in the combat. Despite a few technical flaws and some less-than-original takes, Asterigos is still worth your time. [Issue#21, p.89]",,,,,,,,"Asterigos: Curse of the Stars combines the style of traditional RPGs with a soulslike template, resulting in a challenging but more accessible game that’s able to forge its own identity without hiding its influences. The final result isn’t perfect as there’s plenty of room for more polish. Despite these shortcomings, the gameplay is still enjoyable and the emphasis on storytelling and world building helps make up for it. The biggest divisive factor with Asterigos is that it tries to appeal to both fans of more traditional RPGs and Souls games by combining elements of both, and as a result doesn’t excel at either. But if Asterigos is approached without a purist mentality it can still be a good time.",,,,,"Are there already much better games of similar gameplay style out there? Absolutely, but Asterigos can still surprise you if you’re after something different and far less punishing.",,"Acme Gamestudio has delivered an incredible debut with Asterigos: Curse of the Stars. If like me, you’ve been suffering from Souls-like burnout, this might be the game for you. It’s gorgeous to look at, constantly engaging and an absolute joy to play. Asterigos is not just one of the best indie games I’ve played this year, but one of the best, most complete games I’ve played in a long time, indie or otherwise. It’s an outstanding, honest-to-goodness adventure made with love, sincerity and attention to detail. It is incredible; play it.","Asterigos has some promising aspects when it comes to gameplay, but the game feels sorely lacking in the technical department.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Asterigos: Curse of the Stars is a triumph, a title of such confidence and quality that it feels like the work of a veteran studio, rather than a studio trying its hand at the genre for the first time. With a truly flexible combat system, an engaging and deep narrative, and a gorgeous visual style that makes the most of its Greek and Roman inspirations, Asterigos: Curse of the Stars easily overcomes any minor criticisms that can be raised against the slightly lacking level design and quality of life issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The developers take a brutal and punishing game of survival and spin into an epic journey. Hilda won’t become a beaten and battered casualty of a brutal combat system, but rather a heroic figure that brings hope to a bleak land and its people, with personal stories that have a variety of endings for the Aphesians in this fully fleshed out world. A strong combat system that doesn’t punish players too harshly makes Asterigos: Curse of the Stars refreshing and approachable. Levelling too much can make bosses easy, and locations for quest items can be obtuse, but the game never feels unfair or unbalanced making Aphes a world worth exploring for the rich adventure that it tells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bugsnax,,,,,"Bugsnax leans heavily on the unique nature of its titular creatures, and it succeeds by doing so. They’re cute, they’re creepy, and their existence makes no logical sense whatsoever. Armed with a bit of design this indelible, the developers could have phoned in the rest and raked in the merchandising money. Instead, they fully committed to delivering a narrative worthy of the creatures starring in it. It was a risky choice, but it was also a daring and clever one, and that’s exactly what it wants to be.",,,"We should have expected nothing less than this level of surrealism from the developers of Octodad: Dadliest Catch. Bugsnax is about as weird as they come. Yet, underneath all the cutesiness, strangeness and edible bugs there is a surprisingly deep, heartfelt storyline with a mystery worth solving.",,,,,"A performance cleanup thanks to PS5’s added juice coupled with some well-implemented usage of the DualSense controller means that Sony’s newest console is the best place to play Young Horses’ second indie offering, and it ensures that we’ll be ‘talkin’ ‘bout Bugsnax’ for a while yet.",,,"Beyond its rather ugly aesthetic (so it's not really going to bring out the capabilities of PS5), Bugsnax has been a fun and original game that you arrive at by capturing its more than 100 Bugsnax and you stay for the story and character development.",,,"With a repetitive quest structure, too many loading screens, and a sense of humor that might not be for everyone, Bugsnax is not a game with the universal appeal its cutesy characters might suggest. That being said, the game’s absurd world and creatures are utterly charming and unique, and the wide variety of bug-catching mechanics are exactly the kind of evolution I had been hoping Pokémon would make for at least 10 years now.",,,"It’s just a shame that the core gameplay here is so dull. Everything else in Bugsnax would make it a strong GOTY contender, but the sheer repetitiveness of the game’s main task drags it all down. Still, given how high the rest of the game flies, there’s only so far down it can go — and as it stands, that still means you’re left with one heck of a game.",,,,"Bugsnax will be remembered for its brilliantly-crafted world, characters and titular Bugsnax for many years to come, despite some repetition and frustrating load times.",,,,,,,,,,,"While the concept behind Bugsnax is fun and whimsical, the game comes up short in its execution. Hunting for the many different types of walking food begins as a charming exercise, but quickly devolves into a slow grind as you work to find out which of the game's many tools will solve the next tedious puzzle.","As cute and clever as its creatures are, the puzzles just aren't deep or interesting enough. Still, I don't dislike Bugsnax.",,"Bugsnax is a joyful, lovely experience from start to finish. With a surprising amount of heart, it'll hit you in the feels time and again - even when you're force-feeding snax down the throat of someone who'd rather keep them as pets (sorry, Gramble). It's the sort of game you can't help but play with a huge grin on your face and, long after finishing the main storyline, you'll want to return to Snaktooth Island to round up more snax and hang out with your new furry friends. You might not be a Grumpus yourself, but Bugsnax certainly leaves you with a fuzzy feeling inside.",,,,,,"Bugsnax in a narrative adventure with some interesting ideas, an unforgettable cast of characters, lovely designs and a great script... that fails as a showcase of PS5 technical power, with come trial and error loop in its gameplay that can be frustrating at times.",,"Bugsnax is the ideal game to play between long triple A, but is also one of those that maintains itself in your memories. The characters upgrade what could be a curiosity to a remarkable game.",,,,,,,,Finding and collecting the many Bugsnax is as much fun as discovering the island and immersing yourself in the lives of the Grumpuses. The result is a humorous and entertaining adventure that will keep you interested until the end.,,"Whether it’s the super-catchy theme song, the nostalgia-evoking gameplay, or simply the very basic fun of hunting new Snax to transform the Grumpuses, Bugsnax is a game that is well worth your time. Its simple yet addictive challenge of catching the cute yet strange creatures coupled with some wholesome storytelling delivers a well-rounded and fun adventure.",,,"In Bugsnax, the bugs are snacks and that's quite cool. Beyond that, its relaxing open-world objective-based gameplay is solid for winding down with after a long day but it doesn't really have much else going for it.",,,,,,"A surprisingly strong story carries you through this colourful adventure, that constantly manages to find new ways to keep the act of catching Bugsnax interesting. The graphics are a bit disappointing, though... but did that ever stop anyone from having a good time?",,"Bugsnax delivers a good time regardless of platform, but it excels on PS5. It benefits from much shorter loading sequences, improved performance, and the DualSense's unique features. All this makes for a more enjoyable excursion to Snaktooth Island. If you play Bugsnax at all — and you absolutely should — do it on PS5.",,,,An ambitiously odd game that has an innovative take on Pokémon style gameplay and features some of the most intriguing characters of the year - but is rarely as much fun as it should be.,"Bugsnax will leave a lot of players behind because of its hunting mechanics sometimes lacking in precision, or even by its assumed childish side and its strange artistic direction.",,,"Bugsnax is a delight in the most unexpected of ways. Despite its cartoonish and exceptionally goofy exterior, it’s got deep messages of community, relationships, and belonging. Though there are certainly missed opportunities for a bigger gameplay loop around catching the various Bugsnax, everything about Bugsnax is a joy, perhaps the reason that I wanted more from it. It may not be an obvious showcase of the PS5’s power and capabilities, but it’s certainly a unique game that shouldn’t be missed.",,,,"There may be a lot of games you want to try on the new PS5 console, but if you're looking for a palate cleanser between the bigger, flashier games, Bugsnax is the perfect aperitif to your next-gen feast.",,,"A perfectly portioned final course. Just as witty as everything that came before, with plenty more to chew on. Sometimes bigger really is just better.

While the act of capturing and eating Bugsnax is a frequent delight, the finer qualities of Young Horses’ latest outing comes in its story and characters. Underneath the otherworldly designs sits a beating heart of close-knit relationships and relatable issues I found myself growing immeasurably fond of.",,,,"Bugsnax is a light-lifting puzzle adventure that is elevated by its strong story and characters that I enjoyed until the very end. Despite some simple mechanics, the laughs outnumbered the groans significantly as I found myself surprisingly invested in the events of the island and its inhabitants. With over 100 Bugsnax to discover and catch there’s plenty here to entertain the completionists, alongside those just looking for a well-told six-hour mystery that will keep you guessing until after the credits roll. All of this while making you feel emotionally connected to the characters, something you previously might have thought sounded impossible. Until you saw a carrot crawl, that is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A simple-yet-fun game about collecting... weird, half-animal and half-food hybrid creatures: a Pokémon-style game that shines thanks to one of the best uses of DualSense and Game Help that we've seen so far on PS5.",,"Young Horses has created a silly but heartfelt story and adventure game, but the creature-capturing gameplay never really hits its stride.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you want to catch them all and check off the full list of side quests, Bugsnax takes about 10 hours or so to complete. The gameplay can feel a little clumsy here and there, but it makes up for it with the silliness and creativity of it all. There’s a lot of joy to be had with these bizarre critters, and there’s more to the story than you might guess. So if you’re curious about where this adventure ends up, pack your bags for Snaktooth Island, and be sure to bring a healthy appetite.",,,,"Unsurprisingly, Bugsnax' best qualities are its cleverness and charm. The surprise and delight you feel when you see a Bugsnak wiggling around or watch someone eat one and change their arm into food never goes away. That alone would make Bugsnax worth your time, but creative puzzles and thoughtful story give it the body and depth to make a Snak feel more like a meal.",,,,"Bugsnax is memorable for its writing, world, and creative premise, but its more gamified elements somewhat spoil a delicious meal. Bugsnax isn't the best version of the game it could have been, but it's still a really fun adventure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"While far from pushing PS5 to its technical limits, this is definitely one of the most delightful launch titles. Dial ‘D’ for ‘different’ to learn how you can begin your own Snaktooth adventure.

With one of the more unexpectedly interesting narratives I’ve come across in recent years and deeply inventive puzzle gameplay, there’s a lot to like here in a package that isn’t too short but also manages to not overstay its welcome. I made some great friends on Snaktooth Island and I think you will too, especially if you’re playing on the PS5.",,,"One of the highest compliments I can pay Bugsmax is that when the game warned me I'd hit a point of no return in the story and I'd no longer be able to complete any unfinished side quests, I panicked because I really wanted to finish them. Could I find a way to delay my review? Hmm. Sadly, my deadline for writing this piece, written in the midst of pandemic and election, meant that wasn't an option—I had to push forward. And so, reluctantly, I did.",,,,,,,,,,,"It's a lovely little puzzle game with a darkly relatable underbelly, driven by a story that distills modern society and the human experience of 2020 into a colorful parable.

powerwash-simulator,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For a game that should not be fun, PowerWash Simulator is very addictive. The 'ding' you get when each piece gets cleaned is so satisfying and rewarding, as is seeing a massive area go from being dark brown and dirty to shiny and new. In a world of very similar games that fail to offer anything new, PowerWash Simulator achieves this with aplomb and makes me happy for future unique titles. There's nothing quite like this game on the market and that in itself means you should give it a try.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"PowerWash Simulator is the type of game that you sit down to play for 15 minutes, then realise hours have gone by. It may not be full of intense action or have a rivetting story, but once it’s got its hooks in you, it’s hard to break free. The desire to clean just one more object is strong. Still, it’s an acquired taste: it does simply have you undertaking menial jobs after all. But if you like stress-free games and don’t mind repetitive tasks, the reward of making things look shiny and new is considerable.",,,,,,,,,,"If you are the kind of person that can sit down and appreciate a job well done after finishing house chores, you just might find an enjoyable pastime in PowerWash Simulator.

A cooperative mode would mitigate this situation, but the way it's been implemented is far from ideal, unfortunately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Where we fall slightly out of love is with the fiddly controls. It packs a lot of useful functions onto the controller but it took us a while to figure it all out, and the tutorials are so minimal that some features barely register. It's also a shame the DualSense's capabilities are wholly ignored; this seems a perfect game for all its tricks. Even with any small reservations, though, we can't deny the game is just as engaging, relaxing, and enjoyable as everyone says.",PowerWash Simulator is a game that goes beyond its simple premise to be quite an entertaining and sometimes complex experience that can keep you hooked for hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If what you want in a game is a simple, relaxing cycle that doesn’t require more from a player than their time and doesn’t offer much more than the enjoyment of playing it and the satisfaction of completion, Powerwash Simulator might be perfect.

raiden-iv-x-mikado-remix,,,,,,,,"Raiden IV x Mikado takes one of the best games of the famous Raiden series and gives it a fresh soundtrack. It's not going to do much that the PS3 version didn't do, but it's a solid example for the genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The reality for Raiden IV x Mikado Remix is that hardened fans of the series probably do already own this game in one form or another already. In some respects, this is just a late port, and a slightly odd one given it’s gone from the lower-powered Switch to the PS5 (as reviewed), XBX and PC. If you do already have it, while this is a nice take with some great music choices, it’s hardly essential...If you don’t, it’s a very good shmup, if not one of the most complex out there in terms of gameplay mechanics. You’re still ultimately chasing a high score and not much else – and I didn’t appreciate that the default high scores were set pathetically low, because I’d rather have something to chase from the get-go. Still, I am a bit of a Raiden tragic, so in that frame at least, this is definitely a top game – for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’re a shoot ’em fan, there’s no better way to play this classic.

heavenly-bodies,,,,"The resulting sense of forward momentum helps keep the frustrations from growing tiresome. [Issue#367, p.114]",I greatly enjoyed my time with Heavenly Bodies and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys these types of physics-oriented titles – It’s a wisely-tuned spaceborne experience that does exactly what it wants to do and does it well. Mission accomplished.,,,,,,,,"Much like Manual Samuel and other titles of that ilk, Heavenly Bodies certainly feels tailor-made for the streaming scene. With its penchant for generating knee-slapping laughs and red-faced moments of white hot anger that are both best enjoyed with friends and in front of a captive audience (not to mention the speedrunning mode that would arguably garner a fair audience), 2pt Interactive have certainly crafted a commendably enjoyable co-operative yarn that should last well into the holidays and beyond.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Even in the frustrating moments when the controls seem to have it out for you, there’s so much to like about Heavenly Bodies. It’s a wonderful concept for a game, it’s impressively polished, and it’s hyper-focused in the best way. It feels like the devs took their time. While it may be a struggle, it’s a fun struggle.",,,,,,,,,,,,"One of the latest indies surprises of 2021, an enjoyable game that recreates the aesthetics and some situations of the space movies of the 70's with tons of sympathy, that you can also enjoy in local coop. It's not very long and have some control issues, but it's so funny that you will forgive almost everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Heavenly Bodies is not your average cup of coffee, not even for indie games. It has a very specific audience it set its target on and delivers on its promise of challenging players through the control system. Visually and atmosphere wise it is clearly inspired by the classic, realistic sci-fi movies. The game itself is pretty short, but due to the control scheme, you will spend quite a lot of time even on the simplest tasks. Heavenly Bodies is not for everyone, but those who enjoy this kind of games will have a blast with it.",,,,,"Push past this, and you'll find a cleverly designed set of challenges that shine best in co-op. While things can quickly spiral if you're careless, completing objectives feels like a real triumph, and each mission scales things up, providing new ideas along the way. Once you have your head wrapped around it, Heavenly Bodies offers up wonderfully tactile puzzles, and the DualSense is really put through its paces. The game is rather short, but it does give you more to do after beating each mission. We should also mention there are three levels of control available, with the easiest allowing you to ""swim"" through the air (or lack of). While we do think there's a good time to be had here, be aware you'll need some patience to find the fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The novelty of grappling with gravity has never been this fun or challenging. A gorgeous, if demanding, patience-tester that makes every manoeuvre a thrill. [Issue#10, p.80]",,,,,,,,,,,,"A brief fumble in the darkness of space, Heavenly Bodies is designed to beguile you with floaty, physics based puzzles. It will scramble your brains as you perform the most straightforward of tasks, at times testing your sanity and (if playing in co-op) the strength of any relationship.",,,"Combining the awkward unforgiving nature of space with a short and focused puzzle exploration game, Heavenly Bodies succeeds in what it sets out to achieve. It’ll frustrate you, impress you, drive you mad and blow you away with its mechanics and 70s aesthetic. You might not always have fun playing it, but this is a Zero-G trip worth embarking on, smashed controllers and all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Heavenly Bodies deploys a fantastical movement system and clever puzzle design in service of a decent enough time on your own but probably deserves to be experienced with a friend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hot-wheels-unleashed,,,,,,,,"A fun arcade racer that provides added value for those willing to get their hands dirty. However, those who just want to race might find the experience a limited one. Buy into the whole creative side and it’ll make you feel like a kid again, especially if you’re the type that likes to collect.",,,,,"Hot Wheels Unleashed is an excellent arcade racing game with some truly inventive and crazy tracks, wonderfully recreated Hot Wheels toys that drive beautifully and the visuals to back it all up. Unfortunately an imbalance of reasonably long to extremely long tracks and their many hazard risks make it too easy to get frustrated when struggling to reach top spot, and the track builder while very well detailed fails to make the user experience anything but pleasant.",,,,"Hot Wheels Unleashed has everything it takes to become a cult hit: a fine driving experience, a story mode, a track builder and you can unlock and collect rare cars. More than that, it's the racing game we didn't know we needed this year.","Hot Wheels Unleashed is, at times, a dream come true. Milestone has managed to capture the essence of Mattel's toys with a complete title full of content, a fantastic editor —that will give a lot thanks to the community— and a complex driving system where drifting is fundamental. Despite some improvable physics and design decisions based on random content and gambling (loot boxes), the result is more than remarkable, satisfactory and, therefore, recommended for fans of the genre. In addition, the performance of its online mode has surprised us for the better.",,,"Hot Wheels Unleashed is one of the most entertaining racing games of the year and a love letter to fans of this franchise. Without a doubt, an unmissable entry.",,,"‘Hot Wheels Unleased’ is as close as you can get to a kid’s dream (or at least mine). There are some slightly clunky things like the track builder at first, but once you get past the learning curve you’re able to set sail and take the wheel. It handles like a dream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It may be based on a particular brand of die-cast toy cars aimed at kids, but Hot Wheels Unleashed is a fun arcade-style racer suitable for all ages and, for the most part, skill levels. Bursting with content, it’ll be a while before you’ve grown tired of its many tracks and unlocked all of the 60-plus cars that it offers. Throw in online and offline multiplayer, a track builder, and gameplay that’s easy to pick up but has some additional depth for more skilled players, and you have a package that’s easy to recommend.",,"All-in-all, Hot Wheels Unleashed is an incredibly fun racer which will get its hooks in you and have you behind the die-cast wheel for hours on end. It includes a comprehensive track builder which you can use to let your imagination run wild and an extensive car collection which will keep your eyes firmly on the plastic orange track. It's the ultimate virtual Hot Wheels experience, whether you want to create your most fantastical Hot Wheels tracks, or just race long into the night playing split screen or multiplayer with a friend. There really is something for everyone here, and Hot Wheels Unleashed is a welcome addition to Mattel's long-running Hot Wheels video game franchise.","Not only a blast of die-cast nostalgia, but a brilliant arcade racer to boot with superb customisation options.",,,,"Hot Wheels Unleashed is a fast-paced racer that captures the frantic action of the miniature, diecast toys. The momentum-based gameplay helps to create intense races where anyone can win or lose. Even though the tracks are exciting and varied, the lack of environments is disappointing. Vehicles look incredible, making you want to collect each of them, however, the grindy blind box system may halt your progress. Overall, this is a solid racer that will knock you over with a nitro-boost of nostalgia.",,"Even with an outstanding Hot Wheels license to work with, Hot Wheels Unleashed’s generic and uninspired execution coupled with lower presentation qualities makes it a below average racing title.",,,,,,"Hot Wheels Unleashed is perhaps the best stand-alone game to use the license by far. It nails the feeling of racing with tiny die-cast cars and melds it with a presentation that looks far better than what you'd expect for a licensed title. The race variety is lacking, given the presence of only two race types, but the track variety greatly makes up for that shortcoming. It may have flown under everyone's radar, but Unleashed is worth everyone's attention.",,,,,,Hot Wheels Unleashed is an okay racing game at best. If you want a much more enjoyable arcade-style racer with your favourite childhood toys then check out Beach Buggy Racing 2: Island Adventure which has its very own Hot Wheels Booster Pack DLC.,,,,"For a first draft from Milestone on this license, this Hot Wheels Unleashed is doing with a positive result. This is mainly due to a well-studied drive and rather well-designed circuits that respect the spirit of small friction cars. Once the driving is mastered, it is fun to go from boost to boost, studying the best way to use nitro and optimize trajectories. We can hope that this constitutes an encouraging basis to make it a real must-have on a future version. There are unfortunately too many flaws that reveal an imperfect finish.",,"Hot Wheels Unleashed is initially a pretty fun arcade racer, with decent controls, as well as a nice connection between soundtrack and gameplay. After a while, the game starts to get tedious, though. Uninspired tracks, annoying enemy AI and a large amount of filler content ultimately prove Hot Wheels Unleashed's downfall.",,"Hot Wheels Unleashed is a rock solid arcade racing game that gets a lot of things right, but doesn't quite measure up in some areas. The drift-heavy handling and physics-based mayhem create super fun action on the track, and the cars themselves are as good to look at as they are to drive. While the tracks tend to feel a bit samey and the random nature of unlocks may lead to some frustration, the end result is a robust racing game that'll appeal to fans young and old.","Hot Wheels Unleashed brings to consoles the same feeling that we had when we played with the toys in our childhood. The variety of vehicles is wide (even when there aren't many legendary ones), and both the cars and circuits work well. Overall, this is a great arcade racing game and a great surprise.","This is a surprisingly well done, fun racing game, full of thrill and fast toy cars. It’s highly addictive, the car designs are adequately crazy and there’s a robust editor to satisfy your creativity.","If you're a fan of arcade racers, Hot Wheel Unleashed is a fun game for a rainy weekend. However, the game has little to do with the basics of Hot Wheels. Collecting the coolest cars is also hell because of the available Blind Boxes.",,"It remains an effective game, quite enjoyable and is without doubt the one that most faithfully respects the spirit of the famous brand, with that same nostalgic and passionate vision that we could have had ourselves, a few years earlier.",,,"Despite some balancing issues and some issues with how cars are obtained, Hot Wheels Unleashed is still a ton of fun thanks to its breakneck-speed racing, a detailed track editor that would make your inner child jealous, awesome collectible cars, and packed single-player content. Add in the nostalgia for playing with Hot Wheels cars and tracks as a kid, and you might find it to be one of 2021’s hidden gems.",,"Hot Wheels Unleashed tries to bring back the memories of childhood with a fast and colored game. Unfortunately it does not succeed completely, resulting too simple and repetitive.",,,,,"While everything is perfectly playable, for a game that absolutely nails the toy’s aesthetic it’s almost remarkable how removed the gameplay feels from the fiery, fast-paced action that has come to embody the brand. Never mind hot, these little wheels are lukewarm at best.

Thankfully, the quality of the core game is good enough to largely overcome that handicap, but it would be a far better experience with rebalancing in that regard down the line. The racing action is fast-paced and thrilling, with strong sound design that helps make up for a lackluster soundtrack. Hot Wheels Unleashed is a fantastic pickup for anyone who grew up wanting a fleet of Hot Wheels cars — and that aspect will get better as time goes on with content packs.",,"Hot Wheels Unleashed is a fun arcade racer, with plenty of options and that old-school gameplay that feels great if you miss this type of game.",,,"Hot Wheels Unleashed is really nice to look at and sometimes fun to play, but I’m not sure who it’s for. The in-game currency model is unnecessarily convoluted and annoying most of the time. The difficulty is unbalanced to the point where I was forced to play on easy and swallow my gamer pride. The online multiplayer is where the most enjoyment is, but expect to invest hours trying to pull a car that can compete with some of the rarer racers. If Unleashed were a contender in a race, it would place 12th, like I did many times.",,"Hot Wheels Unleashed is how you make a toys-to-life video game. Milestone have taken some of the finest collectables and made them photo-realistic, unleashing them on racetracks that will blow your mind with the level of detail and craziness in equal measure. Exemplifying the “kart racer” genre, it is the natural progression of why we fall in love with this type of racing game over and over. This is a love letter to both Hot Wheels and arcade racing fans.","Hot Wheels Unleashed is a bit light on level and event type variety but still delivers a great racer worthy of the Hot Wheels name with plenty of speed, detailed customization, and a meaty roster of fun vehicles.",,"Hot Wheels Unleashed marks the return of toy cars to consoles and PC, with a noteworthy title.","Hot wheels Unleashed is, in some respects, a brilliant arcade driving video game. Simple, immediate, fun and just enough adrenaline, supported by an excellent technical department and which offers one of the best circuit editors that have been seen in recent years. However, it is not explained how such a well-made title can be inserted in such a cumbersome and counterintuitive menu system, in addition to the fact that in the face of an excellent interpretation of the Hot Wheels brand on an aesthetic level, it contradicts itself so evidently with the its management of the lootboxes, the underlying mechanics of the title that has influenced its internal balance in a way that is at least questionable.",,,,,,"Milestone awakes our nostalgia for the beloved Hot Wheels from our childhood with this extremely well designed, addictive and beautiful game.",,,,,,"Despite the phenomenal graphics and details, sim-specialized authors from Milestone stumbled a little bit while trying to make their trip to the arcade genre fun enough.",,,,,,,"Hot Wheels Unleashed delivers on what it promises, high octane toy car thrills, drifting and boosting around gravity defying tracks set in high definition great looking environments. It just lets itself down when it comes to the structure of the solo campaign and there aren’t enough unique hazards or variation in the tracks to keep you coming back for more. It would have been nice if they went a step further and thought outside of the box with the designs of the tracks themselves, but at least it delivers a boost of nostalgia for the kid inside all of us.",,,,,,,A tavern full of toy cars to have fun with thanks to a fun and clean arcade driving model.,,"In its best moments, Hot Wheels Unleashed feels like a rollercoaster, albeit with a greater ability to steer the action. These are the Hot Wheels tracks you dreamed of zipping through when you were a kid, ramping off buildings, or accelerating through your home’s air ducts. The breakneck speeds and delightfully silly tracks don’t make this incredibly sophisticated, but it’s one of the more amusing racers to hit the starting line in some time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hot Wheels Unleashed is a super fun yet sometimes frustrating arcade racer that is hindered slightly by some design shortcomings.,,,,,,,,"Outside of its stunning visuals, Hot Wheels Unleashed is a toothless kart racer, relying too heavily on nostalgia goggles and the Hot Wheels brand to carry it instead of the solid ideas that end up hardly being implemented. What players get with Hot Wheels Unleashed is the same experience I had with many of my Hot Wheels as a child; I was entertained for a few hours, then grew bored and tossed it in a box. That’s not to say that I didn’t have fun with the game. Those few hours were full of spectacle, because it’s simply impossible to not get caught up in the game’s sights and sounds. Eventually, though, it’s going to take more than racing a hot dog car down a strip of vinyl track to keep me interested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The overall feeling of Hot Wheels Unleashed is that it is a huge win for nostalgia fans and racing fans alike. From the graphical detail of the world to the tracks to the cars everything is spot on with how you remember these cars looking. The control you have while racing puts Hot Wheels Unleashed right up there with some of the other AAA racing titles.,"Honestly, I really didn’t expect much out of Hot Wheels Unleashed. I was expecting a throw-away licensed racing game. Perhaps, more cynically, a cash-grab targeting nostalgic aging gamers. What I ended up getting, though, was a surprisingly solid arcade racer by a team that obviously cares about the license they’re working with. It’s not without its quirks, unfortunately. The shocking aggressive AI racers created many moments of frustration, and I’m not a fan of the “gacha but not really” system going on here for obtaining new cars. But for fans of arcade racers, whether the Hot Wheels name strikes a chord or not, Hot Wheels Unleashed is a game worth a look.",,,,,,,"With more cars than you can shake a bit of plastic track at and a driving model that’s surprisingly good for an arcade racer, Hot Wheels Unleashed is an excellent racer that punches well above its weight.","The game is more like an arcade title than a full-featured racer. The game is clearly focused on collecting cars and expanding your collection rather than providing an extensive and full-featured racing game experience. The arcade racing is fun in short bursts, but the blind box system can make it feel like a grind while trying to obtain the cars that you want. If you pick this game up, do it for the car collecting. Otherwise, there are more enjoyable arcade racers with more variety out there for you to play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-falconeer-warrior-edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Falconeer: Warrior Edition is largely the same game that I already enjoyed when it first launched, but experiencing it on PS5 has made all the difference. The DualSense's features are well implemented, and the gameplay flows in such a way that you never want to put the controller down. Despite issues with the UI, and how certain aspects of the game work, you can just get around them, and can avoid them altogether once you've moved into the endgame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Falconeer: Warrior Edition includes everything released so far, with stunning visuals on PS5 and even prettier visuals than before.",,"The Falconeer already was a good flying action shooter with its very own graphical style and interesting storyline that spanned over 15-20 hours. With all additions packed in the Warbird edition, the game has expanded significantly and addressed several of the earlier points of criticism. If you're interested in guiding your own giant warbird through a wonderful fantasy realm (and who wouldn't?) this game deserves your attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, The Falconeer: Warrior Edition remains the very same game with an excellent atmosphere, beautiful visuals, but a gameplay that is not as engaging as we would have hoped. It is still a remarkable achievement for one man, and the game while not perfect it is definitely worth trying. Despite the fact that sometimes the pace is a bit off, due to the big empty traversal sections, and that the difficulty level can be inconsistent, soaring to the skies on the back of your trusted mount is a unique experience.",,,,,"What The Falconeer offers is a remarkable open-world-ish experience, one that's all the more impressive given that it's (almost) entirely the work of one person. It's gorgeous to look at and polished as all-get-out, with a warmth and sense of familiarity to the proceedings that reminded us of the Bullfrog classic, Magic Carpet. It's a game that's very clearly cared about, a game whose systems intermingle cleverly, and one that doesn't give up its secrets easily in the slightest. Does it offer the adrenaline you’d expect from the freedom to fly and fight atop an enormous war-warbler? No, not really. But it’s still pretty falcon good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A unique, atmospheric adventure with a character that it’s never less than a joy to control. Wondering feather or not to dive in? We say go for it.

It’s a game that says its piece in the first hour but then meanders on for another dozen hours without saying anything more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Not a perfect game but one that delivers some solid gameplay within a rich universe brought to life through an atypical artistic direction. The work of one man, Tomas Sala took the time to implement all the dual sense functionalities needed for this Warrior Edition on PS5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Falconeer is weird and wonderful with its surprisingly good sci-fi/high fantasy story and lore-ridden world. Despite its unusual and “out there” premise, it falls into the familiar and doesn’t do anything new with its gameplay. There’s a world worth seeing in The Falconeer and it really is an artistic piece by a passionate artist, but it feels like a piece of a larger picture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-sinking-city,,,,,,,,The Sinking City is a good Lovecraftian detective game with uprated PS5 visuals and massively reduced loading times from the PS4 version. Well worth picking up if you fancy something a bit different. Just a shame that haptics are underutilised outside the usual rumble.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The changes that Frogwares made are impactful and make this a significantly better experience than it was at original release. It still has its quirks, but the positives far outweigh the negatives and it’s easy to recommend this game to anyone who has yet to check it out.",,,,"This leaves the PS5 version of the game in a similar place to its original release. The Sinking City is one of those flawed but sometimes brilliant games that has a huge amount of ambition. It might not reach the heights of other recent cult classics like Greedfall or Vampyr, but its blend of cosmic horror and detective pulp is infectious.",,,,,,,,,,,,"The Sinking City was already an intriguing and worthwhile detective-thriller. But its PS5 enhancements have taken it to the next level. It’s a gorgeous-looking game, and roaming the ruined streets of Oakmont at 60FPS has never felt better. The combat is still a let-down, and more repercussions for your choices would be nice to see, but the freedom the game gives you to follow your own leads is second to none. Frogwares should be proud of everything it has achieved here, and it’s got me excited to see what its next game has in store for us.",,,"If you're looking for something action-packed you'll be better served elsewhere, but for fans of Lovecraft's universe or head-scratching detectathons, The Sinking City is more than worth a shot.",,,,"The Sinking City arriving on next-gen is a surprising yet greatly welcome arrival. With such a rich world and narrative, compelling investigative segments, and some truly horrifying features like experiencing hallucinations when your sanity meter drops, this was a title classic horror fans simply must try.","An interesting game that has some deep flaws. We love its story and the way you investigate, but the combat is plainly awful and we miss some more tutorial during the whole adventure. Also having to pay again for the same game if you already have it on PS4 doesn't rock.",,,,,,"There’s a lot to like in The Sinking City on PlayStation 5. With updated textures, 4K/60 FPS support, faster loading times, and activities support, it’s a solid detective story. While the combat may be shallow, and it has enough havok bugs to make a Deep One scared, it represents some of the best work Frogwares Studio has made. If you are an H.P. Lovecraft fan, don’t let this one sail past you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While it's great to see The Sinking City return to PlayStation consoles, the PS5 version does little to make this worth an additional purchase for existing owners. DualSense support and shorter load times are nice additions, but performance and gameplay are still on the rough side. For newcomers, the lack of direction in particular can turn the engaging story into a backtracking slog very quickly. There's a great and engaging detective game buried here, but there are much better offerings out there to scratch your itch.",,,,,"While it doesn't succeed in everything it sets out to do, The Sinking City remains a game that does not lack character.",,,"Frogwares is a master in mystery. While their pedigree is mostly rooted in Sherlock Holmes, this foray into Lovecraftian horror is an admirable effort made even better by the technology of the PS5. Loading times are vastly improved on The Sinking City PS5, and the game looks better than it ever has before thanks to improved textures, lighting, and resolution. This version is also free of Frogwares’ publisher drama with Nacon, and paints a pretty exciting picture for what the developer can do with mystery games on the PS5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Sinking City offers a very simple upgrade: higher resolution and frame rate, some additional visual effects and faster loading, as well as features unique to PS5, such as DualSense haptic feedback.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you can look past a plethora of bugs, backtracking and glitches, there’s an interesting game hidden here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Although the enhancements may be minor, The Sinking City for PS5 is the slickest and most enjoyable version of Frogwares Lovecraftian detective adventure to date.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
farming-simulator-22,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Easily the best entry in the long-running series to date, though Farming Simulator 22 might not have a picture perfect PS5 debut, it does augment the series already robust strategic and micro-management fundamentals with a number of new additions and features that make it an erstwhile choice for series veterans. Though newcomers will likely struggle with the tutorial and learning curve, Farming Simulator 22 soon becomes an engaging time sink that not only taxes the brain duly, but helps to provide a modicum of insight into the sheer amount of hard graft that goes into one of the most challenging occupations in the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Players of earlier Farming Simulator games will notice and appreciate a lot changes and improvements in the new release. Everything looks a lot better, there are new crops, and the new production chain mechanic and changing seasons really mix things up. New players may be flummoxed by the tutorial, as well as the deep, open-ended gameplay. Farming Simulator 22 has some rough patches, but there’s a lot of fun to harvest as well.",,,,,,"Farming Simulator 22 is the best installment of the series, but it's not perfect. Some issues could have been easily avoided, while others are clearly the results of choices. But we can be sure that mods will fix many things soon. Then the veterans of the series will love it.",,,,,,,,,,,"So at the end of the day, it’s hard to call Farming Simulator 22 a perfect game. It could be, and I’m pretty sure the mods will once again improve this great franchise in a way that Giants Software should study closely and keep in mind before the next version is launched. Yes, it’s just a matter of time until modders end up delivering this must-have polishing, but of course, this isn’t the right way to go for such a popular franchise.",,,"Farming Simulator features a huge list of vehicles, machines and more, to present farming life as complete as possible. GIANTS succeeds once again with this new part in the franchise. The multiplayer is fun, there is plenty to do, the integration of seasons is a valuable addition and we could go on and on. However, the tutorials could be better for newcomers and the world is a bit dead.",,"Farming Simulator 22 massively expands upon the management aspect of past games, giving greater importance to your crops once you’ve harvested them. Building supply chains is immensely rewarding, even if it can take what feels like an eternity to get your business up and running the way you want to. Interesting new crops, like grapes and olives, add gameplay variety to the tried and tested loop, while an abundance of licensed machinery gives you a wealth of vehicles and tools to work with. It’s the best entry in Giants Software’s series yet, but like a popular British yeast extract, you’ll either love it or hate it.",,,"Anyone with an unbridled love for the virtual farming, horticulture and animal husbandry of the Farming Simulator series will love this latest installment. The inclusion of virtually all major agricultural brands, combined with all available crops and animals, as well as superb graphics and sound design, provide an authentic farming experience that has clearly been crafted with great care and love. Please note that you are dealing with an in-depth simulation of farm life here. You have to figure out every function of a machine if you want to use it effectively and that feels, for the agricultural layman that I am, all just a bit too hardcore.",,"While Farming Simulator 22 will undoubtedly appeal to fans of the series, newcomers may feel overwhelmed by the possibilities. However, it would be a shame to miss this episode since it corrects most of the faults of the previous part. Vehicle modeling is always more precise and the arrival of the seasons or even production lines is a real plus. Now it's up to you to see if you are ready to immerse yourself in this experience, which is as complete as it is difficult to master.",,,"If you’ve been chomping at the proverbial bit, in preparation for Farming Simulator 22, most likely you are going to be extremely pleased with this outing. It takes the more surface-level mechanics found in prior installments and then builds upon them immensely. While it certainly has its fair share of issues such as terrible AIs and tutorials, which hopefully can be improved through post-release patches, this new level of depth helps drive the franchise well into the PlayStation 5 era. Using this year as a foundation, I can’t wait to see where the series goes in the future.",,"Farming Simulator 2022 continues the ten-year tradition of agricultural simulator, bringing some nice innovations but with little depth.","At its core, Farming Simulator 22 remains mostly the same.

cyberpunk-2077,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Off the top of my head I can’t think of another game with a backstory like Cyberpunk 2077. It’s fortunate that CDPR were able to spend the last year-plus continuing development of the game, listening to feedback, adding content, and fixing tons and tons of issues. Many games would simply not have gotten the extra time and money spent that Cyberpunk got, but this time CDPR got it right. Now is the right time to play this game; I’m not saying it’s flawless and perfect, but it’s nearly so, for such an elaborate, massive game. This is the game we were hoping for back in December 2020, but I’m reminded of the adage ‘better late than never.’ And that certainly applies here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cyberpunk 2077 on PS5 is the game that PlayStation fans should have been playing in 2020. While it still falls short when measured against the immense expectations that surrounded its release, everything that Cyberpunk gets right is so much easier to enjoy when the game isn't crippled by technical issues. The main story's a thrill ride, the combat's a blast, and Night City is an incredible open world setting. And the best part is that CD Projekt Red finally has a stable foundation to build upon. It took 14 months to get here, but the future of Cyberpunk 2077 actually holds a lot of promise.",,,,,"Thanks to its upgrade, Cyberpunk 2077 finally offers a gaming experience on PS5 and Xbox Series at the height of what it should have been at its launch in December 2020. More beautiful, more stable and better optimized than in backward compatibility : those who had waited for the next-gen patch will finally be able to enjoy the adventure in good conditions. But beyond these technical considerations, if patch 1.5 brings some welcome adjustments (more responsive crowd, improved but still perfectible driving and ergonomics...), the title remains globally identical to the PC version despite a less impressive visual rendering. More than a year after its release, Cyberpunk 2077 remains an RPG with a fascinating universe and impeccable writing that remains plagued by immersion-breaking bugs and an artificial intelligence that falls short. Now that CD Projekt has finally honored its promises, we can't wait to see what the Polish studio has in store for the future of its futuristic open-world with new DLCs.",,,,,,,,,,"Despite significant technical and in-play improvements for this PS5 version, much of the game’s core remains unchanged. Quest design and storytelling, though not without their moments on the critical path, too often feel rife with unrealised potential.

It’s certainly no Witcher 3. Still, for the first time, it feels like it’s crossed into the territory of a game worth getting lost in, with the potential for more polished additions in the future. In another universe, this was the original launch date for a much more feature-complete version. By contrast, in ours, Cyberpunk 2077 may finally be able to stand on its own feet as a solid gaming experience for those willing to give it a chance.",,,Cyberpunk 2077's native current-gen version is a slightly more polished version of a game that's still bogged down by significant issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite its mismanaged launch, Cyberpunk is a success story. What began in December 2020 as an incomplete, often-unplayable sore spot for CD Projekt has become one of the most immersive RPGs I’ve ever played – one whose visuals, soundtrack, and narrative can go toe to toe with the strongest in the genre. Despite Cyberpunk’s technical headaches, I’ve enjoyed more than 40 hours in it and don’t see myself losing interest in its rich world or side content anytime soon. Cyberpunk’s botched beginnings warranted the scorn players treated it with, but if patch 1.5 is any indication, Night City’s future looks bright.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-medium,,,,,,,"The Medium is a game with great potential and bad execution, as its issues and problems such as limited gameplay, easy puzzles and bad camera work eventually overtake its great story telling and engaging atmosphere.",The Medium is a linear experience with an interesting if underutilised split dimension mechanic. The story is complex but can also be predictable whilst not providing enough in the way of intrigue. Temper your expectations and you may just get something out of it.,,,,,"The Medium shines when it’s letting you soak in its beautifully crafted dual worlds and melancholic soundtrack, but early promise of a quietly effective ghost story unravels as the story staggers clumsily to a point where it becomes almost unbearable in its attempt to tackle a tough subject.","Despite some impressive DualSense implementation, the blemishes embedded into The Medium's gameplay and narrative still show on PS5. While The Medium is an intriguing horror game, it certainly isn't a great one.",,,,,,,,,,"The Medium on PlayStation 5 feels like the best version of the game and one worth trying if you have yet to experience it elsewhere. While its unique dual-reality perspective lifted the game up, players expecting an outrageously different spin on psychological horror may have seen these scares before. But it’s hard to deny that Blooper Team aimed for the fences with The Medium and payed homage to the classics while crafting a new universe that they may wish to refine further down the line.",,,,"Bloober Team meshes all of these elements together to draw players further into The Medium's world than the Xbox/PC versions were capable of, elevating an already enjoyable experience to new heights. It stands to reason that the PS5 version of The Medium is the ideal way to experience Marianne's dual-reality adventures, and PlayStation 5 owners that enjoy horror games should definitely check the game out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Medium on PS5 is as good as it was on Xbox Series X, however, with DualSense support it becomes a much more immersive game.",,,,"With each game they release, Bloober Team continues to make strides, and The Medium is another such step. It has an intriguing story with intriguing characters. The game also has a nifty mix of old and new gameplaying elements.",,,,,,,"The Medium proves to be an interesting look into the human psyche, one that attempts to figure out why individuals are the way they are, while still stating that your past does not excuse your current actions. I greatly enjoyed my time in Marianne’s shoes, and found myself constantly impressed with the incredible graphics and unique mechanics. Bloober Team has made an impressive product, even more so on the PS5 with their willingness to make use of the PS5’s controller’s special features.","Bloober Team is no stranger to making games that feature concepts with immense potential, like Blair Witch or Observer. The Medium is probably my favorite of theirs to date. It's got a couple of warts, but it's easy to get lost in its world (both of them), even with its pitch-black narrative overtones. It makes it feel important, though perhaps not something you'll feel compelled to play on repeat.",,,,"With a story that’s just okay and controls that make you want to pull your hair out, the great audio and voice acting are overshadowed. Watching someone else play it would be the more satisfying route to experience The Medium.",,"The way that The Medium brings trauma to life in various ways is awe-inspiring. At the same time, it's not all that good of a video game.",,,"All in all, The Medium is a good game, but not revolutionary and certainly not the new king of the genre. The story and atmosphere will stay with you long after finishing it, but the gameplay has a lot of room for improvement. If you prioritize a good story and a masterfully crafted atmosphere The Medium will not disappoint.","Now on PS5, The Medium is the same game players could have experienced on Xbox and PC. A strong narrative and the concept of twin worlds make it a pleasure to discover, even if it feels a bit simplistic. DualSense make it a little bit more immersive, even though technical hiccups can be a bit frustrating.",,"The Medium tells an interesting paranormal story and allows you to explore an environment that’s as creepy as it is fascinating. On top of that, it looks and sounds great. However, you’ll have to endure the sometimes clunky camera angles.",,It could very well be the best psychological horror experience on the console.,,,,,,,,"The Medium is an admirable horror experience from a developer that has been making a lot of huge strides for itself in the world of horror game development. It’s not something that is going to change the world of horror games, but it does enough unique things with the simultaneous dual-world mechanic to stand out. Like many horror games before it, it fails to balance its tension with certain gameplay mechanics that can turn from fear to frustration pretty quickly, but these are spaced out enough that it never ruined the experience wholesale. For any horror fans looking for a Silent Hill-esque game to fill that ominous void, The Medium will at least scratch that itch.",,"This edition of The Medium is suitable for those who have not had, in the past, the chance of recovering the title in the Microsoft or PC ecosystem. This is perhaps not the best of the ports, but the new features related to DualSense and the generic good quality of the product can fully justify the purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This is the same experience that we know, now with a correct implementation of the DualSense that doesn’t really add anything too exciting.",,,,,"The Medium surprised me with its psychologically twisted, complex and intricate story that had me enthralled from the moment the intrigue turned into something more sinister and personable. Even with its simplistic gameplay design and clunky encounter mechanics, the atmosphere of the world and enjoyable tale should carry you through even its darkest corners. In the real world, The Medium would be basic, but in the spirit realm, it comes to life and will show you the disturbing but enchanting fabric of its reality.",,,,"Also on PS5 The Medium confirms the strengths and weaknesses of a production that is at times also genuinely intriguing, but unable to distinguish itself and to sanction that consecration of the Polish studio that many would have expected (even more so with what seemed to be the project of maturity definitive). The experience is essentially identical to that which lived seven months ago on the Xbox Series X, with a big difference, indeed in practice two. Even without epochal revolutions, on PlayStation 5 the DualSense adds something in terms of interaction compared to the original version, but on the Microsoft console the inclusion of the game in the Game Pass catalog since day one weighs a lot: a download to The Medium yes can and if you are a fan of the genre you must give it without reservations, while the investment of 49.99 € must be taken less lightly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mechanically and in terms of storytelling you get the same experience on PS5 like on the other platforms. The newly added DualSense functionality feels out of place, though.",,,,,,,,,,,"The Medium on PS5 is pretty much as good as it was on Xbox Series X, despite some graphic flaws and loading issues. Luckily, the DualSense features manage to fill the gap.",,,"The game's arrival on the PlayStation 5 has been a long time coming. But thankfully, it was well worth the wait. With its unique dual-world gameplay mechanics and gripping narrative, The Medium is yet another macabre masterpiece from the talent at Bloober Team. If you have even a passing interest in horror games or are looking for a powerful supernatural story to experience that isn't afraid to touch on sensitive subjects, this is one game that demands a spot in your PS5 library.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Medium lands on PlayStation 5 after seven months after its launch on Xbox and PC ready to take advantage of all the technology of the new Sony console to bring its peculiarities to this horror adventure that will keep you at the controls for a good handful of hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
beyond-a-steel-sky,,,,,,,,,,"Beyond a Steel Sky is a typical modern adventure game with old-school logic puzzles mixed into it. With great writing from some of the great names from the comic-book and video game industry, it is riddled with linearity, lack of player choice, and irritating puzzle design in the later parts of the game. Still, it poses a fun experience for all fans of the genre, and due to its great world design, it is a true cyberpunk experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Beyond a Steel Sky is an impressive adventure game with an intriguing story and a fun hacking system that adds a layer of challenge. As you play, you'll constantly wonder what situation you'll face next and what chain of events you'll have to complete while you're there.",,,,,,,,"The 3D environments just don't have the same magic, either. Beyond a Steel Sky's visuals are basic, and its locations are all a bit sterile. And that's a shame, because at its core, this is a heartfelt and often charming video game. If you're an adventure fan, Foster's second foray into Union City is fun enough while it lasts — but it struggles to be anywhere near as memorable as the classic titles that it draws from.",,,,,"Faithful to its predecessor, Beyond a Steel Sky is a success on consoles. Taking advantage of the 4K resolution and fully dubbed dialogues, this version puts the player in an armchair. More stable and comfortable, the adventure turns out to be pleasant thanks to the impactful writing, colorful characters and a city more surprising than ever. The lack of life is however glaring and may hamper those looking for a spectacular setting.",,,,,,,,,,"A game like this lives or dies on its script, and the writing is excellent, supported by some great acting. [Issue#10, p.86]","That Beyond a Steel Sky is coming to consoles after its release last year on PC is good news. The less positive points like the simplified chat system are still there. However, the simplicity of its control, the good use of the track system, and the graphic modes available in the reviewed version of PS5 make it a title to take into account within the current scenario.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Beyond A Steel Sky is easy to recommend to anyone who would like a low stress mystery puzzle narrative adventure game. Although a sequel, the game does an excellent job of catching you up on previous events and you won’t feel out of the loop of the storylines. I hope this is a series that continues on. Although sometimes a bit slow in places with minor bugs, it’s an engaging world and story to be a part of, with creative puzzles and fun throughout.",,,,"Although it is difficult to turn a blind eye to the defects of the technical sector, whose use of the Unreal Engine 4 seems really naive, the production of Revolution is still distinguished by a grandiose, inspired and suggestive artistic direction, as well as a narrative fluency that will satisfy even the finest palates.",,,,,,,,,,,,"The long-forgotten point & click classic Beneath a Steel Sky finally gets a sequel that takes us back to a completely different time in many ways. After many years, Revolution Software is demonstrating that they are still able to create an exciting story based on old fears about the future that are even more relevant today than before. Even new players who are not familiar with the previous instalment will get a very well-rounded story and experience, but they will still have to invest a little more than in other today's derivatives of the once-popular genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Coming 27 years after its predecessor, Beyond a Steel Sky inevitably lacks the originality that made Beneath a Steel Sky such an instant classic, and a strong source of inspiration for many games that came later. Union City is now a 3D world, but it’s still filled of clever puzzles and interesting characters, shaped around Cecil and Gibbons’ view of society. It might not be as groundbreaking as the original, but Beyond a Steel Sky is still a good adventure that tries to offer a perspective on our society and how we should try to improve it without leaving anyone behind.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Built by veterans of the genre, Beyond a Steel Sky may not be a revolutionary adventure game, but its clever writing and intriguing story make it a solid entry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
demon-turf,,,,,"Demon Turf doesn’t rewrite the rules of 3D mascot-style platformers. Its design is standard fare for the genre and I had some issues with the camera, but the visual style remains one of the strongest I’ve seen in any game all year. In an era where so many titles are visually indistinguishable from one another, it’s nice to see an indie try something new and wow me on visuals alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Although I’m sure completionists will find a lot to love here, I had the most fun with Demon Turf when I forgot about its myriad side quests, collectibles, and second visits to a level, and just ran through stages with my mastery of Beebz’s moves letting me fly through levels like I was Sonic and I’d finally learnt how to work in 3D. When Demon Turf is fast, it’s glorious, it’s just a shame it has some extra baggage stopping it from peeling out.",,,,,"Demon Turf looks fantastic and its platforming mechanics are brilliantly satisfying, but it's let down by boring combat and occasionally confusing level design. It's still worth a look, but it's not the best.",,,,,,,,,,"Ultimately, you’ll get most out of Demon Turf if you’re an ardent 3D platforming fan. There’s a lot to like here thanks to the range of skills and interesting upgrades up for grabs, and the levels provide a good amount of challenge. It can get a little repetitive though, so you’re better off keeping your play sessions short and sweet. But lean into its wacky sensibilities, and there’s fun to be had.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Demon Turf is one of the best 3D platformers in recent years and it even rivals recent AAA attempts at the genre. With spectacular gameplay, a huge campaign that's brimming with replay value, clever gadgets, and a gorgeous presentation; it's the whole package.",,,,,,,,"While the platforming is largely very good, the game does have its drawbacks. The camera doesn't always give you the best view, and fights can be frustrating with imprecise projectiles and a lack of combative options. The boss battles in particular can be irksome things. Even with its flaws, however, this is a game offering lots of personality and refreshing, clean platforming fun.",,,,A 3D platformer which wears its inspirations on its sleeve but manages to offer enough individual style and unique platforming dynamics to stand on its own.,,,,,,,,,,,"The devil is in the detail in this demonic platformer. It’s worth mastering everything that’s asked of you – side-activities too – to experience everything. [Issue#8, p.92]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A slick, well designed game, Demon Turf is packed with personality, in part due to its 2D/3D hybrid visuals. Like a tour of the best the genre has to offer, this is a 3D platformer for those that grew up on them and fancy a hearty yet deeply rewarding challenge. It’s only let down by a handful of bugs which will hopefully get fixed via a patch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Demon Turf is a stylish and challenging platformer that brings some interesting ideas to the table. And while they may not all live up to their full potential, I can appreciate developer Fabraz taking a chance at shaking things up. If you’re a die-hard fan of the genre and are looking for something new to scratch that itch, Demon Turf probably won’t dethrone your favorite platformer. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t any fun to be had here. However, if you don’t fall into that category, you’ll probably want to consider hoisting your flag elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A stylish throwback to a couple of decades ago, this platformer will appeal mainly to those who still miss the Dreamcast. A few niggles with the camera, a couple of minor bugs and some rather harsh difficulty spikes stop it from being a world-beater, but it's a solid piece of fun despite these small issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
greak-memories-of-azur,,,,,,,,Greak: Memories of Azur is a solid puzzle platformer that is broken by the save system and crappy inventory management. We hope you like replaying sections over and again as you'll be well catered for.,,,,,"Simply one of the most enchanting art-styles you'll experience on an indie game. The hand-drawn characters and backgrounds are magical in motion, and contribute to a potently heart-warming playthrough. Whereas the game's simultaneous character control, puzzles, and individual character skills can be highly enjoyable at the right moments, those moments sadly don't come enough to completely satisfy. Nevertheless, Greak: Azur is worth a go for the aesthetic charm alone, and has some great puzzles for fans of that inclination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Greak is yet another great Metroidvania that manages to make the genre feel fresh and empowering. While the world of this story is dark, the feeling players are left with is one of joy, and its well-paced runtime leaves room for both a sequel and replay value.",,,,,"While Greak: Memories of Azur can be occasionally frustrating, the design and world-building are effective enough to make it worthwhile and enjoyable for players of all skill-sets.",,,,,,,"With a fairly short running time, at least Greak: Memories of Azur doesn’t require much commitment to see it through. I just can’t help but feel that if your companions were computer-controlled and actually assisted you in combat, or at least tried to keep out of the way of your enemies rather than simply standing motionless, my review would be much more glowing. As it is, for every few minutes of joy I had with Greak: Memories of Azur, I generally had another filled with some level of frustration. Ultimately that lead to a great deal of disappointment, which is a real shame.","I'm not sure what happened with Greak: Memories of Azur. The elements are all there. The ingredients in place to create something wonderful, and it does look stunning. But the execution is a complete let down. The promise fails to bind together because for every clever idea, every good intention, there is some frustration looming alongside. For every good bit there is something bad, and the end result left me feeling like the package was less than the sum of its parts.",,,,,,"Greak: Memories of Azur is a heartfelt, thrilling adventure. With three leading characters, the game has managed to carve its own identity within a crowded genre. The jaw-dropping visuals and intricate soundtrack ooze atmosphere, enticing you to explore every inch of the world. Although controlling several characters at once can be troublesome, it takes nothing away from this fascinating, methodically paced, puzzle-platforming quest about family, home and hope.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Greak: Memories of Azur is one of the most beautiful games out there with its captivating visuals and immersive audio. However, its gameplay is riddled with issues such as vague progression clues and clunky combat which make the experience frequently frustrating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Greak: Memories of Azur provided me the opportunity to experience a beautiful hand-drawn world in a way that best suits my gaming time and style. As I get older and find myself more and more selective with my gaming, intimate experiences like Greak are so much more rewarding than the biennial installment of a huge triple A title. Perhaps you’re noticing the same habit forming with your gaming. If so, this hidden gem might be exactly what you’ve been looking for, too.",,,,,,,"This all sounds great in theory, but things fall apart somewhat if you ever accidentally stray from the beaten path. The lack of a detailed map, even for areas you’ve already visited, makes navigation more frustrating than fun until you eventually stumble back on the intended route. And as the puzzles grow in scope as you progress, this issue becomes more stark. It’s not what we’d call a dealbreaker, but it’s enough of a nuisance to hold this short yet unique adventure from greatness. [Issue#6, p.81]",,,,,,,,,,,,"Greak: Memories of Azur isn't a bad game, but it is one that's got a few too many annoyances. Between aggravating enemies, the limited inventory, and the almost absent AI of Greak's siblings, it's an experience that is too weighed down by frustration to get a strong recommendation. However, if you like the look of the world and some cheap enemies and awkward controls aren't a dealbreaker for you, Greak is one of the best looking 2D platformers I've ever played and the world is interesting enough to keep you going.",,,,,,Greak: Memories of Azur is the good adventure of three brothers in a fairytale world.,One of the most beautiful surprises of this 2021.,"With its beautiful art direction, Greak is a journey you should embark on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Greak: Memories of Azur doesn’t necessarily set out to cut new ground when it comes to puzzling platformer adventures, but what it does, it does pretty well.",,,,,,,,,,,"Greak: Memories of Azur is a game with a good artistic direction, well-implemented mechanics, satisfying combat, and is full of details that show the affection with which it was made. The handling of 3 main characters and the puzzle solving are the most original touch of the game, while also taking influences from iconic works such as Hollow Knight and Ori and the Blind Forest to make it a better title.",,,,,,,One of the most intriguing action-platform games of the year.

darq-complete-edition,,,,,,,,"Darq is an incredibly atmospheric, if brief title about being a self-aware dreamer that is stuck in a nightmare. This game oozes spookiness with satisfying puzzles and Tim Burton-esque surrealism, but skimps on the actual horror elements which could have been its Darq’s marquee feature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Darq isn’t the most difficult puzzle game out there, but it does excel in all uniqueness categories. Its greyscale art style adds to its overwhelmingly gothic vibe while providing puzzles that are difficult enough to force you to pause yet easy enough to solve. It’s definitely something to check out, even if you won’t be challenged to the fullest extent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"DARQ may be short, but it’s the perfect length to ensure it never outstays its welcome. It uses clever puzzles and a fantastic atmosphere to draw you in, then challenges you just the right amount to keep you invested. The inclusion of the DLC makes the Complete Edition the best way to play, and if you enjoy a mind-bending and physics-twisting puzzler, you’ll love everything DARQ has to offer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you like horror adventure games, DARQ Complete Edition is definitely worth trying. If you played the game already, you can now replay it in its complete form with better framerates. If this is your first contact with DARQ, the Complete Edition offers the best experience possible. Still, it is hard to forgive the length, the lack of the story, and the fact that after you played or, replayed it once more, there is nothing more to do here. The atmosphere is special, the puzzles are well thought out, and the environment is very detailed, but each player has to decide for themselves how 2-3 hours of fun should translate into a price tag.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Because I’m much more inclined to play these sorts of puzzle platformers on a console over computer, DARQ has been in various wishlists of mine for some time. I’m honestly glad that I waited for the chance to play this on my PS5, not only because my old laptop couldn’t have handled it, but I feel that this complete edition is a polished final version and everything the developers wanted it to be. It runs smooth as silk, autosaves frequently, those scary moments have more impact when I witness them on a TV over a computer screen. DARQ Complete Edition has been such a positive experience for me that I’m excited to see what Unfold Games does next.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DARQ: Complete Edition is a disturbing title and for this reason also incredibly valid: you will fall in love with its puzzles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"DARQ: The Complete Edition is the perfect way to play this 2019 hit. With upgraded load times, an improved frame rate and the two packaged DLC levels, if you haven’t yet tried this melancholic puzzler, now is the time. Where the game falters in narrative building and sound design, it makes up for in snappy, addictive gameplay and an art style to both adore and be disturbed by.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s an intriguing game in concept, with an abundance of eerie atmosphere and some clever ideas at play, but it struggles to reach its true potential. If you like the sort of moody puzzle games that Darq follows in the footsteps of, the couple of hours you’ll spend in Lloyd’s dreamworld are certainly worthwhile, but this is a nightmare that, strangely enough, feels like it’s over too soon.",,,,,,,,,,,"DARQ: Complete Edition is a fairly priced package that offers up around 6-7 hours of puzzles and thrills, though the thrills aren’t all that thrilling. The horror is definitely missing but the cleverly constructed puzzles and the dark world of Lloyd’s subconscious carry the weight well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
monster-energy-supercross---the-official-videogame-5,,,,,,,,"If you want to get your supercross/motocross hit, then this game is the way to do it with its officially-licensed riders and tracks but it barely improves on last year's effort which itself was more of an evolution than a revolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’re a supercross fan, it’s very easy to recommend Monster Energy Supercross 5. As ever, if you own one of its recent predecessors, it doesn’t really offer much that’s genuinely new.

The additions make the game more accessible than ever and is more fleshed out thanks to the new content. The main drawback is the lack of haptic feedback in relation to the track surface.,,,"There is no doubt that Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 5 is one of the best current titles in its segment, and even with some points for improvement, it offers an incredibly deep system of control and simulation of the sport. Correct in both content and visual style, it proves to be receptive to dedicated fans, but uninviting to new adepts.",,,,,,,,,"Despite having a clunky interface, the game itself is wonderfully well crafted. The dirt and terrain feel very real and learning to control yourself is both challenging and rewarding without ever getting frustrating. The DualSense controls are an absolute benefit to playing the game on the PlayStation 5 by allowing haptic feedback to the bike itself in a very well crafted and realistic way. Character customization suffers pretty hard but beyond that and the interface, the experience itself is really well done.",,,,,,,,"The game is more of the same if you know the franchise and that in itself is good and bad news. Good news in the sense that you know what to expect in terms of gameplay, because that's just fine. Bad news in the sense that it hardly brings anything new. There is plenty to do and experience, but we know it all from previous parts. In addition, the graphics are in some parts a bit outdated, however in general it looks fine. On the other hand, there is fine gameplay and a fun career mode, but it is time to take innovative steps.",,,"Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame takes advantage of the haptic feedback on the PS5 Dualsense controller. Thanks to this, players will feel the tension of racing on a sports bike. It might not look like a next-gen game, but fans will embrace the game thanks to its gameplay mechanics.",,,,"Compared to the first titles released since 2018, MES is more accessible, free, fast and clear in the composition of its game modes in addition to deepening its formula in the Solo career or the circuit editor. On the other hand, Milestone failed to make a leap forward from a graphical point of view, on the behavior of the AI, animations and collisions. Monster Energy Supercross isn't taking full advantage of the latest console generation just yet, and it's still going to take a while to feel a real sense of progression in the series.",,,,"Monster Energy Supercross 5 is easily Milestone's finest installment in the franchise, after a few years of diminishing returns. What Supercross 5 is missing in its surface-level game modes, it makes up for with thrilling racing at its core. Patience and a level head are needed to persevere upward through its demanding skill ceiling but it's wholeheartedly worth the pursuit. It's hard to tell whether future installments will offer enough innovation to keep the franchise riding on, but for now, we'll be tearing it up for fortune and glory.",,,,,,,A very competent motocross simulator with plenty of options and game modes. One of the best in its category.,,,,,,,"Based on the current model of Monster Energy Supercross 5 that dates back to its inception, this may be the most complete version of the game despite its legacy issues. It still seems like the series is stuck in the past, but finally making it accessible with the Futures Academy and showing proper training with exercises should help the game garner new fans. When the racing works, it can be fun. The experience is still marred with other AI issues outside of the pacing and the collision detection still remains awful. This version still feels like a more competent racer than the others and while it retains its Career Mode, Compound and Track Editor with small new editions, nothing in the latest version makes it a must have as compared to previous versions. This also includes the outdated roster that I wish Milestone could figure out a way to add in a roster update as post-launch DLC. Players that do buy this title annually should find the improvements suitable and if you’ve wanted a Supercross game for the first time and had to choose one, Monster Energy Supercross 5 is be the best choice.",,,,,,,"The most approachable this series has ever been, Monster Energy Supercross 5 is much kinder to newcomers while offering plenty of new content to please returning players. There’s still room for improvement but this game is the best Monster Energy Supercross title so far.",,,,"There was great curiosity for this fifth chapter dedicated to the world of American Supercross. Milestone confirmed the good he had already shown with the MXGP series, even if the overall result is not exceptional. We are facing a discreet title with some strengths and weaknesses: the graphics sector is still not up to par with the new consoles, while the AI would need the algorithms developed by Milestone itself for the MotoGP series. However, it is a fun title to play, with a highly customizable and surprisingly challenging driving model. The content offer regarding the game modes is good, while the possibility of downloading the contents produced by the community is confirmed as a nice plus.",,,,,,,,"Monster Energy Supercross 5 is a truly emotional experience, of pain, suffering, learning, and then more pain and suffering. The unforgivable mechanics, along with an erratic AI and an irregular physics system will make our helmet quickly acquainted with the dirt. However, the advancements in Career Mode and the inclusion of the new Track Editor make this the most competent entry in the franchise's history.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Monster Energy Supercross 5 takes all the main gameplay elements of the past edition, without making huge changes. For this reason, despite the work done by the Milestone team being overall quite good, those who expected a clear step forward compared to the earlier entries could be partially disappointed. Among the positive aspects, some tweaks to the physics and greater accessibility should be noted. Among the negative ones, the lack of significant new features stands out: more content would undoubtedly have improved a gaming experience which, however, remains more than enjoyable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-quarry,,,,,"The Quarry sits comfortably near the top of the interactive movie genre. Equal parts clever and terrifying, it earns its ten-hour runtime with a series of twists and turns that are sure to delight. There’s action, romance, comedy, and unbelievably disgusting violence. Supermassive Games have delivered a rollercoaster that serves as a fabulous follow-up to Until Dawn, so anyone who enjoys the genre will be in for one hell of a ride.",,,,"This game, or interactive movie if you prefer, is a great experience for horror fans. The story, gameplay (minimalistic as it is) and the acting are some of the best I've seen in this genre yet. While there are some things that do break the immersion, it's still an experience for lovers of visual novels and horror fans alike.","The Quarry does a fine job as a spiritual successor to the renowned Until Dawn, yet takes a few steps forward when it comes to character development and atmosphere building. Unfortunately, it sacrifices a few elements in the process which makes it a not so scary interactive movie more than a video game. Still, for lovers of the genre and Supermassive Games legacy – it’s a treat you should not miss.","But its baggy middle does become more taut in The Quarry’s strong denouement; the threat and deathcount rises, the story threads come together and your decisions show their consequence. The paths you choose make for quite the spiderweb, which Supermassive lets you poke into should you wish, and it is never less than impressive to see all of those different decisions pulling together your own personal story through the game. Even if there can be some odd cuts between scenes, a skipped beat because you managed to get one of the group killed.",,"The Quarry is a pulse-pounding teen slasher packed with strong characterisation, amazing atmosphere, and scrumptious visuals. Yes, it's not exactly the most challenging game thanks to dumbed down QTE events and interactions, but with a great story and heaps of replay value, you won't really care. If you're a fan of Until Dawn, then this is a must-have.",,,,,,,,,"The Quarry is a fantastic time but personally it’s a tough sell at $70 retail. I don’t see many replaying more than a couple times, and that’s really if you have connected enough with the story to go through again. The game could use some quality-of-life improvements like a scene skip once you complete the game, and overall this is a game for fans of this genre and those looking to have a unique experience that isn’t gameplay driven.",,"The Quarry is a thrilling experience from start to finish that any fan of Supermassive’s other horror games will immediately adore. If this is your first foray into their games, The Quarry is an excellent jumping-in point before diving into their other games. Standout performances, fantastic writing, and horrifying visuals are sure to delight all fans of horror.",,,,,,,,,Summer camp was never this thrilling when I was a kid.,,,,"The Quarry is a fun romp that, thanks to great casting and an intriguing mystery, manages to stay mostly engaging for its 9 hour story. The plot doesn't quite stick the landing, and some real challenge in the gameplay sequences would be nice, but nonetheless this is one of the better games from Supermassive in a long time.",,,,"As a fan of Supermassive's other games I was really excited for this one, hoping it would be as good as Until Dawn, but after I finished it I just felt disappointed, especially with the abrupt ending and bad writing that made me not even want to try another playthrough to see how else the story could have played out.",,,,,,,,,"The Quarry is a game that has its glitches and some technical issues, but that does not take away from the shine of playing a title with excellent actors who lent not only their faces, but also their acting talent, making this one of the best interactive story games from Supermassive Games.",,,,,,,,,"Coming straight out of left field, The Quarry surprises gamers with a fun and scary story, great (albeit sometimes buggy) graphics and gameplay that shows the devs actually listen to the players. Say hello to your game of the summer.","Despite its minor flaws, The Quarry finally is the fun teen survival horror we've been longing for since Until Dawn.","The Quarry is a lot of fun and certainly scratches the itch of wanting to control the dimwitted characters in a teen slasher movie with the hopes of prolonging their survival or killing them all, if you prefer. At just over 10 hours, it's a good length but with so many branching paths and possible endings, I wish that replayability was executed in a more streamlined manner.","The Quarry feels and plays a lot like Until Dawn, but it's not as scary as its ""older (and more famous) brother"".

But it's still a pretty fun game, that will probably make you want to play the whole story a couple of times to see the different scenes and endings.",,"If you like 80’s horror movies there are high chances that you will enjoy The Quarry. But, if you have played Until Dawn and you start this game with the same expectations chances are you will be disappointed. It rises up to the promise of a summer flick, but it is far from the best production of Supermassive Games. The replay value is affected by the structure of the game, The Quarry coming across as a needy teen that fails to captivate you after you given them the attention they seek. It can be a breezy and light experience for a hot summer weekend.",,,"The story is, as we have come to expect from Supermassive Games, very engrossing, shaped by the excellent characters and good cast.

Supermassive Games has been trying to better Until Dawn for seven years now, and at this point, it looks like it's never, ever going to happen. The Quarry is just a bit dull, and that's the exact opposite of what these types of titles strive to be.","With The Quarry, Supermassive Games gives the player a good horror experience that captures your imagination and keeps you glued to the controller. Not to mention that it invites you to play again and again to save all its protagonists to get the ultimate achievement.",,,,,"What we have here is a developer that is happy to nudge us with knowing jokes, but who doesn’t dare to frighten us. We might call it a Craven effort. As for the ending, there isn’t one—just a montage of postscripts, detailing the fates of the various characters. Only, we already know their fates, having been at least partially responsible for them. As the credits rolled, the sweetness of the humour had grown stale, and I felt distinctly unsated, though hardly hungry for more. I hate to say it, but Supermassive has made a Butterpop.",,,,,,"The Quarry features arguably the best writing and cast that Supermassive Games have ever put together, along with some impressive quality visuals in certain spots. However, the gameplay formula lacks improvements and is starting to grow stale.

The beginning can be slow but it hooks you in a special way. It is a gem for lovers of this genre.,"The Quarry's narrative easily surpasses previous The Dark Pictures Anthology entries with an engaging cast of characters and interesting mystery. Unfortunately, The Quarry plays better as a film rather than a video game as there aren't a whole lot of opportunities for players to explore or interact with the world.

All the content is filled with dialogue worthy of an anime arc, the unreleased characters get respect, and the memories are extremely touching for those who have followed the gang's travels. However, Bandai's title falls short in offering a rich experience for those who are not already familiar with Oda's work.",,,,,,"One Piece Odyssey is a refreshing change on a formula we learned to know up to this day from Shonen based anime games. It could have been better, but even with its flaws it a more than solid JRPG.","One Piece Odyssey surprisingly captures the charm of the show. The world is great, and the action looks superb. Even though the story is shallow and predictable, with too much backtracking, and the battles are far too easy, this is one of the best One Piece video games ever made. If you like the show, don’t miss out on grabbing this treasure.",,,"It's not every day you get to play a video game based on an anime or manga designed to utilize every aspect of the source material to make a great game, rather than simply cashing in on its popularity of it for a quick buck. One Piece: Odyssey tells a good story that spawns many of the franchise's various arcs allowing you to experience the vast One Piece lore in a brand new way. Its turn-based combat is simple but addicting and fun, utilizing each and every member of the Straw Hat crew to the best of their abilities.","One Piece Odyssey’s attention to detail and respect for its source material informs an original story that is, at times, obfuscated by drab side content, and an innovative combat system that, sadly, rarely gets pushed to its limits.","One Piece Odyssey is an excellent introduction to an Anime's world into RPGs. The gameplay is fun, with great content and a new adventure with the Straw Hat Pirates.",,,,,,"So, One Piece Odyssey is a game that as an RPG can be tackled without any problem, but I really don't recommend it if you're not interested in the saga, even if you want this to be your gateway. On the other hand, if you're a fan from hell and it doesn't bother you that the genre is turn-based, the invitation to Waford Island is within reach.",,"One Piece Odyssey is a rousing adventure thanks to its engaging combat, liberating character customization, and beautiful environments. Sometimes, design choices limit player agency, but the effect rarely lasts long. The end result is a mostly satisfying JRPG that should keep fans hooked, provided they make it through the forgettable first few hours and take advantage of the various systems. After a few initial rough patches, the game lives up to most of its potential and is easy to recommend as both a One Piece experience and a JRPG.","One Piece Odyssey is a great RPG when the story isn’t getting in the way of its pacing. There is so much to enjoy about the gameplay with its action and creativity, as well as the turn-based structure that is typical of this genre. On its own, the story isn’t too bad either. It is fun and light-hearted with a small sense of good drama to keep it engaging. But the unbalanced space sharing between both gameplay and story causes such a stop-and-go pacing problem that in the end the gameplay experience is so heavily disrupted that it is tough to enjoy the game.",,,"I did have a delightful time with One Piece Odyssey. The best way to summarise it is as a breezy, easy-playing JRPG that you can knock off over several weeks and a few solid sessions. The developers have crafted something blissfully over-the-top and funny, and done One Piece a grand homage to celebrate its 25th year, while at the same time very cleverly figuring out how to make a 25-year-old anime as entertaining for newcomers and those not familiar with Luffy and the crew as it is for those who have watched every single episode. That is some incredible work.","Despite these pitfalls, One Piece Odyssey is a success in storytelling, animation, and combat style. With a satisfying conclusion, One Piece Odyssey opens up a new world of potential storytelling in the One Piece universe. It's also proof that, if done correctly, games adapting iconic or expansive manga can be strong - if not groundbreaking - entries in the JRPG genre.",,,"One Piece Odyssey is a love letter that really knows how to hit the spot for fans. It still has room for improvement and a ton of potential, but ILCA has done well creating a well designed battle system. The OST is simply amazing, and the story is good enough to make sure to keep you entertained for a ton of hours.",,,,,"If the trailers successfully convinced you that One Piece Odyssey is of a scale of something like Dragon Quest, then you've been fooled.

Its clever approach to storytelling feels like a ‘greatest hits’ of sorts, and revisiting familiar places and faces is sure to be a joy for any fan. That said, this colourful, lively world is such a pleasure to be part of that even if you’re not well acquainted with Luffy and co, you’ll soon warm to their charm. An excellent blend of combat, adventure and storytelling, this is a JRPG not to be missed.",,"The main thing is, One Piece Odyssey has made me want to watch the anime. Yes, I’m aware it’s over 1000-episodes-long and is only just getting to its final arc now, but the world of Eiichiro Oda’s franchise seems more inviting now than ever, and that’s all down to what this game has shown me.","One Piece Odyssey might appeal to long time fans of Luffy and co, but the glacial pace really drags it down.","This is a distinctive, appealing example of the JRPG genre that also nails the essence of the One Piece universe. Fans from both worlds will adore it, and I found it to be a perfect appetiser as I await The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom later this year.","One piece Odyssey celebrates 25 years of the anime by providing a game with gameplay that is at times just as old. The turnbased fights have some interesting new elements, but outside the fights a lot feels oldfashioned. Quests lack a sense of progress, no fast travel during quests and the use of savepoints make this game feel like it hasn't progressed beyond a few decades ago. Fortunately, the anime itself is brilliant and makes you eager to go watch it right after you close the game.","If you've watched the thousands of episodes of the anime, One Piece Odyssey is -probably- the game of your dreams. But if you don't know what a Devil Fruit is and you're searching for a good RPG to sink your teeth in, you should keep searching.","One Piece Odyssey is first and foremost made for longtime followers of the manga and anime. That said, there is enough backstory and information to keep the casual gamer engaged. One Piece Odyssey is a robust, well-made JRPG that’s faithful to the core audience but fun for almost any turn-based action fan. Aside from the somewhat annoying, patchwork pacing and occasionally repetitive backtracking, One Piece Odyssey’s combat and oddball characters are fun to spend time with.",,,"One Piece Odyssey offers some of the franchise's most iconic moments, without appealing to mindless nostalgia and moving the plot forward. With solid and traditional combat and exploration systems, it lacks in the narrative unnecessarily and in the limited level design, but the balance is still very positive, especially if you are a fan of the Straw Hat Pirates.",,,,"One Piece Odyssey took on the tough task of being accessible to those who don’t know the source material, while also catering to the fans of the franchise. At its heart, One Piece Odyssey is a love letter to the fans, but that doesn’t stop from being a fantastic gateway into the world.","One Piece Odyssey is a nice RPG for fans of the franchise. It's clearly crafted with a lot of love, and there's a ton of great banter and interaction between the cast members. The core gameplay is perfectly serviceable, but it never really reaches the realm of ""great,"" and it takes a bit too long to get going. It's probably not going to attract the attention of anyone who isn't a big ""One Piece"" fan, but for those fans, it should be an enjoyable little RPG. At the end of the day, how much fun you'll have boils down to how much you enjoy punching bad pirates in the face with your favorite pirates, and there's a whole lot of folks who want just that.",,,,,"One Piece Odyssey scores with a lot of wit and heart, but is sometimes as tough as rubber.",,"One Piece Odyssey is the game that the fans have been asking for a long time.

There are some minor technical issues, but none of these will spoil the gaming experience with the result that One Piece Odyssey is one of the better games ever in the franchise.",,"No matter whether you're a hardcore One Piece fan or a complete newcomer, One Piece Odyssey is an utter joy of a JRPG. Its combat system remains incredibly enjoyable throughout, and new mechanics provide depth and strategy in droves. Most certainly the highlight of the experience, but with fun exploration to boot, you're always assured of a good time. One Piece Odyssey plays a lot like Dragon Quest XI, and it's not that far off being just as good as it.",,,,,"Redundant and not very rhythmic, it risks leaving some players on the floor. But still, thanks to its engaging universe and its ingenious combat system, the game holds up well.",,,,,,"Just right for fans of turn-based role-playing games and the dye Straw Hat Pirates. The great animated attacks spread anime flair, but probably only ignite their full potential with fans.",,,,"Odd but alluring in the same way as its source material, Odyssey puts its best foot forward then stumbles. A fun, if slow, RPG take on the anime. [Issue#24, p.78]","One Piece is back with a new adventure game created by ILCA and Bandai Namco, a classic JRPG with fun turn-based battles, good graphics and an interesting plot… but its gameplay is quite basic and straightforward.",,,,,,"It’s clear, both in Odyssey’s thrilling combat and colorful art direction, that ILCA harbors a lot of love for its source material. But these fleeting moments of joy make their counterparts — hapless storytelling, terrible pacing, and stilted navigation — all the more exhausting by comparison. The kernel of a good RPG exists within Odyssey’s framework, but it’s surrounded by so much muck that it can’t shine through. One Piece has a long, storied history, but I suspect Odyssey will soon be forgotten.","One Piece Odyssey delivers a great One Piece adventure, but without regard to the source material, is simply a good but unremarkable RPG. Hardcore One Piece fans will eat this up like a smorgasbord of Sanji’s cooking, but even with the Memoria sections, it’s a lot for newcomers to take in. The overly-simplistic gameplay and excessive handholding would likely be off putting for RPG fans who are in search of a good game but don’t care about the source material. Those who are not already familiar with the exploits of the Straw Hat Pirates are probably better off sailing past Waford, but this is the ideal game for established One Piece fans.",,"This is a very simple, very lineal JRPG with an interesting combat system that doesn’t really shine. Enjoyable, but not enough to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the franchise.","While One Piece Odyssey is an entirely original story that retreads some not-so-original grounds, the sum of its parts equals up to a good game and a great time all around. Does it do enough to carve out a spot in the hearts of JRPG lovers around the world? Not entirely, but those that love One Piece will find a competent and beautiful RPG that is crafted with care.","One Piece Odyssey is the ultimate adventure for a diehard One Piece fan. It's touching to be able to revisit the people and places making up some of the series most iconic story arcs in a way that feels rich and immersive rather than skimmed-through and streamlined. Some quirks in the overworld exploration and a few combat design flaws might make this a but of an unpolished RPG on paper, but if you've spent the last two decades with Luffy and his crew, then the shine and charm of One Piece Odyssey is undeniable.","One Piece Odyssey is ultimately a story of friendship, a central theme of the series shown through the eyes of a new character to pass judgment and to understand why the bonds of this crew are so strong. While this adventure might retell past quests, there are enough subtle changes to spark some real emotion. Still, the low difficulty and reliance on auto-battle will leave hardcore JRPG fans disinteresting. However, the exploration and numerous ways to dump dozens of hours into this experience make this a One Piece adventure for everyone.","If you are a fan of both One Piece and classic JRPGs, then One Piece: Odyssey is not bad. It has restored the original plot well and has built vivid characters. However, the experience of playing it may not be a pleasure due to some outdated design.",,,,"While it won't be remembered among the greatest JRPGs of all time, it will surely be among the best One Piece Games ever made, and while it's definitely not a high mountain to conquer, ILCA definitely did it with style, creating a solid game that will be liked by One Piece fans and JRPG aficionados alike.","The route traced by the guys from ILCA is undoubtedly the right one, which is why we hope that the studio will continue to work on the license in the years to come and that it can therefore perfect the shot with a hypothetical sequel.","Despite some flaws, like an improvable storytelling, One Piece Odyssey surely is the best One Piece game to date, even if the bar set by previous entries was pretty low to begin with.","One Piece Odyssey is the best video game story set in the One Piece universe to date. A delightful story and beautiful worlds more than make up for some more frustrating and outdated JRPG staples. Non-fans of the franchise might have a harder time getting into the already-established world, but it’s a hurdle that can absolutely be cleared. Whether players are newcomers or lifelong fans, One Piece Odyssey is a grand adventure absolutely worth going on.",,,,,,"One Piece Odyssey has some pacing issues, and doesn't do anything tremendously innovative in the JRPG genre, but it will be indispensable for any fan of One Piece and gaming in general. It allows players to visit four previous arcs of the anime, relive iconic battles, and even reunite with some long-lost characters, all while keeping each character's personality traits very much alive. There are several hours of exploration and nostalgia waiting for Luffy and company.",,,"One Piece Odyssey proves that a classic turn-based RPG is a good genre fit for the world and characters of One Piece, and that makes it rewarding despite a lack of tension in its all-too-easy fights and some frustrating quest design that pads out its length.","One Piece Odyssey is an extraordinary JRPG from one of the most popular anime around. Characters are overflowing with charisma, and you will get to know them much better which is a great start if you plan to embark on a 1000+ episodes adventure. This game will help you get a grip on the One Piece universe so even rookies will be sucked into this fun adventure and not feel left out. So put on your straw hat and get busy finding One Piece.","The new big One Piece adventure, while charming in parts, is unfortunately stuck too deep in a hole of backtracking, unpolished ideas, and frustration to provide any joy outside its large fan base.","While there are a few issues that will frustrate, One Piece: Odyssey is a great romp with the Straw Hat crew featuring a brand new tale that incorporates some of their best story arcs so far.","If you always wanted to join the Straw Hat Pirates, then One Piece Odyssey is the adventure for you regardless of your proficiency with video games. However, it wouldn’t necessarily be the best game for everyone else. Those who love Tales titles or are experienced with turn-based RPGs would do better with a different, more challenging title that doesn’t expect you to be familiar with the source material. It is a very easy adventure that expects a certain degree of knowledge about One Piece, even with Lim using the memory cubes to offer brief asides during chapters. But if you are a fan and are up for an effortless, nostalgic, and pretty stroll, this will leave you satisfied.",,"Fans of One Piece and turn-based RPG lovers alike will be more than pleased with what One Piece Odyssey has to offer. Its combat offers a great new spin on the genre’s trademark battle systems, and is far deeper than one would expect from an anime-inspired title. Even if it isn’t perfect, the game takes chances in the best way possible and could very well lay the groundwork for much more promising One Piece games in the future.",,"Fans are in good hands with One Piece: Odyssey. In fact, more anime games should be following in strides made here. On offer is a wonderful adventure that feels like a theme park visit to the series lands, old and new. Characters shine and bounce off each other well both in and out of cutscenes as colourfully as they should. Some areas need better story pacing and quality of life improvements such as better checkpointing and save states, and going more all-in on different story timelines would’ve also gone a long way. And it’s testing to see manga artist Eiichiro Oda’s troublesome female character design. However, it’s a blast of an RPG. Flaws are more than made up for in a thoroughly enjoyable anime affair along with an unexpected and very welcome spin on the known turn-based RPG formula. Smooth sailing lies ahead with One Piece: Odyssey.",,"Solid Japanese role-playing game with decent technology, a good combat system but weaknesses in terms of demand, tension and storytelling.",,"One Piece Odyssey passes the test by making the leap into the turn-based RPG genre. Fans of the series will be delighted with this story with a new story arc. It has interesting mechanics but can feel very easy at first. It gets more interesting as we go along, and it's great to see the characters perform their signature moves.",,,,"After a very nice first chapter, One Piece Odyssey gets bogged down in a tiring structure that multiplies the back and forth to excess, with numerous narrative cuts that chop up the rhythm of the adventure. The completely out-of-touch combat balancing finished convincing us that Bandai Namco's JRPG didn't have much interesting to offer, except for a few convincingly staged cutscenes. Nevertheless, it is a game that is just neat and addictive enough for hardcore fans of the cult manga to enjoy.","I have reservations about the experience as a whole – however, I can't help but smile thinking about this adventure with the Straw Hats. It nails the core cast of characters, the Memoria areas are fun to revisit, and the revelations surrounding Waford, Lim, and Adio ultimately satisfy. Of course, I can't thoroughly recommend this voyage for someone new to One Piece, but seasoned pirates will find a worthy adventure on the horizon.",,,"One Piece Odyssey is a slog to play, with horrendous pacing and progression issues destroying what little good can be found in the story and combat.","One Piece Odyssey is definitely the best game dedicated to Eiichiro Oda's omnibus work, and a perfect JRPG for newcomers. Those who don't like One Piece or are looking for a more challenging and in-depth experience would do well to look elsewhere, knowing however that such successful adaptations are a very rare commodity indeed.",,,,,,,,"One Piece Odyssey is a real success on several points, providing a real pleasure to live again reworked key moments from One Piece, with an addictive turn based JRPG.","One Piece Odyssey shows that the grand scale of the franchise is a good fit for a solid traditional RPG. The combat system is fun, and it’s great to get reacquainted with beloved characters and locations. If you're new to the series or just have some curiosity about it, the gameplay likely isn't strong enough on its own to keep you going. However, for fans that are already heavily invested in the Straw Hat Crew’s adventures, it's a tale worth checking out.",,"One Piece Odyssey is a wonderful trip down memory lane for fans of the series. The game’s original story is earnest and the endearing bond between the Straw Hat Pirates comes through loud and clear. The engaging combat system and a decent number of side quests don’t hurt either. Sure, new players might get overwhelmed by some of the rushed chapters in the midgame and the flow between chapters could be better, but it’s hard not to notice the amount of heart and soul that was poured into the game. More than just a fantastic anime-based video game, One Piece Odyssey is an impressive JRPG and already one of the best surprises this year.","A stunning One Piece game great for fans and JRPG newbies, but one that won't satisfy hardened min-maxers.","Fundamentally, One Piece Odyssey isn't a bad RPG, just a very generic one that strives to do little more than tick off all the checkboxes of what players expect from the genre: side quests, crafting, cooking, fan-service, and so on. Attaching the One Piece license to it results in expectations that are only partially met: While the Straw Hats are as delightful as ever to be around, the story they've found themselves stuck in is not. Ultimately, the greatest sin of One Piece Odyssey is wasted potential, something it shares with many of the other video game adaptations of the franchise.",,"One Piece Odyssey does have its flaws in how its role-playing experience eventually works out over the course of its many hours, but when stacked against everything that's come before, it really is the best One Piece game yet. It's got a lot of fun things for fans of the series to dig into, and there is a lot of care and attention to detail paid in bringing the Straw Hat crew's various personalities and attacks to life. It might not be the best experience for the more dedicated, but it's definitely a perfect fit for current fans.",,,"ONE PIECE ODYSSEY is a fantastic journey with the Straw Hat Crew, that combines a light-hearted adventure, with a fun and flashy combat system. A must-play if you’re a ONE PIECE fan, though still very much recommended even if you’re not.",,"One Piece Odyssey isn’t the most perfect adventure, but it is a grand one that plays to its strengths. It sets out to be a journey that anyone can enjoy, and achieves it by embracing well-established formulas while adding its own flavor into the mix. While there are a few bad winds pushing the ship away from the harbor of being a perfect experience, this is an excellent addition to the JRPG genre and one that I think you should try out whether you’re a big One Piece fan or just an appreciator of JRPGs.",,,,,,,"A tale built on revisiting past adventures in media res, One Piece Odyssey relies so much on retelling great stories that came before it that the adventure in Waford alongside Lim and Adio feels like an afterthought.",,,,"There is an audience for One Piece Odyssey. Sometimes, in the middle of an exciting battle or while revisiting some of my favorite locations from the original series, I think I could be part of that audience. I’ve been a fan of the property for over 20 years and still read the manga every week. I’m not the world’s biggest One Piece fan, but I’m certainly an enduring one. But the repetition made the game a struggle to complete. As amazing as the game feels to start, it trudges across the finish line. A more patient player, or one whose love for One Piece is far more enthusiastic than mine, might be able to see past the repetition for the loving nostalgia underneath. For non-fans, or those of us looking for something meatier, One Piece Odyssey is more filler than killer.",,,"Through the animations alone I can see there was a lot of care put into creating this game, with some serious attention to detail (even down to Sanji refusing to damage the sole female enemy in the game). But there are some very basic design decisions, especially regarding game progression that hamper the experience greatly. The backtracking continues throughout even all the way to the very end, to the point that I really wondered what the extra padding was for. I’m not even interested in the post-game quest of fighting tougher opponents since all the boss fights prior were so basic. The great cast just isn’t enough to not make certain parts of the game feel like a chore. For the One Piece fan who can handle a bit of tedium and lackluster bosses, I can recommend it, for anyone else I wouldn’t suggest it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A celebration of the franchise, One Piece Odyssey is a well-made JRPG with an interesting cast and pretty and colorful worlds, ripe for cozy exploration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intentionally or not, it captures something of the ennui of young adulthood and 90s Gen X disillusionment with menial work – and how video games have always been a colourful escape from the boredom of everyday life.",,"Arcade Paradise is neither a great managing game, nor a a great minigame compilation, but the combination of both gameplay styles work well. We enjoyed its setting in the eighties, and the feeling of growing our own arcade empire. Some elements get repetitive after two or three days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’re nostalgic for the 90s and genuinely enjoy minigame compilations, Arcade Paradise is utterly essential. The title’s tongue-in-cheek tycoon gameplay and simulator window dressing serve as the backdrop for dozens upon dozens of video game parodies, spanning a GTA-style Pac-Man clone through to an OutRun-inspired futuristic racer. Not every idea shines, but the sheer density of content alone means you’ll never get bored. And with an addictive progression system that’s forever tempting you with something shiny on the horizon, this release actually lives up to its name: it’s truly an arcade paradise.",,,,A clever management sim that pays homage to both the arcades of the 1990s and the exquisite drudgery of teenage jobs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arcade Paradise is a superb management sim that puts you in the shoes of both the arcade manager and the player. Whether you are an old arcade head like me or somebody who can only view things through a historic lens, there is so much to enjoy here. Once you get past the necessary grind of the opening hours the game opens up to become an almost encyclopaedic slice of arcade life. Even when you’ve upgraded the arcade, there are always high scores to chase too.",,,"Arcade Paradise is a cracking laundry / arcade simulator that rewards you for your patience and dedication to the cause. Once the arcade opens up you’ll have an absolute blast finding your new favourite game in a huge selection of unique takes on old school classics. There’s a road to get there, but this one is all about the destination. A hugely rewarding, feel-good experience you have to play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The management simulation of a laundromat that is slowly turning into an arcade center is a great homage to some earlier times that, like a dream, mix and match two different decades and several generations of arcades and even consoles into one trippy mix.",,,,,,"With bugs, crashes and far too much waiting around, Arcade Paradise really tries to capture some of the highs of old arcades but never really manages to understand the joy that comes from it.",,,,,In a nutshell this game is for 90's nostalgics or players who really enjoy minigame compilations. Arcade Paradise is absolutely essential. It's the most original game I've played this year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mortal-shell-enhanced-edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Representing the definitive version of Mortal Shell that should provide a compelling offering for newcomers and veterans alike, Mortal Shell: Enhanced Edition is a highly polished Soulslike. Though not up to the standard of its classic inspirations, Mortal Shell: Enhanced Edition nonetheless stands ably on its own merit thanks to some great combat and a series of under the hood innovations that the genre at large might consider adopting.",,,,,,,,,,,"In sum, if you’re like me and like the Souls games for their lore and gameplay, but don’t want to spend hours in frustration with asinine difficulty, give Mortal Shell a sincere chance. Like any game in this genre, it can take several hours to get really comfortable with and in the groove, but when you do, it will hold on tight and you won’t want to put it down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For those who already own Mortal Shell on either Xbox One or PS4, this enhanced edition arrives as a free update or upgrade path, and it’s a very good reason to return to it. For those who haven’t yet journeyed into its grim world, however, there’s never been a better time, especially on PS5. This isn’t simply Mortal Shell with the resolution and framerate uncapped; the visuals have been dramatically improved while still ensuring a consistent 60fps experience, and DualSense support has been implemented with care. With Mortal Shell: Enhanced Edition, developer Cold Symmetry has really given its game a chance to shine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, Mortal Shell: Enhanced Edition succeeds on several levels. It's an excellent update to a surprise indie hit that is still mighty enjoyable for anyone interested in the Soulslike genre. While difficulty and pacing get in the way, Mortal Shell is a short, sweet, and most importantly, challenging game to tide you over to the next main Souls offering.",,,,,,,,,,"Mortal Shell is a quite good A-RPG with original - but imperfect - mechanics and a poor RPG section. With this new release, the game gains 60FPS, 4K and better textures. Not the better ""Souls game"", but a pretty descent alternative.",,,,"Mortal Shell: Enhanced Edition is undeniably inspired by the likes of Dark Souls, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. While the upgrade doesn’t fix every technical problem the original had, the PS5 enhancements are enough to make this version the definitive version of the game. If Demon's Souls didn’t scratch your Souls-like itch, Mortal Shell: Enhanced Edition is worth a try.",,,,,"If it is not free from flaws or free of any bugs or annoying moments, Mortal Shell remains a quite solid choice for fans of the genre, who will have to accept, a small development team obliges, to have a game less dense and deep than those of From Software, but strong enough to be played without displeasure.",,,,,,"While Mortal Shell cannot completely fill the big shoes of ""Dark Souls"", it is an impressive debut by Cold Symmetry. We especially liked the unique art design and the motivating battle system and are looking forward to a successor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mortal Shell is a bold reinterpretation of what a Soulslike can be and a wonderful debut from Cold Symmetry. It contains lip-biting combat and interesting characters that bring the world to life. While enemy and environmental diversity is lacking, there are still many great bosses and challenges for players to face and conquer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mortal Shell makes for a strong introduction to Souls-likes, a demonstration for new players of what so many have found so interesting about From Software's games and those like them. But Mortal Shell is also a lovingly crafted, weird, and deceptively deep game in its own right that rewards you for wandering its twisted paths and challenging its deadliest foes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Thanks to an increased, stabilised framerate, and clever use of the DualSense, PS5 offers the definitive version of Mortal Shell. Just remember it’s no Demon’s Souls. [Issue#187, p.84]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mortal Shell Enhanced Edition might be a little light on next-gen upgrades, but the ones that matter are there and they are game-changing. 60FPS is the main attraction but a nice 4K is welcome, too. For returning fans, it’s a nice free update. For newcomers looking to get punished, it’s a cheap and, well, not cheerful game, but it is its own brand of fun – if you can call it that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wrc-generations,,,,,,,,"Whilst the presentation is stale, the driving of WRC Generations remains as engaging as ever. The new hybrid engines gave me something else to consider whilst adhering to the pace notes but the handling remained steady and reliable.

I do wish they pushed the boat out for their final outing with the license but what's here is a solid product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WRC Generations is a good rally game. A great one, even. But a lack of innovation and genuinely new content makes it the least essential entry in the series for some time.

But those with only a casual interest in the sport might want to stick with WRC 10 until this last official WRC effort from KT Racing goes on sale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WRC Generations is unfortunately a game that leaves a lot to be desired, and in many ways, this will disappoint quite a lot of fans of the franchise out there. While it does come with intriguing improvements, such as the addition of hybrid cars, it fails to impress in the areas that you’d expect it to shine, such as the graphics. The DualSense integration feels nice, but this should no longer be something to praise a game for given it’s already 2022 and the PlayStation 5 has been around for a while. Should you buy WRC Generations? This depends on your expectations. If you’re a WRC fan like I am, you’ll probably end up having some fun with it, but otherwise, you’ll notice every little shortcoming from the moment you fire it up the first time.",,,"WRC Generations should be the ultimate final installment in the series, but only half succeeds. There is absolutely no shortage of content with plenty of cars and tracks, giving you hours of gameplay. At the same time, it is lacking in innovation and improvement, including relatively mediocre physics. If you already have the previous part, this is not worth it. If you are new, then thankfully WRC Generations has plenty to offer despite some shortcomings.",,,,,,,"If we would have liked for the last dance of the KT Racing-WRC collaboration real novelties on the Career mode and a little more fantasy on the classic game modes or the dressing, WRC Generations does the job. First in the modeling of his specials, then in handling his cars according to the surfaces and the conditions. In line with a successful anniversary episode, the ultimate title succeeds, without drastically upsetting its formula, in being a lasting opus and with the best lifespan of the saga. More than 150 stages in 22 countries, more than 80 racing cars with the addition of hybrid engines for the WRC, daily and weekly multi-league and club modes, the objective has been achieved by Kylotonn Racing: the title is immortal.",,,,,,,,,,"A competent and substantial rally experience, but not quite the stuff of legend. It’s the best of Kylotonn’s offerings, and a decent swansong for its WRC series. [Issue#22, p.91]",,,,,,,,,,,,"WRC Generations is a fitting conclusion to KT Racing's time with the WRC license. It's like a farewell tour, a greatest hits collection, and a new album all at once. There's a lot that regular players will have seen before, from returning rallies to the latest refinements of the accessible but challenging racing, but the new Rally1 cars add a little spice to the top tier rallying, and Leagues and the sheer wealth of stages to race on could ensure this game is still getting plenty of mileage a couple of years from now.",,,,WRC Generations shows how much the series has grown by combining the best elements from the past several games.,,,,,,,,,"In the seven years that KT Racing has been at the helm of development, we certainly haven't seen any radical changes or major improvements. Even so, in those years the series has had some of its most interesting moments, which are now offered all together in one package.",,,,,"When you get into the guts of it, WRC Generations is by no means a drastic shake-up on its quality predecessors, even if there have been some small but welcome improvements to the career mode and customisation tools that have spiked my enthusiasm. It does, however, deserve credit for both the very respectable range of relevant rally cars it features, as well as its absolute mountain of rally locations. With almost every country to host the WRC over the last decade represented, WRC Generations may be KT Racing’s last WRC game, but there’s nothing least about it. The kitchen sink philosophy has resulted in a fantastic and uncommonly generous package for gravel groupies, asphalt addicts, and mud-slinging maniacs alike.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It does do its own thing in many areas which is fine, but the dungeons are very simple and repetitive and the side content feels like padding although the rewards are worth it. It's not the next Atlus classic but it's a fun game nonetheless that may be a more forgiving entry point to the series.",,"Soul Hackers 2 is a surprising sequel. But another surprising thing is its accessibility and openness to the new players of the whole Shin Megami Tensei franchise. If this is to be your first one, it’s an excellent step to take.",,,Soul Hackers 2 feels like a budget title whose developers did the best with what they had. It's still a solid game with plenty to love that fans of the genre will certainly enjoy. A strong addition to the Shin Megami Tensei franchise with great combat and art direction only held back by uninspired dungeons and exploration.,,"Soul Hackers 2 mixes great elements of both Shin Megami Tensei and Persona to come out with a satisfying result overall. Story is well done and exciting, anime-style aesthetics are beautiful, and music by Monaca is engaging. This could be your next RPG sleeper hit.","Soul Hackers 2 is good news for fans of Persona and Shin Megami Tensei, a JRPG that, despite not reaching the excellence of its more direct predecessors, delivers a remarkable experience that knows how to find its own space within the demonic universe of Atlus .",,,,,"Soul Hackers 2 is a little and simple, but very good Shin Megami Tensei game. It is true that it's level design is pretty bland, but it's music, story, combat and characters, are pretty great.","It feels like a comfort food RPG for Shin Megami fans, one that you’ll likely enjoy while waiting for the next big thing, but not one that’s going to come close to dominating that #1 RPG spot on most lists for the year. It doesn’t take a lot of chances, and instead just tends to lean into the elements that people already enjoy from other Shin Megami games. As such, it’s not going to really bump the Devil Summoner subseries to new heights, and I suspect it’ll be a while before we see another entry in this particular series, but overall Soul Hackers 2 is a solid bit of fun, and easy to suggest to anyone that has any sort of affinity for these games.","Soul Hackers 2 is a great new entry to the SMT franchise, offering enough differences from its comrades that it doesn't feel like the exact same game. With its wonderful cast of characters, Soul Hackers 2 delivers a story that shows plenty of heart as well as heartbreak, with a theme that resonates with today’s world. Despite the bland dungeons, the combat is more than satisfying enough to make up for it, and the music is just a bonus to an already stylish game. If there’s an itch to play an SMT game, Soul Hackers 2 is sure to scratch it.",,,,"Soul Hackers 2 is a smart, evocative, and classically dark game from the Shin Megami Tensei tradition. It’s not going to turn heads like Persona 5 and SMT V did, but the developers seem to have realised this and taken the opportunity to deliver a harder-hitting and more thought-provoking narrative. To me, that’s Atlus getting back to its core vision for the broad and extended SMT property. That’s what I want from this series.","There's a lot to like about Soul Hackers 2, and just one major problem: how quickly it disposes of its world and the undercurrents of the narrative there to arrive at its end goal. The characters involved and the systems at play range from rock solid to great, however, and if Soul Hackers 2 is the first in a long line of games with the same world-building and aesthetic, I'd be willing to bet it's going to be looked back on as the start of something special. For now, Soul Hackers 2 is a good JRPG, one that's well worth your time - but it could be, and hopefully will result in, so much more.",,,,,,"I wandered into Soul Hackers 2 expecting a general sense of quality from Atlus, and ended up getting sucked into its world. While dungeon design can feel samey at times, it’s not enough to distract from the flashiness of the game as a whole. As usual, Atlus really nails the details; it was fun to hang out with this crew and see where things went.",,,,,,"Soul Hackers 2 is yet another stellar JRPG from Atlus. It may take many of its themes and gameplay elements from other JRPGs within the company’s umbrella, but it somehow still manages to feel unique thanks to its fresh setting and characters. Whether or not you’re familiar with its predecessor or the Shin Megami Tensei games in general, this is a must-have if you want to conquer dungeons while exploring an intriguing vision of our future.",,,"Soul Hackers 2 has great combat and a story worth checking out, but the repetitive environments and constant barrage of enemies make the experience less than stellar.",,,,,,,"Soul Hackers 2 is a different title than what is usually expected from Atlus, but it is also one of their best and most original games in recent years. It's a highly recommended title if you're already a fan of the company's games or turn-based RPGs in general.",,,,,"Soul Hackers 2 is a good — but not great — entry into the franchise. I had quite a lot of fun with it, and I think the cast is one of my favorites in the SMT games, but it has a ""low-budget"" feel that is difficult to escape, and the Soul Matrix concept feels lackluster.

Optimizing your party can be quite enjoyable but the inconsistent demon recruiting system takes away from the fun of the grind. Overall, Soul Hackers 2 failed to keep my attention but it definitely has some noteworthy qualities.",,,"If not for the interesting cast of characters and beautiful cyberpunk world, Soul Hackers 2 would truly be just a poor man’s Persona game.

With awful dungeon design and little else to do outside of them, it falls upon the engaging combat system and interesting enough narrative to pick up the pieces. It's by no means the next must-play JRPG, but there's just enough to Soul Hackers 2 that warrants a playthrough.",,,,A frustrating mix of the best and worst of Persona results in a disappointing Shin Megami Tensei spin-off that prioritises streamlined gameplay over innovation.,"Behind its colorful neon lights, Soul Hackers 2 remains an ""old-school"" role-playing game that strays from more recent titles in its franchise like Persona 5 Royal or Shin Megami Tensei V. Beyond its cyberpunk anime aesthetic, the Atlus' game relies on an ever-effective and proven SMT-like combat system, but also on its friendly cast of characters who stand out for their original designs. Unfortunately, the experience is served by a story that is ultimately quite simple, with some technical shortcomings, but above all by its far too basic and repetitive dungeons which struggle to stimulate the player. A title that has something to please experienced role-playing game enthusiasts.",,,,,"Soul Hackers 2 is a game that tries to make everyone happy, keeping a classic soul but rejuvenating the genre with gameplay elements from Persona 5.

[Recommended],,,,,,,"Soul Hackers 2 is a by the books turn-based JRPG that doesn’t do anything particularly memorable nor offensive. The story is lacking in scope, dungeons are bland, and there’s questionable design choices to tried and true systems. It doesn’t help that there’s less-than-stellar load times on the current generation consoles, especially considering the amount of traveling that’s required. With that said, there’s decent character development, a fantastic combat system and of course all your favorite demons and creatures you’d expect, and then some. On top of that, the visual aesthetic (at least outside of dungeons) is tremendously vibrant, bringing your screen to life in the most enticing way possible. In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game, but it comes with numerous flaws. Soul Hackers 2 has all the trappings of a great Shin Megami Tensei game, including heart, but lacks the substance to make it special.","Soul Hackers 2 is a step forward for the series, one that respects your time and commitment to the JRPG genre.

It isn’t afraid to agonize its cast to produce respective, varying levels of catharsis, ultimately crafting a courageous title at the apex of Atlus’ catalog.","Soul Hacker 2 is a traditional JRPG that you can easily spend hours on, but also mediocre in every aspect. Although the classic training system has enough depth, and the turn-based system also involved some minor changes, the interest of the combat system is still limited. A lot of looting content improves the playability of the game, however the looting experience is monotonous and boring.",,"While it does have its stumbles, Soul Hackers 2 is a stylish JRPG with an intriguing premise and a compelling cast, and a fantastic battle system that more than makes up for the flaws it does have.","An intriguing story, interesting battle system, and signature art style is usually a good combo, and Soul Hackers 2 is no exception. It is easy to get lost in the story or side-quests and enjoy battling a variety of demons. For anybody enjoying Atlus' other turn-based titles, this is definitely a must-have.",Soul Hackers 2 is a solid JRPG with much less character than it looks.,"ATLUS managed to surprise us again. Drawing on a hybrid system between Shin Megami Tensei and Persona, the studio has packaged an articulated and galvanizing role-playing experience, which has nothing to envy to the best JRPGs of recent years. If the Tregenda proved to be an excellent alternative to the now classic All-Out-Attack, embellishing and renewing an already articulated and profound combat system such as the ""Press Turn"" System, the Demonic Reconnaissance has instead been able to significantly streamline the exploratory component, as well as the collection of funds, materials and the recruitment of new Demons. On the flip side, the cross-gen nature and an inorganic artistic direction prevented the product from aiming for excellence, demonstrating once again how much ATLUS needs to improve in terms of graphics and performance. Ultimately Soul Hackers 2 may not be the new Persona 5, but that's just fine.","Even with its bland dungeon design and lack of new ideas, Soul Hackers 2 is still an enjoyable and recommendable turn based JRPG, not on par with Atlus' best works but still better than many similar products.

That’s not simply because the game is rather content light in every other area, either. Getting to experience Ringo discover the depths of humanity while navigating a strange new world was fun. Every character feels very well written with their own depth. The nicely strategic combat with having to judge risk and rewards and play with weaknesses truly made me never shy away from combat as I never got sick of fighting.",,"Soul Hackers 2 is one of Atlus’ best games to date. The story is compelling and rooted in familiar dark themes while avoiding the fluff to be a sharper experience. It refreshes the gameplay of Persona 5 with streamlined changes to make it approachable for a wider audience. Its parallels to Atlus’ most recent JRPGs mean it offers more of the same thrilling style along with the same minor faults. Still, Shin Megami Tensei fans will love this game.",,,,"Soul Hackers 2 does its best to distance itself from its sister series Persona but with more simplified mechanics.

Nonetheless, Soul Hackers 2 it's enjoyable experience, easy to recommend to all the fans of the Megami Tensei franchise, and a great starting point for a new series.","Full of good intentions, Soul Hackers 2 never really convinces: its limited gameplay and redundant environments make it an experience that shows its limits very quickly, and it should take you a couple of hours before you get to the bottom of it.

The character interactions and stylish art help it stand out from the pack, and the smooth-flowing, fast-paced combat makes even some of the more annoying dungeons (I don't want to see another abandoned subway for a very long time) feel like less of a drag.

I never especially disliked the game, but I often flipped between enjoyment and disappointment within mere minutes. That feeling of disappointment is what remains in the end. I am not sure if Soul Hackers 2 is exciting enough to hold new fans through to the end, and it isn’t mechanically competent enough to fully grab the attention of a series veteran like myself. But there is still the visual flair, musical swagger, plethora of rad demons, and bonds of friendship you forge along the way to make it an enticing package.","Soul Hackers 2 is a great spin-off. It isn’t as long or ambitious as other Shin Megami Tensei titles, but it’s clearly made with the same quality.

This is one of the few games in Gundam that heavily encourages multiplayer co-op. I hope it finds a healthy community in all the platforms it is released on, because this is not a great experience if you are intending to play it only alone. There are certainly problems on a fundamental level besides its oddly tuned balance; the AI partners and camera often perform poorly, while some of its environments are straight up borderline visually unnavigable. Yet, I am left impressed with how technical the gameplay is and how carefully Artdink designed the game’s framework to emphasize teamwork and synergy above all throughout fun Gundam crossover stages. It’s not perfect, but I am thankful that this kind of game can still exist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The story of Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising might not be all that grand, but it’s full of characters that we’ve already grown to love. And so, as a taster for Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, it does its job admirably.","Eiyuden Chronicle is a quick and frothy good time - exactly the introduction to the Eiyuden universe that was needed to get players excited for the next game.

I do worry that it’s releasing a bit too early compared to the main entry and with a game focused around questing, it’s so disappointing how badly the questing system and UI is setup. There is also a lot of needless backtracking that could have been avoided.

However, it is an often thrilling, tense PvE game that implements some of the best shooting mechanics found in Siege. Rather than focusing on swarms of fast moving zombies and floods of randomized loot, Extraction keeps things simple and often muted, rewarding careful and deliberate play. It may not have deep progression and constantly evolving objectives but it does present a challenge that only Rainbow Six can bring. While Ubisoft typically supports their games for the long term, I’m curious to see if Rainbow Six Extraction will be able to shine in this increasingly busy space and prove that the risk–and lengthy delay–was mostly worth it.",,Rainbow Six Extraction is a neat standalone follow-up to Siege's Outbreak mode of 2018 – it has potential but is yet to fully realise it.,,"Rainbow Six Extraction's individual parts make for a very solid foundation, but the interesting gameplay mechanics get lost in a repetitive mission structure.",,"We can’t recommend Rainbow Six Extraction if you’re planning on playing alone, especially on PlayStation platforms where you’re expected to pay £40 for the privilege, but if your regular gaming group is bored of the game you play every night, and they all have Game Pass, Extraction will provide laughs.","With some effective gameplay mechanics and an enormous potential for feeding the game with more content in the future, Rainbow six Extraction is a safe bet for those of us who love zombies, but with a twist that is clearly oriented to being more tactical and demanding than other similar titles.",,,"While it doesn't execute fully with its foundation, it does take more risks than I expected, to the point where it's going to be worth a look for some folks.",,,"Rainbow Six Extraction is a fun, slightly different game in the cooperative shooter genre.

Sure, there’s an endless cycle of parasitic aliens invading, but I know that no matter how much time I put in, the reward for doing a good job is just going to be more work to do.","While some of Rainbow Six Extraction‘s systems do feel a little unfair at times, there’s one hell of a thrilling experience to be found if you can get into the groove. I’m not usually a fan of stealth, but sneaking around the game’s excellently-designed environments trying to get the upper hand on a bunch of freaky-as-hell aliens is exhilarating. You’re constantly on-edge, not knowing what waits around the next corner, poised to attack if you need to. Add to that a solid progression system that keeps you wanting to jump back in, and you’ve got one of Ubisoft’s best multiplayer experiences yet.","Rainbow Six Extraction offers players a surprisingly new experience, a more stealthy take on co-op shooters than is found in the competition. With blistering difficulty, tension to spare, and a delicious argument-inducing bug out mechanic, Extraction uses shooter mechanics in ways that feel utterly unique and original. Perhaps a bit light on content, but we all know that more will come in time. A stress-filled creepy good time, even for non-shooter fans.",,"Explosive, exhilarating and endlessly entertaining, Rainbow Six Extraction is arguably Ubisoft at their best and most confident.",,"Rainbow Six Extraction more or less feels like a big expansion, rather than a full game. There simply isn't enough variety in the gameplay, while the scale feels way too small as well. The inclusion of cooperative play softens the blow a little, and the shooting is a lot of fun.

At the same time, the missions are not too varied and there are some small bugs here and there. A decent game, fun to play, but nowhere very exceptional.",,"Rainbow Six: Extraction's core gameplay is decent, and its level variety is great, but the game definitely has some blind spots. While a zombie title focused on stealth and tactics makes for an interesting experience, anytime the game strays from that, it’s less successful. It draws extra attention to weak spots, like unimpressive AI and an obnoxious RNG progression system. Go in with a couple of friends, though, and you will get some fun out of this. All the levels are visually distinct and interesting to look at, and three squad members stealthing their way through a field of enemies can be immensely rewarding. It’s just unlikely to hold your attention in the long term.","Playing Rainbow Six Extraction might be challenging, but for some strange reason it is pretty entertaining. Successfully completing a mission will bring tears of joy, because of the feeling of accomplishment. Even rescuing an Operator will make you feel some relief. On the other hand, the game needs more development on its narrative and the character progression is really repetitive.",,,"An absorbing, tactical three-person co-op game that does well to expand the Rainbow Six gameplay into a more fantastical setting.","The greatest strong point of Extraction is undoubtedly to succeed in brilliantly mixing two distinctly different universes: on the one hand, the ultra-calculated military aspect of the Rainbow Six saga and, on the other, the tireless fashion of infected (or zombies) which has been attacking our favorite hobby for years.",,"Ubisoft eventually came to the realization that it was time to get this game out the door, and the result is a jumbled pile of ideas you’ve seen before, executed in a wildly uninteresting way.","Rainbow Six Extraction is a game that struggles to leave the shadow of its predecessor behind, but that sounds like a bit of an injustice too. Ubisoft has tried to replicate the success of Siege‘s Outbreak mode and the game is a fun, challenging, and competent co-op shooter for groups of three friends. Unlike other co-op shooters, it can even be enjoyed by solo players to an extent. However, the repetitive mission objectives and forced grind mean that long periods of play can become tedious. There’s also not a lot of endgame content right now to keep players coming back, unlike Siege that is still going strong many seasons later. Only time will tell if this game will achieve that longevity.",,,,,"Extraction integrates tactical and stealth elements into its co-op shooter gameplay and does a pretty good job of honoring the DNA of the Rainbow Six series. This is not its only quality, and the extraterrestrial threat is a new and welcoming setting, much better that the terrorists and zombies too often seen elsewhere.",,"Designed specifically to be played as part of an effective team, Rainbow Six Extraction is good fun like this, and undeniably less fun played any other way.

It’s carried primarily from its tactical, yet intense gameplay. In concept, it strays completely away from what actually defines a Tom Clancy game.","It’s perhaps not what Tom Clancy fans had envisioned for the series, but there’s something to Rainbow Six Extraction that's definitely worth checking out. It stands apart from similar co-op shooters thanks to that tactical edge and gunplay it's inherited from Siege. That said, the repetitive nature of running missions, difficulty spikes, and overall presentation hold the game back. This is Ubisoft we’re talking about, however, so Extraction will likely sprout a long tail that will continue to grow over the coming months and years.","Rainbow Six Extraction can be fun in a casual setting, but it caters mainly to the hardcore tactical shooter fanbase. This isn't a bad thing because it's fun as hell. Everything you do in a match is rewarded with a constant stream of in-game items and new areas, but this is only after a few hours of finding your bearings in zones and understanding mission types and operators. However, after that, the game opens up exceptionally well, with so much promise to continue with additional content and ways to strategize with friends.",,,,"Rainbow Six Extraction stealthily moves down a well-trodden path, carrying a fairly uninspired narrative that could be described as hackneyed at best. OK, as pithy summations go maybe that's a little bit harsh. Sure, this won't be winning any awards for its high concept themes or originality, but does that really matter when it's so much fun to play? While Ubisoft hasn't reinvented the wheel here, it has at least implemented enough innovative ideas in its core gameplay loop to keep potential React operators engaged in the Archaean struggle. As with any title reliant on repeated playthroughs, there's maybe a slight concern on its longevity, however the promise of regular, free content drops, should be reason enough to warrant regular revisits. It's also worth noting that it's available on Xbox Game Pass from day one, courtesy of Uncle Phil's deep pockets.",,"Net of an underlying repetitiveness that begins to emerge after a few hours of play, a non-exceptional enemy design and a series of fluctuations related to the balance of weapons and operators, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Extraction is an intense and compelling cooperative shooter , able to offer an experience different from other exponents of the genre, more oriented towards frenetic action and little to strategy.","The new PvE formula is fun and engaging. Rainbow Six Extraction feels and plays like a true Rainbow Six, yet it needs some improvements in its structures and challenges.",,,,,,"Rainbow Six Extraction is a great co-op shooter, seeing you take on hordes of aliens in squads of three.

The different alien types--while seeming overly familiar compared to other video game monsters--are fun to fight and strategize against. The objectives are fun and tense, and the ""do we continue or leave now"" choice is always filled with tension. I just wish there was more of this game to play, and that the repetition of the game didn't set in so soon. Extraction is certainly worthy of the Rainbow Six moniker, I just don't know if it will be laying Siege to the other game's fanbase anytime soon.",,"In essence, Extraction lacks excitement. More often than not it is a glorified zombie mod that would feel more at home in Siege. On the other hand, it seems somewhat of an odd experiment whose existence is difficult to justify. The result is an experience lacking in content which to newcomers might still end up feeling hostile while at the same time alienating veterans of the franchise.",,If you are the type of person who liked the tactical aspects of Rainbow Six: Siege but was put off by the PvP elements then Extraction is just the tactical experience you will really enjoy.,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rainbow Six Extraction is a good PvE shooter that works very well when played with friends and offers great gunplay.

Its combat can be furious and fun, but some missions suffer from repetition, some mechanical weirdness and poor pacing. Chorus takes itself and its story too seriously for its own good. In place of plain, old fashioned joy at blowing up stuff in space, we get angsty, mystical mumbo jumbo and a spacecraft with a guilt complex.",,"In the end, Chorus provided a great experience overall. While a few kinks need working out, the amount of entertainment I got from it greatly surpassed my expectations and will surely satisfy fans of the genre.",,,,,,,,,"Chorus does an admirable job of trying to carve out its own identity in a genre that deserves the attention, but it just doesn't stick the landing. If you're a fan of arcade spaceship shooters and narrative adventures there's probably enough here to chew over, but there's just not much that Chorus has to offer that hasn't already been done better elsewhere. Despite being set in a gorgeous pocket of space and offering up some interesting ideas it sadly misses the mark in just about every way.",,,Chorus provides both solid space dogfights with intuitive controls and a distinctly presented story that remains engaging throughout. It may have its maddening moments that hold it back from greatness but it's still an impressively promising original IP.,,,,,,"Chorus is a title that flew under the radar and that's a shame, because the game does good things in certain areas. Flying the spaceship is a real pleasure, with the developer coming close to perfection in terms of control. The battles are also very intense, which is a real pleasure, but bear in mind that the pace will be somewhat disrupted later in the game. It can also get a little monotonous in the end, but don't let that stop you from giving the game a chance. You will be surprised.",,"Although the basic storyline may be largely nonsensical, you'll come across a nice selection of characters to assist on your travels, all of whom are fully voice acted with their own minor backstories. Nara and Forsaken often exchange pleasantries, but their conversations can sometimes come across a bit clinical, and would have benefited greatly from a bit of added humour.","Chorus is a pleasant surprise to finish 2021. Its satisfying combat, rewarding exploration, and beautiful galactic scenarios make it easy to recommend this title.","A bit of a surprise, this one, a full-blooded space shooter that could sometimes throw a bit less at you but in the end stays fun and engaging. What a debut for the inexperienced team!",,"An extremely solid space combat simulator that struggles in terms of storytelling, and doesn’t entirely justify its open world approach, but still offers an enjoyably unique experience.","Despite a few flaws, in particular with regard to the structure of the scenario, the excessive presence of dialogues, an insignificant soundtrack and framerate drops, Chorus is the nice surprise of the end of 2021.",,,,,,,,,,"Much more than a shooting gallery, Chorus is an enjoyable adventure that stumbles a bit over its own design.

Dogfighting in space never felt so responsive or satisfying and the backdrops can be stunning.

The storytelling, the UI and the quest design, on the other hand, are far from perfect.",,,,,,,,,,"Chorus does an excellent job of cutting out the dull parts of space dogfighting, getting right to the flashy fun of blasting through enemy fighters and capital ships with superpowered abilities. Its large and pretty map is filled with fleshed-out side quests, and they’re varied enough that it’s easy to cruise around for a few dozen hours and really get the hang of the combat system. The story behind it all isn’t half bad once you’ve waded through a flood of sci-fi mysticism, and Nara and Forsaken are interesting characters to spend all that time with – which is a relief, because they’re the only ones we ever get to see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chorus is a space-combat shooter with a good personality, where intense intergalactic dogfights represent the most successful part of the game that is supported by an appreciable artistic direction. It's not perfect but it offers valid reasons to be played, especially by those who love space-themed shooters.","Chorus is an excellent space combat game with ships that, although it doesn't stand out in anything, it fulfills all its aspects. And that, on many occasions, is better than being overly ambitious and that penalizes the final result. We especially highlight its combat system, which is arcade and simple for all tastes; as well as its narrative, which from the beginning gives off a special aroma, and keeps us hooked as we progress.",,,,,"There are not that many space combat games out there, so Chorus could be a good pick if you like an action packed and ready-to-go game that doesn’t require you to study astrophysics like Elite o Star Citizen. The drawback is that, mechanics wise, Chorus is fairly repetitive, and not that mechanically deep. It could still be a good choice if you’re aching to shoot space lasers, but in a couple of hours you might realize you’re becoming more of a space tourist than an ace pilot.",,,,,,,,"Chorus is visually convincing, with a great gameplay, but too repetitive to go through, especially since the story remains pretty uninteresting despite all its efforts.",,,,,,,,,,,"It feels like Chorus has been flying under the radar ahead of its release, but in the wake of Dune’s cinematic release, it now feels like it’s arriving at the perfect time for anyone wanting another dose of space weirdness. Its mix of mechanics and magic, of sci-fi and fantasy – and even notes of horror – aren’t entirely unique, but they are arranged in a way that will feel innovative and fresh to many.

I hope we get more bosses released and new areas released over time, if this game gets some decent support I could see it growing.

Much more. If Arcadegeddon is to succeed in the MMO/roguelite space in the longer term, some of the advancement mechanics (such as preserving progress of longer runs) and lategame gameplay needs to be refined and expanded. I want additional modes like time trials that can easily and reliably completed in a single sitting. At the same time, I want some additional variety to make a three hour gauntlet exciting to reach.

The characters are at the center of the experience and we appreciate this more relaxed tone that offers something very cinematic with a classic and realistic gameplay that always works very well. An episode of quality even if it lacks a bit of the spectacular.","Aside from breath-taking visuals, the campaign mode of Vanguard doesn’t have much to say, as it’s the standard short and sweet Call of Duty campaign that we’ve known for years, but when it comes to multiplayer Vanguard is a beast, offering the most content than any other COD game before with some top notch map design and super smooth gameplay.",,"Call of Duty: Vanguard is a very problematic game, that game at a very wrong time for Activision. Bad maps and uninspiring multiplayer and zombies modes are accompanied with a good story to create the game that needs to challenge both Halo Infinite and Battlefield 2042 for the throne. As a long time series fan - I wish them the best of luck - they're fighting an uphill battle here.","Even though the campaign is extremely predictable and the multiplayer is plagued with tones of issues, Call Of Duty: Vanguard is, after all, still a Call of Duty title, and will appeal to all hardcore Call of Duty fans.","Undead-battling co-op survival mode Zombies – an acquired taste I’ve regrettably never managed to stomach to any degree – rounds out a solid portion of CoD that can’t quite shake the notion it’s merely providing target practice until Vanguard’s Pacific-themed Warzone map enters the fray next month. Then again, perhaps that’s actually the point.",,Call of Duty: Vanguard is not the full package fans have and should expect from a franchise that consistently tops the sales charts. There are not enough positives to overcome the fact that the amount and quality of its content is sorely lacking. This is a blast from the past in the worst possible way.,"Vanguard’s multiplayer offers only fleeting moments of fun right now, but its core issues can all be solved in time. Sledgehammer’s philosophy when it comes to maps and attachments means that, right now, you rarely get the optimum experience, but with dedicated spaces for competitive players it might well become the competitive Call of Duty game we’ve been waiting for. [Multiplayer Review Score = 70]","Call of Duty: Vanguard brings us a great mixture of thrilling story campaign, fresh multiplayer modes and an innovative Zombie mode. It is a fantastic experience for fans of the series and the 1st person shooters as well.","Overall, it feels like a game that doesn't want to disturb and has no soul of its own.",,,,"It’s a great shooter game, CoD always is, but it's not the best in the series and the overly used WW2 backdrop is wearing thin. The pandemic would have played a part in this and kudos to the developers for still delivering a big game despite the lockdowns.","Call of Duty: Vanguard is another strong entry for the franchise. It offers a lackluster campaign, but makes up for it with a frenetic and fun multiplayer experience. It doesn't bring anything new to the table in the FPS genre, but many of its elements definitely feel like an evolution for the franchise.",,,"Call of Duty: Vanguard is a standout shooter experience. A globetrotting campaign that features some of the franchise’s best visuals features a core mystery that is over far too quickly but remains strong. I also wish the Zombies mode wasn’t impacted by a content drop that is expected a month from launch, meaning that players are given an engaging but sometimes toothless wave-based assault on the undead. Yet the multiplayer is an exceptional entry at the heart of Vanguard. It offers refinement on the standard set by Modern Warfare and gives players an incredible amount of challenges to complete to best show off their combat prowess. While a new Warzone map isn’t here yet, there’s plenty to look forward to in the months to come. Despite skipping a year, Sledgehammer Games is at its peak with Call of Duty: Vanguard, delivering a premium World War II shooter and an incredible Call of Duty game.",,A solid installment for the series with a satisfying story and great multiplayer balance.,,,,"At launch, Call of Duty Vanguard feels like a solid step-up from Black Ops Cold War, but falls short of the benchmark that was Modern Warfare 2019.

Yet the authenticity of the Second World War is all but gone, with missing historical maps, teams and uniforms, leaving me wondering why the developers even chose this setting to begin with.","This is a good installment, but the stutter in combat makes me wonder if it’s as polished as it should be. The game has crashed on me sometimes during Blitz modes in particular, with a lot of players. But overall it held up tremendously well in multiplayer as I fought my way to the first Prestige level and got through it with a 0.84 kill/death ratio. In fact, the more I played the more I enjoyed multiplayer.",,"Does Call of Duty: Vanguard advance the series in any meaningful way? Of course not, but that doesn’t stop it from being a fantastic package for Call of Duty fans, or a good entry point for those seeking a way in. The campaign here is brief but captivating, managing to make you feel for its band of heroes despite your short time with them. Zombies has some interesting twists that keep you on your toes. And multiplayer is more of the same but with tweaks that some will love and others will hate, as usual. All in all, this is one of the best Call of Duty releases to date, and we’d love to see more of Vanguard’s exploits in the future.","It follows the formula of a Call of Duty game, but delivers each element just a bit worse than it's predecessors. Call of Duty: Vanguard is a game that will surely grow and improve over time, but what we have at launch is something that at least fails to cater to what I was hoping for in any aspect of the game. The single player campaign is ridiculous even if it does deliver some moments of high action; the multiplayer is a mess, at least for someone with my skillset; and zombies is simply unfinished. It'll get better, but what we've got right now just isn't all that good.","If you enjoy WWII shooters, you’ll still have a good time with Call of Duty: Vanguard. Sledgehammer Games have graced the WWII era once again with their innovative approach to multiplayer and packed it full of maps. The campaign, albeit short, gives you a unique view of WWII at the heart of one of the deadliest squads. And the Zombies mode? It exists, but the less said about it, the better.","Call of Duty: Vanguard's campaign is meaty, the Battle Pass will keep you going a while, and Zombies is wonderfully addictive.",,"Whilst Call of Duty Vanguard does not innovate much to push the boundaries of the franchise further, The WWII shooter does deliver a compelling experience. The short, but action-packed single-player offers a nice introduction, although it could be a bit more coherent. The zombies' mode offers some new elements, while still feeling trusted. But by far the biggest reason to like Vanguard is multiplayer. With a nice selection of maps, plenty of modes, and some tweaks to the known formula, it truly delivers.","Even failing at ""showing World Wart Two like never before"", Call of Duty Vanguard is a great FPS. Campaign is full of epic (and some dramatic) moments, multiplayer is fun and fast, and includes 16 maps (twice as the previous Call of Duty game) with plenty of modes and progression elements, and the new zombies mode is incredibly fun.","Vanguard doesn’t stray too far away from the classic Call of Duty formula we have come to expect from the franchise over the past several years. In many ways, it’s a little more of the same. That said, Call of Duty: Vanguard is an incredibly robust package offering up tons of content for the buck. Zombies mode is far more enjoyable and varied, the single-player campaign is a visual stunner, and 20 MP maps at launch is nothing to sneeze at. If you have passed over Call of Duty over the last several years, it might be time to come back.","Call of Duty: Vanguard is one of the most anticipated shooters of the year, a year in which Battlefield was knocking on the door. While they do not risk in its highlights, they reinforce a game system that works this time as a complement to Warzone but an incentive to the height, with an outstanding campaign and multiplayer mode but with a forgettable zombie mode that does not detract from the fun that has given me Vanguard in all the hours I've played.","Although a solid offering overall, one can’t help but feel that the series has taken a step backwards in terms of the content available as well as the era depicted.",,,,,,,,,"Iterating on what Call of Duty diehards know and love, Vanguard has the potential to stand up alongside some of the series' best. Whether it be a bombastic, action-flick inspired campaign, endlessly addictive multiplayer or now-staple zombies mode, the game feels like comfort food. However, I remain doubtful that the game's new and updated modes will do enough to win over anyone that wasn't convinced with earlier iterations.","Call of Duty: Vanguard may be the best CoD installment to date with stunning graphics that shine on the new systems and finely tuned, balanced gun play. They bring a new and fresh approach to the WWII and D-Day scenario making the solo campaign just as enjoyable as the multiplayer.",,,,,"After the disappointing Cold War, Vanguard was the game that many fans have put their faith in. But due to rocky start, the countless bugs the completely unbalanced multiplayer and the incomplete zombies mode, this year’s Call of Duty is just another nail in the coffin of once great franchise. Shaken by various scandals on every front, it is clear that Activision does not care about anything else just cashing in the yearly checks. It is sad that the collaboration between Sledgehammer, Treyarch, Raven Software, Beenox and Highmoon cannot produce something more than Vanguard. The first Warzone season might improve things starting with 2nd of December, but I will not hold my breath.","Call of Duty Vanguard is a good vintage. Far from being revolutionary, he at least has the will to offer a new perspective on World War II. We quickly become attached to this motley group. It is especially on the multiplayer side that there is much to say. The good idea is to take the gameplay of Modern Warfare to the letter, or even too literally, because this brings the flaws of the title of Infinity Ward. Activision doesn't want to jostle gamers, offering content that has been seen and reviewed for years while adding a few well-felt niceties like Champion of the Hill mode. Clearly, the multiplayer is a bit above Cold War, would be only in the sensations controller in hand and on the gunplay in a general way. Call of Duty Vanguard is not the opus of the revolution, but clearly does the job, offering agame that will hold up for the year to come.","Call of Duty: Vanguard is built like a rollercoaster so you have your highs, your lows, and moments that flatline. There’s no question its three modes are fun to play and offer fans enough content to keep them busy for some time, but this is Call of Duty, after all. Until Activision does something completely different with the series, don’t expect it to feel too different each year.","Call of Duty: Vanguard contains a single-player campaign that is very promising on paper, but lacks the exciting finesse of previous Call of Duty games. On the other side, the multiplayer is fun and has a lot of good designed maps. The Zombies mode misses the mark completely with re-used assets being used from the rest of the game, simple to be filled with zombies, lacking any intriguing parts what makes zombies worthwhile. The whole game is technically a mess, but luckily the online part is fun.",,"Call of Duty: Vanguard is another incredibly solid but also super safe instalment in the series. Its campaign may be over in a hurry but it's still a fairly memorable one, featuring good characters and outstanding visuals. Multiplayer is another robust package, hosting a ton of content and the promise of more to come. The less said about Zombies the better, but this is a Call of Duty game doing Call of Duty things. Whether that's of any interest or not, you likely already know.","The campaign of Call of Duty: Vanguard tries to be heroic, but falls short and becomes predictable due to one-dimensional characters with poor development. Even when the multiplayer has interesting gameplay options, they are nothing to write home about. Finally, the zombie mode adds a lot of entertainment to the experience, but it's not enough for this installment to be a must-buy.",,"With a reasonable campaign, a great multiplayer mode and a good but scanty Zombies mode, Call of Duty: Vanguard is a nice new part. Whether that is enough is something you know best.","A reliable entry full of variety and worthwhile content, that simultaneously leaves an aroma of staleness that is beginning to taint the whole Call Of Duty franchise.","Like every year, Call of Duty tries to satisfy all gamers, no matter what they are looking for. Solo adventure, multi-competitive, collaborative zombie, free-to-play battle royale. A turnkey offer, XXL menu style, which this year lacks care at launch. We see it through the countryside which despite its exoticism offers nothing exceptional or memorable to experience. This is also seen in Zombie Mode, which at launch is only a rough sketch of what it should be and unfortunately lacks content. In the equation, the multi comes out with its head held high, offering several well-felt new features and still lively gameplay. More and more turned towards the “live service” and the updates of season, Call of Duty signs, with Vanguard, an episode of end of cycle, which asks only to evolve to improve and which turns out to be more enjoyable overall than the overall experience of Black Ops Cold War.","Its narrative is fractious and slight, compared to Sledgehammer’s previous work, but the chance for a chaotic, target-rich experience with friends exerts a stronger pull than usual.",,"As a complete package, from a Call of Duty developer that hasn’t yet established its own Modern Warfare or Black Ops sub-franchise, Vanguard feels like it could end up being Sledgehammer’s tentpole. Iconic characters, unique multiplayer and map design, and overall integration into the wider Call of Duty experience set the pace for not only the next year, but whatever comes next from Sledgehammer.","A lackluster campaign, a soulless Zombies mode, and a fun but diminished multiplayer offering round out a rather weak launch for the iconic FPS series.",Call of Duty: Vanguard has a solid and fun multiplayer mode as well as a jaw-dropping technical outfit. Too bad that the single player has not enjoyed the same care and presents itself as one of the least convincing experiences in the history of the brand.,"Vanguard builds on the three pillars that fans of Call of Duty have come to expect. The problem: While the multiplayer mode plays great, the campaign is visually and acoustically well staged, but overall it's only ""very solid"" due to the weak AI and a far too predictable and short story. The zombie mode, on the other hand, is more beginner-friendly than ever, but the bottom line is that it disappoints, especially long-time fans, with an abundance of missing features. Provided that upcoming content updates improve the situation, there is still hope that the developers will make zombie hunters happy in the long run.",,"Sledgehammer Games is back after 4 years and they are coming back in great shape.

But unlike the source material, Vanguard won't live long in the memory.",,,,"It will feel familiar to anyone who has picked up a controller and jumped into any of the past two dozen iterations of the franchise. More importantly, though, Vanguard is a Call of Duty game because of the role it proudly plays as a mythmaking vehicle.","Sledgehammer Games clearly had high ambitions when approaching their third solo Call of Duty project. Doubling down on World War II was a smart idea to help the studio carve out its own identity separate from Infinity Ward and Treyarch. While Call of Duty: Vanguard doesn’t break the mold, it does succeed on most fronts, delivering one of the better multiplayer experiences in years for the franchise and a simplified Zombies mode that lowers the barrier of entry for those intimidated by past iterations.",,"Vanguard is a game with plenty of multiplayer content, far from the best ones but still enjoyable, and a campaign whose purpose seems to tick a box.",Call of Duty Vanguard is a solid yet unremarkable entry in the long running franchise. On a technical level it’s one of the most impressive games out there right now. On a gameplay level it’s nothing you haven’t seen before.,"The stars have aligned for Call of Duty: Vanguard. For the first time, this truly feels like a full package without any caveats. Sure, some parts are naturally stronger than others but there isn’t a weak link in sight. After back to back triumphs, Call of Duty is now on a killstreak.",,,"Offering a trilogy of solid content offerings with campaign, multiplayer and zombies, Call of Duty: Vanguard is a valiant attempt from Sledgehammer which maybe plays it a little too safe in the end. Despite the messy, disjointed design choices for online, Vanguard still proves to be a satisfying experience. It may not lead the line of CoD entries as its name suggests, but it nestles nicely in the middle of the pack.",,"Call of Duty: Vanguard is a great Call of Duty entry with absolutely stellar ser pieces, fantastic visuals, and plenty of modes surrounding an excellently fun campaign. The only downsides are the muddied stories… not to mention what is happening in the company that published it. Highly recommended for CoD fans and people looking for a bit of mindless fun set in WW2.","The frame rate appears anchored to 60 frames, without particular uncertainties, while the soundtrack signed by Bear McCreary boasts an excellent main theme and, in general, effectively accompanies the action.","Call of Duty Vanguard is a particular episode, a collage of experiences that do not all have the same inspiration and quality. There is a very effective but not very original PvP, a short and breathless campaign, a Zombie mode that is almost a reward, with the promise of progressively growing. Depending on your needs, then decide whether or not to approach this year's chapter: if you like the cooperative experience against hordes of undead, you will probably just need a little patience.",,"Call of Duty: Vanguard brings a surprisingly engaging campaign and some amazing graphics. While some character flashbacks are better than others, and the length is a bit disappointing, the campaign is nevertheless a fun jot through the theatres of WWII.",,,,"Call of Duty: Vanguard brings some interesting improvements to the multiplayer mode and the gameplay is quick and deadly -a departure from last year’s Black Ops: Cold War. On the downside it makes you feel that you are playing a modern shooter and not a WWII one. The campaign looks great, although it doesn’t contain any memorable moments. Zombies mode is even more accessible to new players, but is in dire need of content.",,"Call of Duty: Vanguard is a brave and accomplished charge from Activision into World War II. The intelligent way the campaign was assembled escaping from documented events but honoring the different archetypes of the piece combatants, made us sorry that we are not standing in front of a game with a heavier single player component. The core of CoD really is the multiplayer experience which seems faster and with various experiences but with the same good old feel, albeit with an MP40 in hand.",,,"With a strong cast of characters used to varying effect throughout to tell a tale that puts just about enough of a spin on the stories it's paying homage to, Call of Duty: Vanguard’s single-player campaign is an impressively cinematic depiction of World War II. That said, aside from a few standout moments sprinkled over its fleeting five hours, for the most part it plays it a little too safe in regards to mission variety to feel like a standout in the series. It may look and sound spectacular, but it could’ve used more stylish sections like Petrova’s to distinguish its gameplay from the many battles we’ve fought before. [Single-Player Campaign Review score = 70]",,,,,,"For those looking for more of the same, Call of Duty: Vanguard does exactly that. It’s the same, great-feeling FPS with a fresh lick of WWII paint complete with all of the weapons, locales and caveats that come with it. It’s not a revolutionary entry for the series, but it’s not a particularly poor one, either.","Compared to Black Ops Cold War, Vanguard has a vastly improved multiplayer that feels like a solid foundation for Sledgehammer Games to build on throughout the seasons of post-launch content but with an underwhelming campaign and Zombies mode that seemingly needs a lot of work to win back the hardcore fans, it's not a bad Call of Duty title but it's certainly not one of the very best...Having spent several hours playing all three modes, I can safely say that it's definitely worth buying, specifically for the multiplayer which is surprisingly good for a change.","Call of Duty: Vanguard is As Expected: The Video Game. You get the polish, the excitement, the rush the series always delivers within the stylised World War 2 setting. This year, the single-player campaign is undoubtedly the standout action blockbuster, with the Multiplayer serving chaotic fun and Zombies mode failing to try something different. Pick it up if you’re already a fan.",,,,,,,"Call of Duty: Vanguard is certainly a good return to World War II by Sledgehammer, especially in terms of multiplayer modes: many maps, customizable weapons with numerous options and a progression system to applause. On the other hand, the single player campaign is just enough, far from being considered epic, while the Zombies mode needs to be expanded as soon as possible.",,,,,,,,,,,"Call of Duty: Vanguard reminds us of the Call of Duty titles from over 15 years ago. And there is nothing wrong with a somewhat stripped-down reboot, but in this case, it feels like a lack of development time is the main reason for the cutbacks. The single player campaign looks terrific and plays great but has very few memorable moments. The zombie mode on the other hand lacks a lot of content at launch. Luckily, the main online mode offers plenty of content and the gameplay is as addicting as ever – even though everything feels very familiar.",,,"Despite recurring flaws, Call of Duty Vanguard manages to be convincing with its interesting campaign and its rich multiplayer. The zombie mode should have been fully stuffed at launch though. Once more, perfection is not for this year, but the new Call of is still OK.",,,,,"The thing about Call of Duty games is that, with each yearly iteration, you pretty much know what you're getting--and that's largely the case here. It's both a blessing and a curse for Vanguard, however. Elements of Vanguard feel like good additions to the franchise, but its ideas also don't always mix well with the series' framework. That framework is still strong, and the solid gunplay, exciting multiplayer, and inventive moments of the campaign are worth seeking out. But forcing those two parts together exposes the seams in Call of Duty: Vanguard at times, weakening both parts of the game rather than pushing either one to the forefront.","Even with a lacklustre Zombies experience, Call of Duty: Vanguard is Sledgehammer Games’ best Call of Duty to date. The studio is finally hitting its stride in getting its vision of the series to where it should be. The campaign is a rip-roaring five hours of fascinating character stories mixed with memorable locales, while the new additions to the admittedly by-the-numbers multiplayer are more than welcome. While it may not change the formula in any meaningful way, what you’ve got here is a great Call of Duty game.","Once reinforcements do come for Zombies, it will be hard to argue against Vanguard as one of the best and most complete Call of Duty titles in the last decade, potentially of the franchise's entire history. This is one of the rare times Call of Duty has seriously dug into its past, learned from it, and delivered a new and improved experience. Vanguard sets a high bar for Call of Duty as the franchise moves into the next generation.",,,,,"While it adds some interesting new features to the Call of Duty formula, Vanguard's mixed bag of changes makes it a forgettable entry.",,,,,"Well-curated and polished trip to battlefields of WWII in the campaign mode is worth remembering mostly for its work with lights and shadows. You will fear for your life, crawling through the night before D-Day or Pacific jungle – which is undoubtedly a good thing. The multiplayer is a completely different experience though. This is not a WWII shooter anymore but rather a Fortnite-inspired battle arena with some WWII skins and guns. Is it realistic? Hell no. Is it fun to play? Hell yeah.",,"Perhaps the softest launch in Activision Blizzard's historic FPS series, Call of Duty Vanguard shows that there's much potential for this year's entry to grow. However with the weakest Zombies mode in series history, a shortage of cosmetics and upgrades for anything save your primary loadout, and a Campaign that could've offered so much more, Vanguard is a tough sell if you're looking for anything than your next TDM fix at the moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vanguard is an incremental iteration for the Call of Duty franchise. It’s a solid entry in the series that does well what Call of Duty does well, but it doesn’t stand-out as a landmark release. If you enjoy Call of Duty, haven’t played for a few years, or are new to franchise, then by all means jump in. The water’s fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By positioning itself as a complete experience, with dozens of hours of content to play through, along with engaging, varied, and deep combat, it exceeds expectations and manages to lay a firm foundation for a franchise that I hope manifests itself in the future.",,"A cooperative game with fast pace, and though it has some technical issues and a lot of loading screens, the game will still give you tens of hours of gameplay.",Outriders is much more than meets the eye. People Can Fly have done a superb job in delivering a self-sustaining looter shooter that manages to execute on some great ideas.,"What sets Outriders apart from genre rivals like Borderlands and Destiny are the RPG elements that allow you - just like in a role-playing game - to shape and build your character so that he (or she) is completely customized to your individual play style. The result is an ambitious and highly enjoyable science fiction game that will keep you busy for several hours on your own, in pairs or in threes.",,"Outriders could have been a great looter-shooter, but with its unbalanced structure and current instability, it’s hard to recommend.",,,,,"Outriders is a fresh, new IP. While it’s getting compared to others in the genre constantly, it stands alone as its own game and unique idea. I for one can’t wait to see where Square Enix and People Can Fly take the concept. There is a wealth of good here and you can see its promise for a long time to come.",,"When People Can Fly does let you loose across its array of semi-open zones, Outriders quickly reveals its strengths as a pulpy, pacey looter shooter with surprising levels of depth. [Review in Progress]",,,,"Outriders is its own greatest victim. There are some decent ideas in here – an absorbing cauldron of combat variables, some majestic geography, even a few guns worth holding onto – but they're dragged down and suffocated by a game that doesn't want to entertain you but hypnotise you with the prospect of another trinket.",,,,"It’s a lower bar to clear to be sure, but People Can Fly have delivered what Bungie and other studios can’t seem to do these days: a complete $60 game.","This game has no roadmap to wait on or microtransactions to dodge, as People Can Fly has focused solely on making a damn good third-person co-op shooter with a huge variety of weapon and ability combos that keep the action aggressive and satisfying. Sure, it doesn’t innovate in any huge way and its many flaws are tough to ignore, but Outriders is a blast from a simpler past and I love that.",,"Not one boring second during battles, and getting new gear never gets tired. Outriders works very well.",,,"The real draw here is the captivating looter-shooter action that grabs you early on and simply doesn’t let go. You’ll love running into each combat encounter, commanding the battlefield like the Altered being that you are, before sweeping up any loot left by those you’ve slain. Then, back at camp, you’ll paw over your stats, improving and modding your gear as you see fit, before heading out into the fray once again. To play Outriders is to become engrossed in it, whether you’re alone or with others. Needless to say, it might just prove to be the biggest surprise of the year.",Outriders is far from perfect. But a game doesn't have to be when it facilitates such a high degree of fun and interesting gameplay mechanics.,,"Despite a largely forgettable story and a few misfires, Outriders is a great looter shooter that feels satisfying to play alone or with others and easily holds its own among contemporaries.","Not everyone is looking for a game like Outriders, and if wooden dialogue and sci-fi cliches – it’s all commanders with eye patches and mad scientists – are not your thing, there’s no shame in that. But if you’re the type of player who reached a flow state in Doom Eternal, or speaks wistfully of Diablo, or perhaps remembers the rhythmic gunnery of Bizarre Creations’ The Club, Outriders will speak to you.",,"Either solo or multiplayer, Outriders is a fun, fast paced shooter, full of great moments. People Can Fly delivers great combat mechanics and RPG elements, but we have the feeling we´ve seen most elements in other games. We love that Outriders is not designed as ""game as a service"".","What we have here are two stories told with mixed results. The grim, gorgeous sci-fi saga fell flat for me. I couldn’t get invested in this last leg of the human race turning to tribalism and violence in the face of adversity. I’m pretty bored with ‘special soldier saves the day’ stories. But the loot cycle was a different matter. This tale of frustration, anticipation, determination, and joy was immediately compelling. I dug into the mechanical guts early and easily. The combat is varied, breathless, and brutal. The character progression is a decent mix of stats and skills, there’s a ton of customization to mess around with, and the difficulty scaling is perfectly fluid. I can tolerate a lot of nonsense in exchange for a good gameplay loop. But if you’re hoping for a package as good as the prize, you might be disappointed. So long as you’re prepared to dig a little for that glittering pearl, there’s a ton of fun to be had with Outriders.","Outriders may seem like a generic adventure, but it's one of the best third person shooters we've been dealing with lately. With a wide range of enemies, scenarios and arsenals and a good handful of hours ahead. But its Achilles heel are the cinematics and the story about the planet Enoch that People Can Fly wants to tell us.",,,,,"People Can Fly couldn't have dreamed of a better time to launch their new game - with no big, new titles on the horizon. Outriders became a success almost off the bat and deservedly so, since it is a great shooter. A well-thought-out and splendidly designed Diablo-like action game.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Outriders is an OK RPG shooter that can be thrilling in it gunfights, but it never takes off. Its weak narrative and numerous bugs and crashes and lack of memorable moments prevent it from sitting next to the most successful online TPS.",,"Outriders' best quality is its addictive gameplay. Add to this an admirable amount of options and you'll find yourself constantly coming back for more. Unfortunately, there are some downsides here as well. The story isn't all that interesting, the levels start to look the same after a while and the enemy AI doesn't complement the game's cover system. Still, while you're playing Outriders, you're bound to have some fun.",,"Outriders absolutely excels when it lets combat, solid gunplay, and supremely satisfying abilities do the talking. Its unique blend of aggression really is something to behold in action. Rubbish characters, the requirement to maintain an online connection and couple with servers, and various technical hitches hold it back from greatness, but they don't muddy the picture so much to dissuade a recommendation. Outriders is pretty class in motion.","Outriders gives players that innovation that lately seems to be fading away from video games, at least on a mechanical level, since the narrative ends up being flat and unappealing. In its more than 25 hours of campaign you will experience moments that will put you to the test, and they are really worth living, but we must say that the post-game is not so interesting.",,,"A surprising, old school looter propped up by a contained sci-fi campaign, ferocious combat, and a modding system that encourages endless creativity.","Outriders does not revolutionize the genre, and does not have the ambition to do so. The title from People Can Fly and Square Enix recites the ranges of the perfect Looter-Shooter while abandoning the Game as a Service dimension inherent in this type of game. It stands out first and foremost with its science-fiction-inspired universe, fantasy and punk movement. The explosiveness of its combat, its extremely well thought-out customization system and this propensity to motivate players with ubiquitous power gain make this Shooter-RPG an outsider to consider. However, the anecdotal scenario, the sketchy staging, the redundancy of the missions and the instability of the game do not allow Outriders to fully assert itself on the Looter-Shooter scene.",,,"Outriders is simply and unapologetically Outriders. And that’s what, despite its flaws, makes it stand tall. Because it owns its flaws and rough spots, all weathered with pride through a launch period that was as rough as the Outriders first landing on Enoch. Riding out that storm offers an experience that is simply fun to play, and its something that I consistently can’t wait to get back to. High risk, high reward gameplay and crafting very tight and specific builds leads to an endlessly engaging gameplay loop. Balancing the power fantasy with challenge for players is a difficult task, but Outriders manages it well. It’s far from a perfect game, but it’s so undeniably honest in its pursuit of being exactly what it is that there’s nothing else quite like it out there. And that itself is what makes Outriders so compelling. Because Outriders is just Outriders.",,,,,"Without revolutionizing the shooter-looter genre in any way, Outriders does things efficiently and offers frenetic non-stop action that goes frankly well with co-op play. Too bad the game is repetitive and subject to technical instability, which spoils the game experience.",,"Though it lacks invention, the solid narrative approach and satisfying endgame ensures Outriders escapes the repetitive trappings of the loot shooter genre.

Offering gunplay that feels solid and satisfying and an array of additional powers and abilities to keep combat fresh and exciting, I can only admit that Outriders has surprised me in all the right ways. Maybe it'll surprise you, too.",,"Outriders is a strange beast that won’t work for everyone, especially when the servers are down. But it mostly clicked with me. The use of looter shooter mechanics in a single-player experience with a solid narrative filled with fun, self-aware dialogue kept me playing even when fights got a bit annoying or missions were too long. Outriders isn’t a new Destiny or Warframe, and that’s fine. I’m happy that Outriders tries to be something different and more self-contained. It might limit its longevity, but it was nice to play something that was an adventure and not a treadmill covered in bad loot and battle passes.",,,"Outriders is an exciting evolution of the third-person shooter genre, with thrilling sci-fi powers and satisfying gunplay that makes nearly every battle feel fast-paced and gripping until the last enemy drops. The memorable planet of Enoch alongside a steady flow of loot with plenty of promising ways to mod and enhance your weapons and armor are both strong motivators to see the game to its conclusion and beyond, even when the story does little to intrigue and the server issues plague both the solo and co-op experiences. Additional mission variety could have helped keep the game feel fresh for a little while longer, but with such deep and engaging combat that evolves alongside the player thanks to the innovative world tier system, Outriders is sure to please players looking for the next great looter shooter.",,"Outriders is a fun game that does get many things right, even though it certainly lacks some personality and new ideas, as well as some fixes on the technical side.",,"Outriders juggles some truly captivating ideas for the looter shooter genre, yet fails to deftly execute them. While it succeeds in combining traditional third person shooting with rewarding dungeon crawling, its messy matchmaking, repetitive mission design, and a dull sci-fi story hold People Can Fly back from delivering to their fullest potential.",,,,,,,"Despite the obvious uncertainties in the first game sequences, Outriders managed to win us over. What might have seemed a classic shooter in dynamics and uncertain in the story has instead proved to be a shooter with addictive gameplay, and capable of distinguishing itself for the density and richness of content. Unfortunately, the campaign remains subdued on the narrative front, but the gameplay sculpted by People Can Fly has something magnetic.","Outriders is a rare example of a complete looter-shooter, with fun combat mechanics but a lack of ambition as you play through the story and its endgame.",,,,,,"Outriders does a decent job outgrowing its reputation as a third person Destiny clone. Offering solid shooting mechanics, a surprisingly meaty story campaign and fun and intuitive character development system it earns a place as one of the best third person shooters to arrive this year.

The game doesn’t end when the credits roll, and there’s still so much left I can do. Not to mention, I could always re-roll another class. With all that though, I somehow don’t think People Can Fly is done with Enoch just yet. There is so much potential in this world, and it will be exciting to see what comes next.",,,,"Outriders is not a perfect game by any means. Its narrative, while containing some fun characters, feels somewhat underdeveloped. The conflict between the intended aggressive style of play and the omnipresent walls for cover lead to a strange kind of dissonance where the level design feels at odds with the most fun way of playing the game. The server issues are ongoing and can occasionally make the game inaccessible. The endgame is a lot of fun, but only if you’re playing in a group. When the experience is working well, it is a ton of fun shooting your way through hordes of enemies and marvelling at the latest rare gear. However, while the flaws do not ruin the experience, they are notable.",,"Outriders is a pleasantly brutal shooter, but in terms of gameplay and storytelling it is ill-conceived, while showing too many smaller and bigger flaws.",,,,,"Outriders is a looter shooter that offers many hours of fun to players, despite some structural problems such as the absence of heterogeneity in the missions. The strong point, however, is fast-paced and explosive gameplay that is well-supported by interesting RPG mechanics.",,"Outriders doesn't revolutionize any type of genre, and it's not trying to (nor does it have to). From what I’ve played so far, what Outriders provides is a well-thought-out shooter experience with expertly tailored RPG twists. It's an enjoyable ride that is made infinitely better by playing with friends, but not inherently hurt by running solo either. This game takes the best of looter-shooters and the best of sci-fi RPGs and blends these elements into a game experience that is worth diving into because of its high replayability, customizable play style, and fun story.",,,"Outriders’ stellar gunplay and abilities make for a standout take on the cover-shooter genre, even though the overall experience is dragged down by server instability.",,,,,,,,,,"Outriders blends frenetic combat and hard hitting class skills to make each encounter feel tense and rewarding. Chasing loot drops and collecting mods to bolster your collection is as addictive as using storm whip on vulnerable foes. The presentation makes it hard to connect with the characters, but players willing to read a lot may be surprised by how much thought has been put into things behind the scenes. With the current state of problems however, waiting a bit longer for things to get sorted out is recommended.",,"I hope the servers hold up going forward, but for all of its issues, when all of Enoch is in working order, Outriders' spectacle and progression are quite a rewarding experience I want to keep returning to for a long time.","While it might appear to be just another cover shooter on the surface, Outriders' excellent class abilities, aggressive combat and engaging loot systems allow it to stand toe to toe with some of the genre's greats.","Outriders is a game that isn't defined by big new ideas, but rather a variety of familiar elements mixed together in experimental ways. It's a role-playing game with loot-shooter elements; it's a serious, dark sci-fi outing that often comes with a pretty big dose of humor; it's a third-person cover shooter that demands you rush out and smash enemies with your ludicrously lethal magic powers. Whether this mixture works for you will determine how much you'll enjoy exploring the war-torn planet of Enoch and the last desperate vestige of humanity clinging to life there.",,,,,,,,,,,,"We didn’t exactly see anything new in Outriders, to be honest. The game delivers a fair amount of content in terms of levels, weapons, or skills. However, from the gameplay point of view, it’s nothing more than meeting aliens, zombies and insurgents in paintball arenas for 15 straight hours, plus the expeditions.",,,,,,"Despite my complaints, Outriders makes for a solid, if slightly underwhelming, experience. Several elements left me scratching my head, and there are some bizarre glitches. But going god-mode with your abilities is good fun, even if battles can feel repetitive. Your enjoyment of the game will stretch further if you have a buddy or two to bring along with you for the (out)ride. People Can Fly threw a lot at the wall, and some of it definitely stuck. With DLC and updates surely to come, the Outriders crew will hopefully hone its focus on the parts that work. There is a solid core already, but I hope Square Enix and People Can Fly will take steps to freshen up the gameplay and story so the momentum doesn’t die out the way humans did back on Earth so long ago.","In two highly competitive genres, this crossbreed may go unnoticed, but its difficulty system should be taken into account. It’s advisable to embark on the campaign of this shooting RPG since Outriders offers tons of hours of fun, invites players to play with friends, and has appealing visuals. Fans of both RPGs and shooters can get a lot out of it, but they shouldn’t expect a revolutionary game, for it is a mixed bag of interesting features and cliches. Even though the journey is enjoyable, Outriders is neither a strong contender in the RPG elite nor in the shooting universe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"You will struggle to find another third-person shooter that has innovated as much on the formula as Outriders, not since Gears of War took the genre to new heights.

It’s so committed to recreating a micro-version of Village and following it beat-for-beat that it even copies its major flaws. It concludes in the same location with the same info-dump of lore that quickly wraps up all the loose threads. It ends with the same boss fight (somehow even clunkier and more frustrating this time), and unbelievably, also ends with the exact same cutscene. The scene where Rose visits her father’s grave at the end of Village isn’t the start of Shadows of Rose - it’s the end of it. There’s no new context that makes this scene more meaningful, and in fact, that weird line where the driver calls her Eveline is an even more bizarre thing to say after these events.

SaGa games have always tried to be innovative, often times feeling like they’re prioritizing experimentation over making an enjoyable game, and Minstrel Song is one of them. The battle system is one of the more interesting features with the different elements such as durability points for weapons and life points for characters making many of the most basic battles feel like they’re a high-stakes encounter. The lack of structure in completing the main quest and side quests is a double-edged sword. It’s nice to have the freedom to explore Mardias and address quests in whatever manner the player feels, but the low emphasis on story and a rather bland world didn’t offer much encouragement to do so.

If you’re the type of person who enjoys interactive dramas, like the recent As Dusk Falls or Gone Home, you’ll likely find yourself engrossed in the narrative that unfolds here. It’s interesting, cleverly told and very intelligent – and, if nothing else, it’ll likely encourage you to learn more about the Cold War and the Antarctic Treaty. Any game that inspires us to educate ourselves more about the world around us is a win in our book.","South of the Circle presents an evocative narrative that will have you thinking about it long after you finish it.

State of Play created an interesting story, something that does pull the player through to the end. Despite the graphical hiccups, it would have been an easy recommendation. How the actual interactive elements shakes out at the end, though, drop kicks the experience in the teeth.

Highly recommended.",,,,,"Fobia St. Dinfna Hotel does a lot of things right but it falls just a tad short of matching the greatness of many other games in the genre. I loved exploring the Hotel and solving puzzles that are reminiscent of classic titles like Silent Hill and Resident Evil. It's just a shame that combat is not only boring but lacks any real challenge, and the story doesn't provide much resolution or explanation to what's really going on.",,,,,,,,,"Fobia – St. Dinfna Hotel provides some pretty solid chills. It’s not the sort of game that will wow you unless you’re already a fan of survival horror, but if you are a fan, it serves as a pretty solid reminder of the good things the genre has to offer.",,,,,"There’s not much else I can say about St. Dinfna Hotel. If you’ve played horror games then you know what you’ll be getting from this one. If you haven’t played many horror games in the past then the clumsiness of the combat, and the lack of assistance through the puzzles, makes this a poor entry point to the genre. Indeed, if you’re not familiar with the classic horror titles St. Dinfna is in homage to, the entire experience is almost pointless. I do think the developers have talent and passion for the genre, and I hope that this is successful so they can get a second run at it. If they do, all they need is to have their own voice and the confidence to add to the genre, rather than parrot it, and I do think they have it within them to create something special.",,,,,,,"Fobia – St. Dinfna Hotel is worth playing for patient survival horror fans who want something lighter on combat, and can handle budget-constrained rough edges.

Its voice acting isn’t great, which ruins the tension at times, as do its poor enemy animations and sub-par combat. But in an age where new, half-decent survival horror games are few and far between, this isn’t worth writing off completely. Its puzzles are enjoyable, and it does a good job of creating an eerie atmosphere.

Despite some technical and story-tightening issues, it can be considered one of the best horror games I've ever played.",,,,,"There's a lot of potential in Fobia: St. Dinfna Hotel, and it has some moments of excellence. Unfortunately, the lackluster visuals, weirdly unfriendly UI, and general awkwardness drag it down. It's a fine game to play if you want to scratch the survival-horror itch and you've already gone through a lot of other titles, but it doesn't do enough to distinguish itself. I'd be deeply interested to see a more polished and refined sequel because the potential doesn't shine through as well as it should.",,,,,,,"Fobia - St Dinfna Hotel is a great survival horror game, that delivers a mysterious story, fun puzzles and an atmosphere that keeps the player's attention.

It’s bare bones because there’s not a lot to the Breakers games. They’re mostly fine-fighting games with some balance issues, which stood out on the Neo Geo in the 90s but struggle to do so in 2023 on modern platforms. The new content helps but isn’t enough to make a collection that is barely a collection appealing. I’m glad to see them get a home release because I’m for keeping all games accessible, but they’re not titles I expect to return to regularly, and I expect most fighting game fans will feel the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m glad I finished it, but it’s not an easy one to recommend.",,,,,,,,"Salt And Sacrifice is every bit the sequel I could have wanted for Salt And Sanctuary. Everything about the gameplay has been elevated a polished better than any previous title from Ska Studios. With excellent combat, and a flexible progression system that lets you alter your build and playstyle how you like, mixed with amazing art, creature design, and atmosphere, this is the latest must-buy indie title.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Salt and Sacrifice is a good game that takes some ideas from FromSoftware games, as well as other popular projects, but does it very neatly, while offering an interesting visual design.",,,,,"Salt and Sacrifice to Salt and Sanctuary is like Dark Souls 2 to Dark Souls 1. It diverges a lot from the original, with some ideas that work well and some that don't. All in all, it's still an excellent 2-D Souls-like Metroidvania that brilliantly infuses Monster Hunter elements with challenging combat. Despite some poor design choices and questionable difficulty spikes, it's still astonishing to think this game was created by a team of just two people.",,,,,,,,,"Salt and Sacrifice is a game that can be frustrating for those who are not used to it, but it manages to be very fun, addictive and with a considerably high replay factor, thanks to New Game Plus. In the end, it is worth the investment for fans and for those looking for a 2D action RPG with a good duration.",,,,"Despite my minor complaints, Salt and Sacrifice is an insanely fun Souls-like featuring brutal challenges, great level designs, beautiful hand drawn graphics, interesting enemies and boss fights, cool gear to find and upgrade, a fun leveling system, and one of the most enjoyable co-op experiences I’ve had in quite a while. The fact that this game was designed by so few people and is of such high quality for a relatively low MSRP of $19.99 is nothing short of astounding. While not perfect, Salt and Sacrifice kept me entertained for well over 20 hours and made me excited for the next entry in this incredible series.",,,,,,,"After thoroughly enjoying the greatness that is Salt and Sanctuary, Salt and Sacrifice is a somewhat disappointing experience. It's still a good game, though, and one that you'll be compelled to play until it starts to overstay its welcome about 10 hours in.",,,,,,,,"It's a shame, because so much of what's here is still so enjoyable. The combat is intense, challenging and varied, with a huge number of enemy types to battle against. You've got a ton of weapon options to tailor your build, and the capacity to level up seemingly hundreds of different stats in order to bring the fight to the Mages. It's just that those fights can be so unfair and one-sided due to the more random elements that can throw a spanner in the works. A brave attempt at something new, yes, but ultimately misguided.",,"Grand ambitions can sometimes remain unfulfilled and leave a bitter taste in your mouth.

Nearly every element will be immediately familiar to those who’ve played its predecessor, with gameplay that sees all the common action RPG staples carried out admirably. However, it’s in its one novel concept, mage hunts, that it misses the mark a bit, as these add some frustrating pieces to the puzzle without really bringing anything worthwhile and unique to the formula. While it may clock in a bit below its predecessor in terms of overall package, main gameplay staples like combat and exploration continue to be of enjoyably high quality, and make this series’ second outing a worthwhile entry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, the developers have done a good job of offering ways to ease players into its eccentricities, but at the end of the day, it’s still a game where a fashionisto who can zip and unzip any flat surface might find themselves facing off against a woman with prehensile hair. There are fifty playable characters here, and even though I completed most of the All-Star mode and collected a huge amount of unlockable content, I’ve just dipped my toes into what the game has to offer.

Instead, I was surprised to find that more thought than I expected was put into its depiction of Latinx people. Although it isn’t perfect — those cringeworthy lines! The grind of finding gear! — it’s better than what I initially expected, and that counts for something.","This Far Cry is the best since the third opus - generous, fun to play, with beautiful writing and novelties, including the handcrafted weapons and the Supremos that make the gameplay extremely enjoyable. The atmosphere is perfect for an exotic journey that offers mystery, a good dose of madness and action. Plus with top notch casting. True pure Far Cry as we like it.","The 6th installment in the Far Cry series has nothing very new to say, as it continues to build on a successful formula that keeps the fans happy and willing to come back for more. Exciting gunplay, just enough content spread across a huge map and a standard Far Cry core gameplay seem enough to overtake most of the shortcomings and keep the fans busy for yet another year.","Far Cry 6 is exactly what you'd expect from a Far Cry game. It's big, open and full of things to do but there's a lot of fun to be had and some excellent combat to enjoy.","The story can be a bit confusing, as is the structure of how it's played out, but this doesn't detract from the fact that this is probably the most fun I've had with a Ubisoft game and a Far Cry game in particular.","Far Cry 6 tries to be something new but falls short on all ideas. The Supremo backpack and the design of Yara are on point, but you will be playing the same game you’ve been playing for years now when you scratch beneath the skin of this one. If you love the Far Cry series, you will love 6, but don’t expect anything new or revolutionary during your gameplay.","Reflecting on the nature of revolutionary uprising he comes to the conclusion that everything is ultimately ok as long as you die smiling. Similarly, if that’s all you really want from an open world shooter then Far Cry 6 will not disappoint.",,"Familiar, entertaining and with a cast of wacky characters, Far Cry 6 is a lot of fun. It is not novel, new or groundbreaking in any way but we are here to play Far Cry after all, and Far Cry 6 is certainly that. With lots to do and discover, Yara is a great playground to cause destruction and carnage. The customization is much improved from previous games as is the crafting, and if you liked Far Cry before, then this should be right up your street.","Far Cry 6 makes some meaningful narrative improvements, helped by a fantastic performance by Esposito. However, repetitive and familiar gameplay, combined with a restrictive progression system, means changes are needed in the future if Ubisoft wants the series to continue.",,,"How do you stop a cruel South American dictator who cares nothing for his people and only craves to become even richer and more powerful? With some good will, inventiveness and perseverance, if Far Cry 6 is to be believed. And with the help of a crazy rooster. ¡Viva la revolución!","As fun as it is, the gameplay core is the same, but introduces adjustments and a new progression system. Great world and nice use of the jet packs. However, the AI still lacks of consistency.",,,,,,"Far Cry 6 strikes me as the apex of the series, mechanically, structurally, and narratively. Far Cry has gone through its fair share of growing pains since Far Cry 3 became the de facto standard. Yet all roads, rocky or otherwise, have led to this point. Crazed villains, bombastic mayhem, and open freedom have been polished to their highest sheen. What’s presented is a dramatic piece of open world escapism, rife with possibility. Players can become decorated contract killers, loosing the bonds of an oppressive regime with any amount of chaotic bloodshed, engage in aimless side quests, or paint the world red with friends. The massive scope of Yara provides a playground of opportunity for engagement, transforming Far Cry 6 into the best yet, a date with destruction.","Far Cry 6 is a game that understands the importance of fighting back against fascism and taking a stand as part of your own personal revolution, yet it’s often held back by gameplay that wants to distance itself from that idea as you fawn over cute puppies and fire off outlandish grenade launchers. Yet it’s still a start, and a bold step forward for a company that has long sat on the fence of political discussion. If you’re after more Far Cry, this delivers and pushes the formula forward into exciting new territory.","Marks a new era for the Far Cry series and delivers more explosive action and adventure than ever before, even as the story fumbles some of its more upsetting plot points.",,,,"If you’re interested in another Far Cry game that does the Far Cry stuff the way it’s been doing it for 10 years, you’ll probably have a good time, but if you’ve already hit your limit with this kind of game, Far Cry 6 is the ne plus ultra of why open-world game design is so badly in need of a revolution.",,,,"If Far Cry 3 was the last game you really got into, or the modern Far Cry formula is your meaty open-world experience of choice that somehow never loses its potency, you’ll find a lot of comfort in Far Cry 6.

For those who love Far Cry, it’s yet another game to blast through and add to the pile, but compared to the competition, this series is starting to fall seriously behind.","Far Cry 6 is an attempt to use all the best gameplay ideas Ubisoft ever had.

But lean into the mayhem and you’ll have a good enough time, even if you don’t remember much about it once you’ve turned the game off.",,,"Far Cry 6 is a massive game, with plenty to do and see. It features a gripping story and combat that plays like a dream. I had so much fun doing everything I possibly could, and I'll be diving back in to finish off all the side content.",,"Far Cry 6 is a good addition to the beloved shooter franchise thanks to great gunplay and stunning visuals. It's a shame however that there are some really annoying bugs, crashes, and quality of life issues that take you out of the experience. The story is so much fun when Esposito's on-screen, which is, unfortunately, not enough.","The island of Yara, where Far Cry 6 takes place, feels truly alive. We enjoyed ""making the revolution"" and fighting one of the best villains in the saga, Anton Castillo. But what we like the most about this ""sandbox"" is that you could simply go for a walk through Esperanza streets, the jungle or the beaches and find incredibly fun situations.","At its core, Far Cry 6 both shines and suffers from many of the same strengths and weaknesses that have characterized the last few entries in the franchise. On one hand, it has incredibly engaging action and an open world begging to be used creatively. On the other, it has repetitive and sometimes rote mission design, with disconcerting tonal shifts that seat inconceivable brutality and violence at the same table with silly, absurd humor that feels at best disrespectful, and at worst, wildly inappropriate. What finally elevates Far Cry 6 is a better-than-average cast, and a more comprehensible and grounded story that is set in one of the most lavish and beautiful environments ever created for a game. It’s fascinating, flawed, and full of contradictions. It’s a Far Cry game.",,"Arguably the best Far Cry to date, Far Cry 6 maximizes PS5 capability while delivering a terrific experience. New and old Far Cry players shouldn't miss this one.",,,,"Whoever fell in love with Far Cry 5 (and especially New Dawn) will fall in love with Far Cry 6.

If, on the other hand, you’d like a little more in the way of innovative play and nuanced commentary, best keep hunting.",,"Far Cry 6 is a good opus in the series, but it doesn't bring anything new to the IP besides a good performance from Giancarlo Esposito.","If this isn’t your first foray into the series, then Far Cry 6 may leave you feeling a little exhausted. But if you’ve never played a Far Cry game before, you are in for the ride of your life.","Once more, Ubisoft delivers more of the same in a new setting. It’s worth playing, thanks to the enjoyable firefights Far Cry is known for. Also the new tyrant played by Giancarlo Espansito makes a good impression in a diverse and nice new environment called Yara. The sixth installment of the series has some problems, however; dumb enemy AI, the absence of a skilltree and a general lack of polish being the most annoying ones.",,"Far Cry 6 is the best version of Ubisoft's open world formula to date, but whether that's still a selling point to you is up for debate. The few advancements and new mechanics won't be enough to convince those burnt out to return for one more exotic trip, but if you're down for another lengthy checklist to complete, then the series has never been better. It's another healthy serving of comfort food; one that sticks to what it knows best while slightly iterating positively.",,A truly huge game that adds more and more content without really fundamentally changing anything.

Solid Far Cry, no doubt.","As it happens, though I played for much longer, I had had more than my fill after the first four hours, with no desire to venture back in. Strange to tell, I mourn the very things—the scalable vantages, the unlockable skills—that Ubisoft has left behind for the sake of freshness.",,"While it may not wholly evolve the franchise in a radically new way, Far Cry 6 smooths out many of the wrinkles and growing pains previous Far Cry games have had, while building on a foundation that’s largely worked for the series since 2012’s Far Cry 3. Far Cry 6 strikes a great tonal balance, a variety of activities and exploration that never get dull, another imposing villain whose presence can be felt throughout, and a brilliant main character. Yara is a fun playground because it’s Dani’s playground, and that’s a crucial part of the equation, part of the meaningful growth the latest entry brings to the Far Cry franchise. ¡Viva la Revolución!","Far Cry 6 feels like the franchise is begging for its ""Assassin's Creed Origins"" moment, where its underlying core systems are tweaked and overhauled. It still offers plenty of fun and carnage, but the formula has begun to wear thin…After three mainline entries with almost exactly the same structure, along with numerous spinoffs and expansions that hit the same notes, it’s definitely time for the series to either take an extended break or move on in a new direction.",,,,"We will be honest with you : by launching Far Cry 6, we came with a negative opinion. It's true that since the Primal episode, the series has declined over the years, with a New Dawn spin-off completely missing its pumps. But it seems that Omar Bouali and his team at Ubisoft Toronto did not want to be responsible for the downfall of the saga. Result : Far Cry 6 surprises and amazes on many aspects; starting with its story, much more interesting than any that we have lived since the beginning of the series.",,"The best entry in the series so far, cursed with uneven storytelling and rare yet unmissable technical issues. Despite these flaws, Yara is well worth a visit. [Issue#7, p.70]","Far Cry 6 is the most complete game of the entire franchise. It is almost unfathomable, with an overwhelming amount of content. And yet, the formula feels stale when it urges the reiteration of objectives and visits to enemy camps. [Recommended]","I wouldn't call Far Cry 6 ""good,"" exactly, but it has its moments of silly entertainment. Next time Ubisoft should either pick a lane or remake Far Cry 2.","If you were looking for a sequel that would shake up the series and bring about a gameplay revolution, you're going to be disappointed, but if you enjoy that classic Far Cry collect-em-up grind and simply want a brand new sandbox to explore and explode, you're going to be far from bored with all that Yara has to offer.",,,,"Far Cry as a whole is frozen in time. The few mechanical additions in the series’ latest entry don’t show much improvement over what Far Cry 5 or Far Cry New Dawn have already explored. And if your interest lies in the search for any semblance of proper representation, you’re better off looking elsewhere. Very few examples, in recent years, have been able to shake the norm. And if Far Cry 6 is any indication of what AAA publishers can do with a Latin American setting — painting it more as window dressing than an actual picture worth celebrating — I would rather not see another one try.","The world is fun to explore, filled with a batch of great side activities, and never once compromises the story’s pacing. The gameplay is smooth and responsive, though the AI needs fine-tuning to be more consistent. It’s all wrapped up in a beautiful presentation that truly transports players to paradise, at least when nothing terrible is happening. That’s not to say the game doesn’t have its quirks and questionable decisions, and many of its core gameplay loops contradict themselves when a setpiece moment shows up, but there’s still a lot of good to be found here. Yara may be an awful place to live, but playing Far Cry 6 is well worth the trip to the rotten paradise.",,,,"Far Cry 6 feels like a sequel that was made because there needed to be a sequel, that's making changes because it needs to show progress. The previous three numbered games in the series felt like they had their own identity and tried to offer more and more options to the player, but Far Cry 6 is a lateral move towards something that isn't quite the Far Cry I originally loved.","Far Cry 6 brings us back to the playground as you're encouraged to enjoy this game however you want. Those here for the story will witness some brilliant performances from the cast that weaves in the guerrilla approach to combat and overthrowing a dictator. On the other hand, this is one of the most diverse in-game environments that I have seen from the developer, with plenty of high action and optional means of losing yourself in this intense experience.",,,,"Ubisoft's signature franchises continue to deliver on what the fans have come to expect and Far Cry 6 is no exception. A sprawling sandbox with tons to do and perfect escapism for a few hours… a few tens of hours. Fans of the series or Ubisoft's style, in general, will want to pick this one up, those who haven't ever clicked with them will find nothing new here to change their mind, with only a few changes that just do not push the boat out or move away from the formulaic. Most exciting though, is the upcoming DLC: a season pass that promises to give players a whole different experience. Stepping into the shoes of the villains of the previous games, starting with Vaas. Stay with us here at Cubed3, where we'll be covering it soon.","Far Cry 6 introduces some interesting new elements, with a talking protagonist and some solid supporting characters, but unfortunately the villain nicely portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito appears too stereotyped to stand out and the structure with its regions and lieutenants turns out to be too traditional. Gameplay-wise the game is a mixed bag, with some good things but also several missed opportunities.","Vast and long-lived, Far Cry 6 is an open world where quantity is king: there are lots of playful ideas, and lots of customization possibilities, but often one gets the impression that Ubisoft tries at all costs to never end the battle of the guerrillas, even sacrificing the refinement of the game mechanics on the altar of accumulation. Far Cry 6 is therefore a fluctuating production: moments of high narrative involvement are accompanied by others of stasis, while the gameplay oscillates between good ideas and some uncertainty in the shooting phases and in artificial intelligence.

New features, such as the Supremo and various ammo types, do a great job of spicing up a familiar formula. At the same time, the series' rock-solid gunplay and exciting exploration are more inviting than ever. Even though it sometimes stumbles, both in terms of performance and tone, traversing the island nation of Yara is so fun that you probably won’t care all that much…Whether smashing the system solo or teaming up with a fellow freedom fighter for some online co-op, Far Cry 6 is sure to give armchair guerillas something worth fighting for.

There were brief stretches of time I began to sink more willingly into its simple brand of mindless monotony. But there are just too few examples of the game’s mechanics coalescing to deliver memorable, crazy, unpredictable action. With so little dynamism in the world’s AI and its systems, missions aren’t just identically structured, they’re fundamentally limited in potential outcomes. And in a world this enormous, with characters that are this intent on destroying the status quo, it ends up feeling like wasted space. If only overthrowing an evil tyrant was as simple as amassing a hundred collectibles. Viva la repetición.",,"Even within the meandering and aimless boundaries of the open world big-budget shooter genre—games designed to lovingly transform vast hours of human existence into points map percentage completion, without involving the brain in all but the most cursory of ways—Far Cry 6 stands as a disappointment. As a political statement, it’s cruel, bleak, and simplistic. As a game, it’s rote, repetitive, and only surface-level innovative. As a hybrid of the two, it’s an outright disaster.",,"The new episode of the Far Cry series really tries a lot to find new ways how to enjoy the game, and at the same time it relies on the unattainable depth that the charismatic Giancarlo Esposito was supposed to give to the game. Instead, players again receive a disparate mishmash that is increasingly moving away from both the original Far Cry idea and the Just Cause sandbox.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Far Cry 6 is the most fun I've had in a Far Cry game for years, but it won't be for everyone.

However, if the thrill of carnage and combat still appeals, it's crazy, chaotic, and an absolute blast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temtem,,,,,"With its online implementation and improved strategic combat, there are certainly appealing qualities to Temtem, but its entrenched ties to old-school Pokemon prevent it from blossoming into something greater.

The balance can be a bit troublesome, but that may vary from person to person. However, it offers enough differences to be unique, with its default two-on-two battles and mechanics adding variety to each fight. Plus, playing with friends is easy and a blast.",,,,"Temtem’s disappointing, because it promised to be so much. In a genre that has been so utterly dominated by one particular property, and then lightyears back to the nearest rival, here was a game that seemed like it had the ambition and scope to actually rival Game Freak’s giant on its home turf. Unfortunately the result is more akin to the more egregious MMOs – a waste of time that exists to be a waste of time.",,,,"A good Pokémon 'copy' that manages to pull off its own personality through the battle system but that, at the same time, carries an obvious problem: it really tries to be an MMORPG, yet in the end it stays as an open world with 'ghost' characters.

Its blend of MMO mechanics gives it the potential for a long-running, sustainable community with more to enjoy than a single-player narrative. The new combat mechanics are a fantastic upgrade. However, the Tems themselves and the overall lack of guidance aren’t quite up to standards. Tems aren’t that memorable themselves and many of their names just don’t click. Having no guidance on typing, advantages, or explanations on a number of smaller features drops the enjoyment of gameplay. It’s a great experience, but it expects you to already have a certain amount of knowledge of both genres before picking up the controller.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"By and large, Temtem is a well-made, generous monster-taming RPG that differentiates itself enough from the obvious competition. The battle system is perhaps its main strength, offering quite challenging 2-on-2 fights even against wild encounters. It's jam-packed with stuff to do, and its online integration means connecting with other players is easy. The creature designs could be better, and the writing and human characters aren't particularly memorable, but if the game clicks for you, those weaknesses will fade into the background.",,,,"Temtem still isn’t finished, which is why there’s no score here, but Crema are making good on their promise of constant improvements and additions; so when it does come out of early access next year The Pokémon Company is going to have their most serious rival for a very long time.

marvels-avengers,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Though Marvel's Avengers makes a superhero-sized splash on PlayStation 5, this is still at its core the same game we had back in September 2020. That said, the improved visuals and passage of time both mean that Marvel's Avengers on PS5 is essentially now the definitive version of the game, boasting much more responsive gameplay and a wealth of bug fixes and quality of life improvements. Though no amount of extra pixels or DualSense features can transform the game, the fact that Marvel's Avengers is actually enjoying a fairly steady stream of worthwhile content should be reassuring to those who have been sat on the fence for the superpowered caper. In short, if you've been sitting Marvel's Avengers out, now is the time to jump in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The technical prowess of Marvel's Avengers on PS5 is impressive; the game has never looked better and the endless load times are a thing of the past. The new content that launched alongside the current-gen update is nothing to write home about, however, and there isn't much here for players who finished the base game at launch. The upcoming Black Panther campaign and new DLC content might fix that, but Hawkeye isn't enough on his own. The PS5 version of Marvel's Avengers is the definitive version of the game for players who held off at launch, as the frustrating technical issues are gone, but the game hasn't quite received the content overhaul that it needs to win back the crowd that's already experienced it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While the content shortage and cross-play challenges still exist, performance problems are eliminated, and bugs almost entirely eradicated by the next-gen console launch of The Avengers.

Count us in every single time.,,"Evil West is a nostalgic throwback to the 7th generation of consoles where the story was corny, the environments were bland, the protagonists were manly men, and everything was cheezy and glorious – and I like this very, very much. The fun combat is only hindered but a plethora of bugs and a pretty linear level design.",,,"Sometimes you want to start a game and have fun right from the get-go. Evil West doesn't try to do anything fancy or tell a big cinematic story. Instead, it gives you various tools to go in, and slaughter vampires like humanity's existence depend on it. With plenty of weapons and fun combat, Evil West provides plenty of non-stop action, although it's let down by a paper-thin story and some issues with visuals and lighting.",,,,,,,,"Evil West feels like an Xbox 360 or PS3 game in the best possible way. Great action, tight controls, interesting story and more, makes this game the best surprise of 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"You should give Evil West a chance, just don't expect it to be a similar to other modern shooters that came out this year. What you should expect is a very dynamic gameplay that won't leave you bored even for one minute.",,,,"With the combat being the heart and soul of Evil West, it’s a relief that it’s so engaging and enjoyable throughout. It’s just a shame that a better balance hasn’t been struck between performance and visuals, as neither mode is particularly ideal. It’s still very much worth digging into Evil West, however: if you can look past the blurry visuals at 1080p, there’s a lot of fun to be had in this old-fashioned action-adventure – and you can even bring a friend along for the ride.","Evil West in fun in the moment, but largely forgettable due to the poor writing and level design. While the combat is stellar and intuitive when in the heat of battle, the glue holding those battles together could use some love. With a boring protagonist and stilted dialogue, Evil West feels more low budget than it likely really is. Luckily, there is a solid core here to build upon for the inevitable sequel, and punching dudes with electricity never gets old.",,"Evil West is one of the most surprising and enjoyable action games of the year, and Flying Wild Hog have an absolute banger on their hands.",,,,,,,"Despite technical issues, Evil West manages to be fun for its exaggerated gameplay and the large amount of combat options. However, don't expect much more than that.",,,,"Evil West doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it doesn't have to. It's fun and a great time, which is all it needs to be.

There is enough amusement and it's refreshingly free from finery and unnecessary gameplay mechanics.",,"Evil West is a relic of a bygone era, one that any fan of high-octane action games should experience. An all-round excellently paced main campaign, ridiculously fun combat, and flexible character progression make for one of 2022's best games, and one of the best third-person shooters in recent years.",,,,,,,,,"This game dishes out an interesting mythology that is complemented by a deep combat system, so it never gets bored easily. The colorful levels and high fun content then finish it off.

That said, Evil West is a more than excellent game in its own right.",,"Evil West is one of those really enjoyable 7/10s. It's never going to win any awards and it's probably not going to stick long in the memory, but give it a few years and someone, somewhere, will swear to you that it's actually an underappreciated classic. It's a chunky action game that knows how to have fun, both in and out of combat.",,"A game from the generation before the last somehow found its way to us in the year 2022. The combat is great, the story is fun, the graphics are… dated. Perhaps you can stomach it for the few hours it takes to beat the game.",,"An enjoyable combat system is left to flounder in an otherwise unambitious ode to Xbox 360 era shooters, that quickly gets too repetitive to enjoy.",,,,"Evil West is a fun, frenetic, blood-soaked, testosterone-fueled action game with a lot to like. There’s some old-school charm to it, but at the same time some old-school frustrations. When co-op works, it’s fun, though it is by no means required to enjoy the game on its own merits. When you’re through the holiday’s festivities, and you want something to play that’s a bit mindless while also being entertaining, then Evil West should be on your list of games to play.",,,,,"Old school but enjoyable, Evil West offers us a scenario of cowboys and vampires, a very naughty gameplay, and a general design inherited from the games of 2010. A formula that quickly finds its limits in certain aspects of the game, but its combos devastating will satisfy you.",,"The lean and mean design may be limiting but it feels great when you’re chuntering through masses of monsters. Destined to be a modern cult classic. [Issue#22, p.88]",,,,,"For me, Evil West is the kind of game I miss these days. I’ll fully admit, I love games like Destiny and Fortnite, games that never end and are filled with battle passes, crafting, loot, etc. Those games can provide hours of fun and are great to play while chilling with friends or listening to a podcast. But I don’t want everything to be a complex, all-encompassing, time-monopolizing social experience that continues to grow and evolve as time goes on. And Evil West is a wonderful example of the kind of games I want more of moving forward. Not everything needs an endgame or a crafting table. Sometimes, I just want to move forward, hear some bad banter and punch some monsters in the face for a few hours. And Evil West gave me exactly that. No more. No less.",,,,,,,,"Flying Wild Hog absolutely nailed it with a damn fun old-fashioned shooter beat’em up that embraces its linear-level design and fluid combat. Sure it doesn’t have that AAA polish and budget, nor is it reinventing the wheel, but it does a fantastic job showing the world that even nostalgic games can be appreciated through a modern lens.",,,Evil West’s outstanding combat and flashy graphics make it a worthwhile experience that burns fast but bright.,,"Evil West features plenty of spectacular, frantic, fun and challenging fights, in which we will be able to exploit a very wide repertoire of moves and weapons to kill hordes of monsters, vampires, werewolves and undeads in the most painful way possible. Unfortunately, everything else is disappointing.",,,"Evil West has a lot of things going for it—the designs are fascinating, the lore excellent, and the gameplay can be massively fun on hard. But it also has some downfalls—the levels feel just a bit too linear, and the main narrative takes a while to really jump into, and even then, it struggles with fluid cut scenes and complexity. While other games have been able to get away with a basic narrative because of their fantastic action, Evil West isn’t quite there.",,,,,,,,,,,"The writing is dreadful and much of the game feels like it could have been released 17 years ago. But if you look past some of its shortcomings, there is a decent action game hidden underneath. We just wished the game would have made a little more out of its premise (which is still pretty rad).",,,,"Despite these issues, Evil West will most certainly become a better experience with some fine-tuning and a patch or two. As far as I am concerned, its core formula is an entertaining one, bringing players on a linear ride into the wild west and unleashing the darkness of vampires for good measure. For those seeking a pleasant time of vanquishing evil for 10-15 hours using your fists and guns without the stress of needing to do too much, Evil West should firmly be in your sights as your next call of adventure.","Evil West isn't a hugely complex game but it's fun enough to recapture both the nostalgia and fun of the early '00s. Though its story and performance can dip, its gameplay doesn't.","Evil West’s gameplay focuses around progression. It loves to introduce new elements like weapons, combat and enemies and then proceed to absolutely smash the player with an assortment of everything they have learnt by the end of each chapter. The constant change in how you play the game is overall satisfying, but its rinse and repeat formula of enemies and mini bosses became annoying the more time I spent with it. The location art and narrative is exciting, but I longed to be given more opportunities to explore and be rewarded for my endeavours based on the enticing nature of each area. Evil West is an exciting ride that will test your reflexes and ability to take on swarms of monsters which will either leave you feeling exhilarated, frustrated or like me, somewhere in between.",,"Even the nice setting with vampires in the Wild West can hardly save anything: The hectic gameplay with annoying opponent spam, which no combat system can cope with, is unimaginative and lacks a real spark of charm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Evil West is the kind of beautiful trash I wish we had more of. It’s a ridiculous game in service to a purpose no higher than smashing monsters to gloopy bits, and by God do I admire that. While at times combat balance is uneven, any such moment is made up for by a terrific weapon set, extravagant finishers, and an immediacy of offense that ensures the action never wavers. Refined? No. Elegant? Hardly. Fun as f.ck? F.cking yes.","Despite a few rough edges in terms of stage design and enemy variety, Evil West is a must-own experience for fans of the character action game genre. With a deep and engaging combat system, a meaty campaign, and a killer sense of style, it’ll leave you glued to your controller until the credits roll. If you’re a fan of Flying Wild Hogs’ brand of gory, in-your-face action, Evil West is a non-stop thrill ride through the freaky frontier that you won’t want to miss.",,,,,,,,,,,,There's fun to be had in Evil West but there are far too many chinks in this armor to make it worthy of wearing into the field. ,,,,,,,,,,,,"With a flow of combat that rivals that of the Doom Slayer, Evil West hits its mark when taking on vampires, werewolves, and everything in between, despite finding the rest of the experience a bit lacking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While I don’t think Evil West will be anyone’s game of the year, it’s rare to get such a pure action game these days.

It faces a tough battle in an oversaturated modern market where online is concerned, but as a local multiplayer title, it could easily maintain a healthy shelf life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Whether Gigabash proves enduringly sticky enough to weather the wax and wane of the console’s fighting game community seems up to chance, and its prickly price tag isn’t doing it any favors. It’s not a Smash Bros. killer but has its own eccentricities and charm, even while begging for that franchise’s array of match-changing items or epic single-player modes; just a tournament mode or randomized match queue would be welcome. As it stands, it’s still a smooth and quirky kaiju brawler packed with cities and buildings to crush to dust.",,,,,,"There is a lot about GigaBash that speaks to me as a lifelong kaiju fan. The visuals, the Titan designs, the pick-up-and-play ease of the controls, the level variety, the lore, it’s all top-notch and easy to gush about. If you can consistently get three other people to join you locally in the action, you’re going to get a lot out of this game. If that’s not realistic for you, know that it can still be a pretty fun time even if you’re not getting the optimal experience.",,,,,,"GigaBash doesn’t try to do anything particularly new, but it doesn’t really matter. It’s a game that’s easy to pick up, resulting in an accessible brawler that’s not only pleasing on the eyes, but also a riot to play. Mastering each monster on offer is a joy that’s only rivalled by picking other players up and throwing them across the screen, or gathering enough energy so you can grow to epic proportions for a short while. Needless to say, if the idea of battling friends and family while levelling cities appeals to you, GigaBash is worth a look. Well, as long as you can stomach its price.",,,,,,,,,,"GigaBash is quite straightforward in what it proposes large-scale battles between monsters and other typical figures of the genre and offers very simple, but very satisfying systems. If, on the one hand, it offers little content to keep the single-player player engaged for a long time, it is in the shared fun (online or local) where the game reveals its great strength.",,,,,"In the end, GigaBash is a game that's loads of fun if you're playing with local friends. Even if you don't partake in the minigames, the combat is deeper than expected in a fighting game like this, so you'll spend more than a few rounds playing with others. It doesn't have much going for it if you choose to play solo or are trying to get online, but as long as you have a group ready for a get-together, GigaBash fits perfectly in a party-style rotation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Multiplayer is undoubtedly the game's main draw. Supporting up to four players, you've got free-for-all, 2v2 team battles, while Mayhem Mode – which is sadly not available online – introduces minigames, including classics like The Floor is Lava and boss fights. Our personal favourite is Rampage, which sees players racing to destroy as many buildings as possible for points, though there’s plenty of other options. This all adds some necessary variety and if you can assemble three other players, GigaBash is a great time that comes recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"GigaBash is a love letter to Kaiju cinema, assuming that a love letter can involve throwing buildings at each other.

In the end we come out with the impression of not having had an impact on the story, even worse of not having really played... Pity!",,,,"The third installment of The Dark Pictures Anthology brings a more action-packed story and a different kind of twist.

I did enjoy my time playing through another The Dark Pictures Anthology tale, but it hasn’t left an impact on me as a player as Little Hope did. Choices often felt inconsequential, and few and far between. Character development for all of the characters outside of Salim was underwhelming and disappointing, even though the backdrop of the Iraq War in 2003 was ripe for compelling character development.",,A lackluster military versus monsters soap opera that just about redeems itself with an extravagant final third and unmatched co-op mechanics.,"In flicking back through my notes on House of Ashes, I find that I have been more negative on it in this review than I remember feeling from my time playing it. It is a highly enjoyable experience and hard to put down. It might not be as spooky as I’d like from a horror game, and it might not play the way I think it should given the type of horror the developers were aiming for, but ultimately, holding the lives of a bunch of delinquent characters in my hands and deliberately letting them fall to their proverbial (or perhaps literal) deaths will never fail to be a (ghoulishly) good time.","House of Ashes is a fun horror romp. There's nothing subtle to be found here and the game is all the better for it, with exciting set pieces and a fast-paced story. It has its issues, both technically and with not really having anything interesting to build into its Iraq War setting, but it's still a hoot to play.",,,,,,"As much as I feel like this series is stuck in the shadow of Until Dawn for a large part of the audience, collectively, The Dark Pictures Anthology is becoming something memorable in its own right.

I’m looking forward to more entries in this series. If I think of The Dark Pictures Anthology by itself, I believe this series is getting better with time.",,"House of Ashes is by far the best entry into The Dark Pictures Anthology yet. Supermassive Games has outdone itself in terms of visual design, storytelling and pacing, and the result is a game that's absolutely dripping with foreboding atmosphere. The story, playing out over six thrilling hours, keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish – and with so many possible outcomes, chances are you're going to want to jump straight back in. For horror fans, this is an absolute must-play.",,"At the end of House Of Ashes’ seven or so hour run time, I felt similar to if I’d just watched a low-budget action film - something more akin to Dog Soldiers than the game’s intended influences. It was a good time but I don’t really feel like I need to play it again in order to get everything I’m going to get from it. The game ranks firmly above Man Of Medan, but below Little Hope, and I hope that the next chapter in the series leans back towards the horror aspects rather than the action.","A tense, action-packed tale that feels completely different from what you've come to expect from The Dark Pictures Anthology so far.",,"House of Ashes is the best iteration in the franchise yet. The horror feels more mature and the jumpscares are not as prominent as before. The animations are not always great and next-gen features are yet to be used fully, but suspense and scares are guaranteed.

The intriguing premise and methodical pacing help to build an overwhelming sense of trepidation, making you question what lies in the myriad of breathing shadows. Although the final third lacks the ambition and ingenuity of its early segments, it’s another great example and celebration of the horror genre.","House of Ashes will not be remembered as a horror masterpiece in video games, but it is a good excuse to gather friends or family for a different night; already almost traditional. And thanks to that, the experience earns many points.","House of Ashes, while not perfect, (or even scary truth be told) is a good installment in the series as it provides gorgeous graphics along with its interesting premise.",,,,,"The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes might not be very frightening, but it absolutely nails a tense atmosphere where every choice really does matter. With gorgeous visuals and a satisfying, well paced story, Supermassive has finally found their footing.","That basically sums up The Dark Pictures: Episode 3 - House of Ashes. It's a cheesy action-horror movie, except you can help characters survive (or die) with your button presses. It's not my favorite of the lot, but I was relatively engaged. It's an enjoyable enough B movie and feels like it would thrive the best as a multiplayer party game. If you've enjoyed the rest of the franchise so far, you'll enjoy House of Ashes because aside from some quality of life changes, it's largely in the same mold.",,,"The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is far and away the best Dark Pictures game so far. It blends intriguing characters, compelling drama, and a killer twist to offer up what can only be described as the most honed experience Supermassive has put out in this series so far. It's got a few minor issues here and there – namely relating to the diversity of its cast and how much each of them plays into the overall story – but it's a horror experience that no fan should miss even if they weren't fans of Man of Medan or Little Hope.","While not perfect, Supermassive Games hears players and House of Ashes is the best release in the Dark Pictures Anthology to date.

If you liked the other ones, you'll definitely love this.",,"After the crummy Man of Medan and the better-but-not-quite-there Little Hope, The Dark Pictures Anthology has finally started hitting its stride with House of Ashes.",,,"You can now say that The Dark Pictures Anthology offers a constant quality, where predictability is largely prevented by enough variety in setting and type of monsters. Unfortunately, the trick of five protagonists and player choices that determine the course of the story is starting to become somewhat transparent, so don't expect plot twists that will blow you off your seat.",,"House of Ashes does not distort the philosophy of Supermassive Games. While retaining the cinematic staging of The Dark Pictures saga, this third episode now offers a 360 ° camera and better integrated QTEs. Thanks to its controlled rhythm, its claustrophobic atmosphere and its interesting plot, it surpasses its predecessors despite its flaws (uneven writing, cartoonish characters, frozen shooting phases…). For anyone who enjoys interactive experiences of the genre, this latest iteration of the anthology is worthy of curiosity.","If only House of Ashes were possessed with something malevolent enough to actually scare us; sadly, it commits a litany of sins, none of them original.",,"The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is an impressive addition to the series that not only looks stunning on next gen, but also plays out in multiple player controlled scenarios, than can vary from triumphant, to downright heart breaking. It’s a dark journey through horror and blood, with only you (and maybe a friend in co-op) to determine who makes it out the other side.",,"House of Ashes is undoubtedly the best chapter in the Dark Pictures Anthology. The fascinating setting, a varied cast and the usual gameplay made up of tearing moral dilemmas and inevitable QTEs support an authentic descent into hell to discover an ancestral horror buried under the sands of the Iraqi desert.","A good sequel with high replay value for this kind of games and with some minor technical advantages for users on PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. If you like the series, you need to play it. If not, House of Ashes won't change your mind about the series.","The Dark Pictures: House of Ashes certainly changes things up for the anthology, with a cliché over the top story and a new tone that returning fans may not enjoy.

While Iraq isn’t stockpiling warheads in House of Ashes, what they’ve got are functionally WMDs: a colony of murderous vampire spawn. The vampire nest is a feel-good justification for horror movie violence, one that undermines the game’s half-hearted suggestions of war remorse.",,,,,"Supermassive is back with an enjoyable adventure that we recommend playing with friends, although we also feel the core of the experience –the story– isn’t strong enough.",,"House of Ashes adds little to the Dark Pictures formula, and doesn't seem to progress the anthology's overarching plot. That said, it's still a great adventure with some jaw dropping visuals and action-packed set pieces. A solid addition to the franchise.","The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is a fantastic feat in the adventure narrative genre. There's a focus on character drama to make the cast more dynamic and a group of flesh-eating demons to keep your heart racing. Choices have a considerable impact, but there's room to play again and again, with accessible options to fine-tune the experience and a new camera system to enhance exploration. Alone or with friends, no matter how you play, a nightmare awaits.",,,,,House of Ashes is a decent step forward for a series that also requires adjustments to hit the target. The third chapter of the Dark Pictures Anthology grows better narratively and in the writing of dialogues.,"Now in its third act, The Dark Pictures Anthology shows the first signs of a perhaps inevitable fatigue. Wisely trying to involve and amaze the player with unprecedented stylistic ideas, Supermassive Games chooses to adopt a more impactful pace, and thus creates another type of horror where violence takes precedence over restlessness. Between slight additions and repeated defects, House of Ashes is, without too many surprises, at the same qualitative level as its predecessors, with a small downward or upward decline based on the preferences of individual users, who may or may not like the cinematic sub-genre. staged by the studio. We do not yet fully know what the future of the series will hold for us, although the game - as always - provides us with some clues in the form of a premonition: what is certain is that the horror will change its aspect again.","House of Ashes gives the impression of playing the same Supermassive game with a new story. The passage to next-gen systems looks irrelevant to a series that doesn't know how to evolve its formula. It has a better story than Little Hope, but presents the same issues already seen in the other two chapters.",,,"Supermassive has an incredible talent for creating gripping narratives of a horror persuasion, and despite some technical bumps in the sand, my retrospective opinion on House of Ashes still remains the same: It’s a bloody good creature feature.",,"House of Ashes is the most ambitious episode in Supermassive Games' The Dark Pictures Anthology yet. But having a well crafted story and great characters is not enough when many elements of the game -like the new, free camera or the many technical issues- are problematic thus keeping it from achieving greatness.",,,"There's a lot to like in House of Ashes. It can look great (but also a bit ropey at points), the acting is largely excellent, and your actions (or lack of) can really impact the story. Yet, the game element is lacking, which in turn makes the gameplay sequences where you're in proper control end up lacking in scares. This is a fun time, especially if played in a group or online with a friend, but I was more afraid of button prompts than the monsters.",,The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is Supermassive's best horror game since Until Dawn made it famous.,,,"I feel torn about House of Ashes. I’ve been overly negative here, but it isn’t by any means a bad game, it just didn’t gel with me in the way that Little Hope, for example, did.",,,"At the end of the day, if you already liked The Dark Pictures games, you should really enjoy House of Ashes. Its story is unique, complex, interesting, and suspenseful without relying on cheap scares. If you didn’t like Little Hope or Man of Medan, but are still open to enjoying the series, House of Ashes is worth giving a shot.",,,,,,,"The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is the perfect game to curl up with this Halloween if you are looking for a scary game to play alone or with friends. However, there are too many stretches where you can put the controller down and forget it is a game at all. For anyone who enjoyed previous titles from Supermassive Games, House of Ashes is more of the same.","House of Ashes, the third installment of The Dark Pictures Anthology, is an entertaining game with high production values, yet it wastes its potential. It is an interactive movie that could be profound, but strives to be superficial in both its narrative and gameplay. It touches on sensitive historical issues, mainly the US invasion of Iraq. It is interesting to see how the war has shaped the personality of the protagonists, how it has affected their interpersonal relationships, and how they justify their role in the invasion. All these nuances, which could present a profound discourse on human logic in the context of war, are buried under a superficial story about a curse in ancient ruins. If someone is a fan of cinematic experiences, this is a game worth trying; It is a good game to pass the time, however it had the potential to be more memorable.","House of Ashes can be, at times, a rewarding experience; however, the developers, in order to achieve a remarkable result in graphics, have neglected too much the pace and the interaction with the player.","With House of Ashes, Supermassive Games takes a more action oriented that some may regret. It is also less horrific, but still relies on effective dilemmas to guide its story. As for the graphics, they can be beautiful as well as a bit overdone and suffer from a sometimes strange facial animation. And although it still needs to be improved, we welcome the switch to free camera, as well as the 3 difficulty levels proposed for the QTEs. Still as cinematic as ever, the title offers us an adventure around a Sumerian legend with an undeniable replayability and which is perfectly suited to multiplayer games with friends.","House of Ashes never came close to terrifying or surprising me, but I still found it a respectable thriller that should make for an entertaining night alone or with up to four friends passing the controller. If you’ve enjoyed the Anthology up to this point, you’ll likely get a kick out of this too. But if you’ve been waiting for The Dark Pictures to reach the heights of Until Dawn, don’t get your hopes up for another year.",,,,"House of Ashes marks a change of pace from previous episodes of the Dark Pictures Anthology, offering a horror story that also focuses heavily on action. The plot, which incorporates elements of films such as Aliens, Predator and The Descent, does not shine for originality, but is overall enjoyable and sufficiently articulated. There is still some occasional uncertainty in the interactions between characters, but overall the dialogues are good and the narrative crossroads are numerous and lead to endings that have significant differences between them. The new gameplay features do not change the gaming experience, but improve it slightly, while graphics/sound remains on good standards.",,,"The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is yet another excellent offering from the masters of horror at Supermassive Games. While not every facet of its choose-your-own-adventure style narrative works, its compelling cast of characters and immense replayability will keep you coming back for more.

If that’s not a testament to the game’s lasting power, then I don’t know what is.",,"House of Ashes is limited, but oh so entertaining. It's a bit sad that the focus on action overtakes some of the horror elements, but at the same time we appreciate that the story and the environments differ a lot from the anthology's previous titles.",,,,,,,An intriguing premise backed by refined gameplay and an immersive atmosphere makes House of Ashes the best entry in The Dark Pictures Anthology yet.,"Its setting and characters offer a fresh perspective for the series, while Supermassive's penchant for creating tension through something as simple as a QTE is as masterful as ever. It might not be particularly fear-inducing, but its action set-pieces are fraught with peril for the fate of its characters, and the final act sticks the landing with a satisfying payoff. The series might still be stuck in the smothering shadow of Until Dawn, but House of Ashes is a step in the right direction.",,,,,,"House of Ashes is far from perfect, and the Dark Pictures system still shows room for improvement. But both mechanically and narratively this is its best outing yet – by far – and horror fans happy with an interactive narrative will find more to love here than ever before.",,,,,,,,,,,,"All in all, House of Ashes is a solid new entry in The Dark Pictures Anthology. While I ultimately found it to be a less engaging and frightening experience than its immediate predecessor, it’s still an enjoyable adventure title with some impressive animation work on display. And while I wasn’t in love with some of the changes, I respect that Supermassive Games is listening to fan feedback and attempting to innovate with each successive title. We’re due for at least one more of these games, so I’ll be very curious to see what the Curator has in store for us next time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For those looking for a different type of game, Haven is a great alternative for those looking for a great character-driven and emotional. experience.",,,,,,,,,,,"Haven presents a lush alien world, one rife with resource gathering and loaded with turn-based combat, as a suitable venue for its forbidden love story.

Yu and Kay have their ups and downs, but Haven shows that love conquers all hardships. The game is about exploring and finding new places, and of course being free to love whoever you want. Like all relationships the game isn’t perfect, but it successfully presents a warm and powerful narrative that demonstrates an adult relationship with characters that we can all relate to.",,,,,,,,"Haven is a cute and enjoyable mix of light survival, light RPG, and serious romance novel. It's exactly the kind of game to play if you want to relax for a few hours and see adorable people being adorable. The surprisingly enjoyable RPG combat and gentle survival mechanics make the game feel more like a game, while at heart it is closer to a visual novel. If you like warm and fuzzy feelings, Haven is a great choice, as long as you don't mind the occasional risqué dialogue.","Haven may have been too ambitious for The Game Bakers.

It's still an awful lot of fun for those who enjoyed the base game, and the assassinations may be simple but do add a bit of a variety to the experience. However, there's little that's truly refreshing, and is not a must-have for those who own Assassin's Creed Valhalla.",,,,,,,,,,,,"In many ways, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: The Siege of Paris feels like the Assassin’s Creed of old. A smaller affair with a story that actually feels like it has stakes, its characters are interesting and a little more fleshed out in some cases, making the twists it sends your way more impactful. Throw in the engaging assassination missions, and you have a brilliant piece of DLC that’s not to be missed.

It gives fans an extra fifteen hours of gameplay and an excellently told story to a familiar, robust, just not-routine gameplay experience.",,"If it is a little shorter than its predecessor, this second Assassin's Creed Valhalla DLC is nevertheless more interesting. This is due in particular to the gripping atmosphere of this afflicted Francia, governed by a king who has lost his mind.

Add to that a little welcome return to basics and the qualities of the initial title, and you get a new gripping adventure for Eivor, although hampered by the absence of a seat worthy of the name and real novelties.",,,,,Quotation forthcoming.,"The Siege of Paris rounds up a great Season Pass offer for Assassin's Creed Valhalla.

Its story provides a truly memorable menace in King Charles, but otherwise doesn’t stand out much from what we’ve already seen, substituting Breton soldiers with Frankish ones. Valhalla of course remains fun on its own merits, but the base adventure already has Mjolonir’s weight in nearly identical content.",,,,,,"The difference this time around, though, is that I think The Siege of Paris does at least feel markedly different from the base game, both in ambiance and structure. Where Wrath of the Druids’ Ireland could quite easily have been another region of England in the base game, The Siege of Paris does genuinely stand apart. It’s a throwback to old Assassin’s Creed I’m sure fans of the franchise, rather than just fans of Valhalla, will love. And for that reason, in combination with the fact that it tells an interesting story, offers a great reason to reboot or reinstall the game for those who haven’t returned since completing it last year.","Beyond that, what we have is more Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. And sure, I like Valhalla, but I was basically satiated on it a while ago and the Siege of Paris has not really changed my mind on that. Momentary fun cutting through archers doesn’t really save an experience that feels a bit lacklustre, and doesn’t quite live up to the advanced hype. Lovers of the core game will find more of what they enjoy here, but those who are less invested can be safe in skipping this one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Siege of Paris delivers an adventure that I simply could not put down, keeping me riveted to the final battle and beyond, and I would return to this world in an absolute heartbeat.

A field-of-view slider and jump button would have been appreciated, and the new Castle Kandar map can’t come soon enough. Players are also right to worry about its online-only infrastructure as the game is wholly dependent on an internet connection even though it has content that should be playable offline. However, despite its few drawbacks, it’s a near-perfect tribute to Sam Raimi’s creation as the game is groovy fun whether you play as a survivor or a demon. It has a great foundation so here’s hoping Saber Interactive keeps us coming back with plenty of post-launch updates.",,,,,"Evil Dead: The Game is a good time, albeit demanding (it appears single-player missions have everyone struggling), but it truly lets itself down by not having basic accessibility settings available to players. The game itself is certainly impressive in terms of its fresh gameplay and remarkable graphics, and there’s good fun to be had for fans of Evil Dead and Sam Raimi. However, horror fans without an affinity towards the series will likely find more fun in alternative multiplayer horror games, and they’ll probably find more accessibility-friendly games, too.",,,,"Evil Dead The Game captures the essence of the franchise perfectly. It's funny, it's bloody and sometimes even a bit scary. Unfortunately the gameplay is very repetitive and doesn't motivate longer than for a few sessions in a row.",,,,"Even so, there’s just no denying the charm of Evil Dead: The Game. It’s a brilliant encapsulation of what made the movies so iconic and beloved, and it just oozes humor and delicious campiness at every turn. It’s still fairly rare for games attached to some sort of entertainment IP to do well, but I’d say Evil Dead’s already off to a groovy start.",,,,,,"Evil Dead: The Game is a horror title that surprises us by offering us two aspects, being survivors or evil incarnate. We have several characters with different abilities and we must know how to cooperate to close the gates of hell. We can play it in co-op mode or enjoy customizable local matches.",,,,,,,,,"Whether you’re playing with your friends or alone, Evil Dead: The Game will give you a short but entertaining action-survival experience. Carrying some friends along is a good idea – Ash is still one of the best characters in the horror universe but he can't do everything on his own! As always with multiplayer games, playerbase retention and developer support are going to be crucial aspects in the coming weeks and months.",,,"Evil Dead: The Game is an experience that oozes with an appreciation of the source material from every pore, whilst also providing a gameplay experience that delivers fun and frights in spades. For players looking to dig deep into character progression and team compositions, there’s an absolute wealth of content available to progress through and experiment with. Whilst the teething issues when it comes to balance cannot be ignored, even these struggle to prevent me from hopping back in given how much fun can still be had, despite the need for Saber Interactive to create a more even playing field. If you love asymmetrical multiplayer or the Evil Dead, then grab those boomsticks, you won’t be disappointed.",,,,,,,,"Evil Dead: The Game surprised me in every single way. It was more than I expected. The attention to detail in the characters, enemies, and environments. The Knowby cabin is outstanding and nearly a 1 for 1 replica. The finishers are beautiful, the environments eerie and creepy, the gameplay loop addictive, but most importantly it is fun.",,,,"Despite its jagged, toothy edges, Evil Dead: The Game remains one of the more pleasant surprises of this year so far. Gripes are pushed to the background when you possess a survivor and use them against their team or rend a Deadite to bits with a chainsaw and even with some movement hang-ups on both teams, every match plays out relatively smoothly. If Saber Interactive keeps up with community feedback and delivers more DLC down the line, Evil Dead: The Game could solidify itself as one of the truly great asymmetrical horror experiences.",,,,"Evil Dead: The Game is a must-play for Raimi-heads, but is more difficult to recommend for others. Its Survivor modes are chaotic, with a steep learning curve. Playing as the Demon is the highlight here, and if you can get a group of pals together, this horror 4v1 is a hell of a lot of fun.",,,,"Will I be playing it two weeks from now? Hard to say. There’s only a handful of (big) maps, and there may, in fact, be a limit to how many times I can chuckle evilly as an enemy team falls into fear and despair. (God or Evil God or whoever save us from a solved multiplayer meta.) But I’m having a damn groovy time with it right now.",,,,"Evil Dead: The Game does a solid job of carving out its own bloody, aggressive take on the asymmetric multiplayer formula, but some nagging gameplay issues, frustrating single-player content, and a failure to fully capture the series’ groovy attitude hold the game back. Hardcore Evil Dead fans should find plenty to like here, but with competitors like Dead by Daylight around, this game hasn’t really earned its “hail to the king” moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From atmosphere to execution, this short horror romp takes you and doesn't let go. It's not without issues, with one progression point halfway through the game lacking the kind of intention and care that the rest of the game receives. Then there's the save corrupting error. However, once that error gets patched out, Madison will have the complete package worthy of anyone up for a good scare.",,,,,,,,,,"Although the story doesn't deliver anything fresh, it serves the game well and provides a platform for the game's excellent design and well-crafted horror. Go into MADiSON without any pretense of a groundbreaking story to find a terrifying journey through the minds of pained and neglected killers. Overall, MADiSON is a great first game by a new developer and is sure to provide plenty of scares.",,,,,,"When you’re looking for a good psychological horror released in the last decade, Madison is more than a decent place to start. It surely has its cringy dialogue moments, but with a good pair of headphones, this game will make you scream like a baby, swear at every jumpscare and most of all you’ll utterly hate instant cameras.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"MADiSON is a solid, polished indie horror game. It struggles with pacing because of the mechanics involved with the puzzles. For collectors and completionists, you may find some replay value as you can collect camera skins and special photos.",,,"MADiSON had what it takes to be a great horror game, but there is unnecessary exaggeration here. In addition, the lack of maturity of the character in the narrative makes you think that it is stuck all the time at the beginning, making the title tiring, especially with Luca's unbearable whimpering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Very classic in content as in form, MADiSON will not really succeed in standing out from its models but still has robust qualities: a horrifying atmosphere that keeps you on the lookout and surprisingly clever puzzles that will make you take out your pencil and a piece of paper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Madison is an interesting combination of old-school and modern horror, and even with its issues, manages to become a scary but fun adventure.",,,,,,MADiSON is a must-play psychological horror game that'll have you on the edge of your seat from the first second right until the credits roll.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"So turn on your Polaroid camera, prepare your gray matter for tones of multi layer puzzles and embark on this amazing horror adventure in which our Luca tries to find out is he really possessed by some demonic forces or is this all just a bad dream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite my misgivings, Madison still offers a respectable evening of frights and is worth a look for fans of psychological horror. It succeeds in building tension and puzzle variety, stumbling when it becomes obsessed with bamboozling players with head-tilting solutions and stopping their hearts with lame jump scares. But when the game hits right, you’ll be glad no one caught the look on your face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While it’s built around an interesting mechanic and features tense, sometimes terrifying moments, MADiSON is frequently derailed by tedious puzzles and an irritating amount of backtracking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a more rounded and proficient take on the vision, but ultimately it is also the exact same vision as its predecessor and, this second time around, the impact just isn’t the same. However, it is still a beautiful, emotional and poignant bit of art, and we should all be sending our politicians copies to play. Otherwise, we’ll all find ourselves travelling around our crumbling, drowned cities soon. Just like Miku and Taku do here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Free of any combat, and largely of any challenge whatsoever, Submerged: Hidden Depths is the perfect game to relax with. Its colourful visuals and contemplative soundtrack will immerse you in a world that feels sombre yet hopeful, as you explore every nook and cranny on your modest ship. Though for some the action may prove to be too basic. Still, if you’re after a game that you can chill out with while unravelling the fate of a caring sister and her brother, this is well worth checking out.",,,"Submerged: Hidden Depths is not only beautiful to look at, it offers a nice change of pace from the open world RPG titles out there.",,,,,,,,,,,"Submerged: Hidden Depths is the perfect game to play when needing a break from the more stressful or narrative intense experiences. Featuring a powerful orchestral score, relaxing exploration and puzzle solving, and a subtle yet interesting story about the bonds of family and the power of hope, Submerged surprised me and provided me with one of my favorite experiences of the year.","Submerged: Hidden Depths feels like what the first game should have been. The main story is more interesting now, but the ancillary story lacks gravitas since the game can spoil the ending for you. The actual gameplay is easy for anyone to manage, which makes for an enjoyable experience. Some of the stuff you're collecting now actually serves a purpose, even if it's cosmetic. The experience is short if you're just going after the main storyline, but it feels just right. For those who want the equivalent of a walking simulator with more to do, Hidden Depths is well worth checking out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There's no mechanics, really, to speak of. There's no combat for us to discuss. You can't even jump on command — only at specific places. Submerged is a chillout experience about exploration with a slight story and basically nothing else, and honestly, we're okay with that. Not everything has to be explosions or sad-times-my-kid-died-and-now-I've-grown-a-beard depressing drama. Pop on Submberged as a palette cleanser between more involved titles or as an escape from the horror of reality and you'll be fine. This is fine.",,,,,"If you are well aware of the nature of the game and what it offers, it is possible to have a good time in the heart of Submerged: Hidden Depths. Thanks to its absolutely delightful universe, its peaceful rhythm and its neat soundtrack, the title of Uppercut Games does not claim to be anything other than what it is: a simple experience of exploration and of contemplation. Despite everything, drowned under a ton of dispensable collectibles and served by an optimization not always perfected, Submerged Hidden Depths certainly does better than its predecessor, but does not completely manage to embark us in its universe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A relaxing collect-a-thon adventure game, Submerged: Hidden Depths is visually stunning with graphics that are comparable to those of big budget titles. Although the story lacks depth and the main mission can feel a bit repetitive, if you want a game that is very chill and completely devoid of stress, this is worth picking up.",The follow-up to Submerged reaps the rewards of its simplicity while also paying a price for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With no timers, no combat and barely any challenge Submerged: Hidden Depths is a super chill if overly shallow adventure that makes a good palate cleanser between bigger titles.",,,,,,"A simple adventure offering a short journey across a ravaged world, unfortunately the story doesn’t unfold as well as it could have done and the puzzles and platforming sections are very basic.

It provides players with some new options for builds and a few fun loot, but its 3-hour story and overall really small amount of content make it look like an incremental free update that tries to scam its players by paying full price for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Outriders Worldslayer is a considerable upgrade from the original release. The introduction of a new tier, tree, and a more balanced gameplay design helps to make the case for more content down the road. It certainly feels like it’s on the right path to perfection, but still struggling in some minor areas.",,,,"Worldslayer's biggest appeal is its increased loot pool and finalized endgame, but players shouldn't expect more than a few dozen hours of gameplay before running out of content. The existing bugs aren't enough to completely ruin the DLC, and are likely to be fixed with a launch day patch or later update. Those who enjoyed Outriders after its New Horizons patch (or are looking for an opportunity to join the franchise) should experience Outriders Worldslayer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Outriders is a game that launched with an array of bugs, glitches, and crashes during its initial launch. It’s probably the best time to jump in and play Outriders right now, especially after the free New Horizons update along with this massive Worldslayer DLC. The new expansion comes at a steep price point, but shines with its polished endgame content and loot pool. Sure, it can get repetitive, grindy, and tedious, but that shouldn’t be a problem if you’re into this type of game. Just make sure you have two buddies who are down to play with you because playing solo just isn’t that fun.",,,,,,"The campaign for Worldslayer feels uncomfortably chaotic. It has the story beats of a great tale but doesn’t fully tell the story. If it was meant to deliver a sense of urgency there are aspects that could have been cut. I and many others who played see so much potential for it to have rivalled the narrative of the main game and it’s unfortunate that it is so short. Despite its shortcomings, all of the other new content and enhancements easily make up for it. This is Outriders the way it was meant to be. This is the power fantasy we want to feel in gaming.",,,"Worldslayer might not justify its price tag in content, but it sure does make for fun. Although not many, the new content is enough to guarantee good hours of fun and a great return to Enoch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Outriders: Worldslayer delivers on its promises without giving the player an extraordinary experience to remember. In addition to a new skill tree as well as expanded gear mods, you can further customize your character to face new challenges. The story is told in a better way than the base game, but the endgame feels more like a stepping stone for progress than a final shot at the narrative.",,,,"Outriders Wordslayer is definitely the expansion that fans of Square Enix's Looter-Shooter have been waiting for. Without ever revolutionizing either the game or the genre, this DLC is extremely generous in content and offers enough new features to encourage players to return to the planet Enoch. People Can Fly refines its title in its own way and spices up a desired nervous and gratifying adventure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Outriders Worldslayer brings a fresh campaign and endgame to People Can Fly's game, but likely won't move the needle for those not already gripped by this third person looter shooter. The chaotic front-foot combat is fun, the boss battles challenging, and some of the weapons and abilities gloriously excessive, but many of the underlying flaws remain.","Outriders Worldslayer is a decent expansion to a game that was flawed upon its release. Loot is plentiful, and playing with friends over comms can be a blast. The repetitive gameplay loop and breakneck pacing leave much to be desired, especially when playing solo. Worldslayer won’t convert anybody who wasn’t already on board with Outriders to the cause, as it shares many problems with its predecessor. Still, Worldslayer will give fans of the base game reason to return to Enoch’s world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"At its core, Outriders: Worldslayer does bring to the table enough enhancements when it comes to the actual gameplay of this looter-shooter. That entertaining combat coupled with new Apocalypse Gear, Tiers, and more are what makes the game truly tick, even if the narrative beats can be hit and miss. There is certainly room for People Can Fly to explore other parts of the world in future content, but for now, we’ll make do with a looter-shooter experience that has become even better than before.",,,,,,Outriders Worldslayer is an interesting expansion that gives us the necessary content that will make us play again. Now with the new levels we will have more challenges and more loot.,,,"Worldslayer is a modest DLC that offers interesting content regarding the end-game mode, at the expense of a campaign that doesn't add anything new to People Can Fly's looter shooter.",,,,,,,,,"If you’re looking for more brilliantly brutal gunplay and satisfying supernatural shootouts, Outriders: Worldslayer delivers the goods. But there’s a solid chance your mileage will vary depending on what you hope to get out of the DLC. If you love fine-tuning your builds and tackling the highest World Tiers, Worldslayer will keep you glued to your controller for the foreseeable future. However, if you’re the type of player who’s strictly in it for the campaign and quest lines, you’ll probably want to wait for it to go on sale before pulling that trigger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin,,,,"Regrets? Team Ninja may have a few. It's chartered course doesn't seem particularly well planned, nor its steps along the byway especially careful - and it certainly bites off more than it can chew. Yet while this curious, distinctive spin-off may not be close to the finest hour for its developer nor this storied series, its' makers can stand tall knowing that, to paraphrase Ol' Blue Eyes, they did it their way. [Issue#371, p.108]",,,,,,"Stranger of Paradise is one of the strangest Final Fantasy spinoffs I have ever played, but it does not necessarily mean it’s a bad game. Yes, it has a remarkably bad cast of characters and story, but still has strong points that make it a decent game. Packed with some truly enjoyable combat and nostalgia, it’s a game any fan of the series will know how to appreciate.",,,"Stranger of Paradise is the perfect example of gameplay towering above the sum of its parts. I loved the combat and job system, which allows for dynamic battles and strategy. It's just a shame that the rest of the game feels low budget and unfinished. If you're looking for an origin story to the original Final Fantasy, you'll get it here, but chances are you may want to forget it as soon as you're done.",,,"The story of Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin doesn't really come together until the last few hours, but when it does it blends nicely with a solid and engaging action combat system and a heavy dose of nostalgia for the series.","Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin constantly balances between homage to the series and bombastic kitsch. The new gameplay - it feels more like a soulslike game than your typical action-RPG - is refreshing at times, but not spectacular enough to make the game rise above mediocrity.",Quotation forthcoming.,"If you look at Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin as a hack-and-slash action RPG, it’s a roughly balanced game with problematic endgame content that isn’t any better in the visual department either, and even its story seems to be a huge disappointment at first. However, if you stick with it, the well crafted battle system and the job system that allows for a wide array of fighting styles should win you over, and eventually you’ll be rewarded by an extremely passionate and overwhelming finale to the story.","There’s not much by the way of emotional connection to this game. It’s old-fashioned, cliched in its storytelling and I found myself constantly hitting the skip button to get to the actual fighting. But overall, Stranger of Paradise is a nice brawler on the Playstation and Xbox.","Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin does a fantastic job on the gameplay department, but fails at almost everything else. The combat is fun, and the class system gives the player an immense amount of freedom to play however they want, but the lackluster graphics and pretty straightforward levels certainly ruin some of its most epic moments.",,"Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin seems to prove that the Final Fantasy franchise can thrive in the action game scene with this first franchise venture from Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo. The title isn't a true home run, but it is an exciting adventure that expands the franchise lore in a unique direction. The Final Fantasy Job system is as interesting and exciting as ever and adds a unique twist on the action game format as players grind through each challenging dungeon and fill in all the Job talent trees one by one.",,"Stranger of Paradise is violent, dark, and brilliantly captivating. It’s a must-play for Final Fantasy fans. Steeped in sentiment and lovingly crafted homages to our favourite games, it offers a new mystery to unravel and breaks the mould of what you’d expect from the series. You might miss having a wide world to explore, proper side quests, and all the usual trimmings, but there’s a lot to love about Stranger of Paradise that you won’t find in your back catalogue of FF games.","There's a half-decent time to be had bashing your way around Stranger of Paradise's dungeons, but routine level design, rough edges and messy narrative delivery stop the experience evolving into a compelling adventure. Despite its efforts to create ordered systems, chaos has the final word.","I have to wonder if the gaming audience is quite ready for the kind of metatextual experience that Stranger of Paradise presents. It’s not only a game that doesn’t take itself seriously, but it outright challenges players’ expectations on how games are made and how they should be played. It’s hugely entertaining and as experimental as Final Fantasy at its best, but I do wonder how well something so reflective will click and be remembered as a great in the longer term. I only hope that people realise that the nonsense of Jack, his iPod, and his obsession with Chaos is just the surface of this brilliantly smart, layered thing, and they then take the time to dig into what Stranger of Paradise is really saying as a work of metatextual satire.",,"This is not full-fledge Final Fantasy as you know it, but good spin-off to remember. It gives you another shot at Souls genre and is accessible to more players. Action hack-and-slash system is solid and you can spend 30-40 hours in dungeons, fierce battles, grab plenty of loot – and it is fun.",,,"Stranger of Paradise tries to marry Final Fantasy with a soulslike, while also often reaching outside this genre. The whole idea was great, which makes the poor execution (uninspired level design, run-of-the-mill story, mediocre graphics, boring boss fights) even more disappointing.

It re-tells the story of the very first Final Fantasy, but is also an Origin story. It tries to pay homage to 35 years of FF games, but also provide a new experience. It wants to be a Souls game, but without the Souls difficulty, a hacker-slasher and a loot game. Against a backdrop of sub-par graphics, some choices work, some don't. The combat is pretty good, while the graphics, level design and story let down.

It is a good choice for fans of the franchise and lovers of the genre.","It started out as a collection of the looser story ideas that seemed to go nowhere, but slowly but surely Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin pulled it all together and managed to keep it level - although you want to make sure you scour it for collectibles. If you want the full effect of your revelations, a solid and immersive action combat system can be tweaked to be as challenging as it is rewarding. Along with versatile character customization that lets you mix and match dozens of interchangeable jobs, your character fights as you see fit and gives you the ability to experiment and find a winning combination in one or three player co-op. There's significant room for improvement in the tools it offers to manage the avalanche of gear that drops on every mission, but the nods to Final Fantasy history sprinkled throughout its levels are enough to deflect attention from this sort of thing.",,,,"Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origins is a strange, ridiculous, and largely delightful game. You have to accept a game that is almost painfully free of irony and self-awareness, but if you do, you'll find one of the most enjoyable spin-offs to carry the Final Fantasy name. The combat is fast, frantic, and fun, and the customization options are through the roof. The only thing that holds it back is if players enjoy the story in the same campy way as Resident Evil 4 or only find it to be frustratingly unfun.","The story of Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is so bad it almost gets good again. Almost, but not quite. Underneath that ugly fever dream is an interesting and deep combat system, which pulls the game from doom.",,"Underneath cringeworthy writing and a nonsensical story, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin leverages storied Final Fantasy fanservice with a fast and deep combat system to offer up fans a celebration of the franchise like no other.

Thankfully, its awesome stage designs and intricate character customization component ended up shining brighter than the humdrum story and disappointing visuals.","Team Ninja delivered on Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. Maybe the visuals are not that good, but gameplay is good enough to keep the players hooked up to the game. You can truly feel the differences between the classes and the character progression. The multiplayer is also pretty fun.",,,"Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin is an action-oriented RPG whose gameplay mechanics are almost entirely based on those of Nioh, one of the most prominent Dark Souls clones. The game is a bit outdated in its layout and it seems to come from another age.",,"An absurd game in the spectrum of Final Fantasy, but in a positive sense. The many boss fights, the cool combat, good AI and more make it more than worth it. You have to love it, as it is anything but a traditional Final Fantasy game, but in what it tries to do, it succeeds in its mission. The gameplay is engaging and manages to entertain, which is ultimately the most important thing.",,"Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin thinks that it's Daniel Craig's James Bond but it's actually Austin Powers. There's barely a moment in the game that isn't stretching credulity, be it the absurd writing, bewildering story, or inane characters. There's a host of technical issues, too. But somehow, despite everything, it manages to fail upwards and be a pretty good time. Maybe we've lost the plot but we liked it.","Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is absurd, daring, and very entertaining, but its story takes a long time to start, which affects the playing experience from the beginning. You will notice that you shouldn't take the narrative so seriously because it doesn't get you anywhere. Nevertheless, the references and the combat system keep you wanting more because it's a challenging title.","This action RPG boasts a good combat system and impressive freedom in designing your own hero class. The story is awful, however, as are the loot and the graphics. Stranger of Paradise isn’t a waste of time - but that time could still be spent playing much better games.","Stranger of Paradise gives Florian a bit of an inclination to wash his eyeballs with bleach, so he gives the game a tight 6, but Samuel enjoyed the unique twist on the Souls action so much that he wanted to give it a big thumbs up. heeds. There is a good chance that the 'truth' for you lies somewhere in the middle.","Enjoyable Souls-lite combat can’t make up for the tedious loot system and laughably bad storytelling, in this misconceived Final Fantasy spin-off.",It remains a very effective action game that pays homage to games in the Final Fantasy franchise and promises to be even more enjoyable to play in multiplayer.,,"Self-aware humor permeates throughout Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin, and by and large, it works really, really well. Any fears I had about Stranger of Paradise were dispelled after a dozen or so hours with its phenomenal combat system, strange but genuine story, and a surprising commitment to celebrating everything Final Fantasy — all through the eyes of an angry edgelord named Jack.","Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin is a wacky game that will end up being a cult classic. The devs were not afraid to march to the beat of their own drum, and the result is the type of slightly messy, unique AA game that we used to get in the late 2000s and early 2010s. It’s goofy, flawed, and fabulous, and I hope Square Enix continues to lean into publishing more experimental titles like this.","While our initial reaction to Stranger of Paradise was one of indifference, the game managed to charm us once we gave it more time. It then became an enjoyable and relaxing experience that didn’t outstay its welcome or descend into too much of a grind. It delivers a fluid and engaging combat system that borrows from other successful games in Team Ninja and Square-Enix’s back catalog of hits. Stranger of Paradise is not the game that’s going to pull most players away from Horizon Forbidden West or Elden Ring, However, it’s a nice distraction to keep Final Fantasy fans occupied until the sixteenth main entry arrives -- whenever that may be.","Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is a rough gem: it reinterprets the videogame approach already seen in the Nioh games, declining it in a “Final Fantasy way”; it presents an antithetical narrative to every possible trope of the genre and, above all, of the saga in question. The game lacks however of that polish and, perhaps, of the courage that would have made the difference between a good game and a little masterpiece.","Not at all what you would expect from a ""Final Fantasy"", but with action packed gameplay, buttery smooth battle choreography, RPG elements that are as sophisticated as they are challenging, and high replay value. However, those who want to be rewarded will have to live with a certain learning curve and unconvincing characters.",,"It's clearly Team Ninja's gameplay expertise that saves Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin from disaster. It takes a monster foot to move from one class to another while becoming familiar with the finesse they abound. Because yes, given the low technical level, we have the impression of dealing with a PS3 / Xbox 360 game. It goes hand in hand with the story which is being demolished by this constant silliness.",,"A series celebration that rides the line between edgy mature and camp humour, it’s great to hack through even if others do it better.

The result is passable, but not the great game it could be.",,"I almost have to admire the audacity of how blasé Square Enix is with its own history, and wonder how much of Stranger of Paradise was intended as comedy. Is it irreverence or just laxity? If you thought Final Fantasy 7 Remake took liberties with its source material, at least there seemed to be a purpose and intent behind it. Stranger of Paradise meanwhile feels like an ill-thought fanfic, given free rein to ransack the back catalogue.",,,,I didn’t expect to enjoy smashing the heads of monsters like this. I also didn’t expect to enjoy a story about a hyper-masculine man like Jack. But what I’ve come to learn in my time with Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is that Jack isn’t a knight in shining armor. He’s better. [Review in Progress],"Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origins re-imagines the earliest Final Fantasy in a manner befitting of a popcorn action film and for the most part succeeds. The story is an interesting re-interpretation of the Warriors of Light even if there are a few elements that seem nonsensical and shoehorned in. Like most things involving a timeloop, it’s just better for one’s sanity not to contemplate the finer points of the story too much. A lot of the story wants to be taken seriously, but Jack’s over-the-top obsession with killing Chaos brings the overall tone into comedic territory. The gameplay is frenetic action with several difficulty options to make it accessible to newcomers and challenging to veterans of the genre. Approaching Stranger of Paradise with any sort of expectations of what a Final Fantasy game should be will likely lead to disappointment. When viewed through the lens of a campy B-movie, however, killing Chaos can be a thrill.",,"As a spin-off, it has some interesting ideas, but the execution is not good enough for the franchise it’s based on.",,"Stranger of Paradise is one of “those” games - a scuffed diamond that's a joy to play, yet has unmissable imperfections. However, while annoying, a poor story and bland visuals don't diminish its punchy RPG action, nor its rewarding web of character customisation options. Needless to say, we’re pretty eager to see how Stranger is received by the Final Fantasy fandom.","Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin is an undeniably stellar action game boasting addictive mechanics that will cater to a myriad of crowds. Even when accounting for a few minor critiques, the combat is some of the best the franchise has to offer. Further, its clever writing choices and conclusion will undoubtedly be lasting and impressionable for those engaged by the narrative.","Stranger Of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is a canon installment in the Final Fantasy franchise, but with the shell of Nioh. Its map, process and task modeling have clearly borrowed from Nioh, but it still seamlessly maintains the career and combat systems of the Final Fantasy tradition, which brings us a core gameplay style markedly distinguished from Nioh. The moderate death penalty and abundant skills make the exploring process less ""painful"". Similar to Nioh, however, the gaming experience after you have cleared the main story is a repetitious process of killing mob and collecting loots and does not feel like a hard-core action game. The game's graphics are unremarkable and its optimization has certain problems, but these do not significantly impact the gaming experience. The game is set in the world background of Final Fantasy 1 and integrates the elements of the previous installments of the Final Fantasy franchise, so its design will feel quite nostalgic to the die-hard fans of the franchise.",,"This new flavor of Final Fantasy is mostly created with borrowed ideas, but still implements them well enough to be genuinely fun and addicting most of the time.","Credit should be given to Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin for trying something different, and nobody could argue that it certainly is that. With a distinct lack of the plot and character polish, players approaching this as an RPG can easily overlook this. With such excellent combat options and a real sense of fun throughout, though, it more than stands alongside its peers in both the role-playing and Souls-like genres. Why it looks so bad, that's a mystery in itself…","We finally got to thoroughly test the particular Square Enix experiment in collaboration with Team Ninja. Despite some good ideas, Stranger of Paradise is a mediocre action game, not really inspired and with not in depth mechanics.","Thanks to a level of difficulty calibrated downwards, we recommend purchasing it to those who up to now have kept away from Nioh and more generally from soulslike ones, as they are intimidated by the high level of challenge that distinguishes the genre. With the support of companions and the difficulty selector, on the contrary Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin could be the perfect opportunity to try something new and broaden your gaming horizons.",Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin looks like a Nioh reskin with some Final Fantasy add-on like classes and monsters. Is a step backward due to an uninspired level design and a shallow story.,,,,,"Team Ninja created a hardcore action-RPG with an interesting combat system, but some missteps -like the awful dialogue, the mediocre level design and the bland story- keep it from achieving greatness.",,"Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin will continue splitting opinions. If anything, all this division is a testament to the passion that this series has cultivated since 1987. Ate the end of the day, we have a mechanically sane, yet narratively inconsistent game, with meme culture contributing to the heavy criticism for a plot that is, in truth, very confusing.","Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is a B-movie game. It’s loud, dumb, and full of fun. You have to ignore a lot – a lot – of issues if you want to extract the joy from its chaotic heart, but once you commit, toy around with the weapons, penetrate its poorly-explained mechanics and forgive Jack for his one-dimensional personality, you’re left with a game that’s part Devil May Cry, part Nioh, and part Face/Off. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t want to play that?",,"Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin's story doesn't come together until the final hours, but when it does it pairs nicely with a solid and engaging action combat system and a strong dose of FF nostalgia.","With a good combat model and outdated visuals, Stranger of Paradise is a mixed bag of a title that has a lot of fun gameplay. If you want to see what the predecessor of NIOH would look like - this game is definitely for you.","Badass fights, a great score and some tough as nails bossfights make Strangers of Paradise a worthy Final Fantasy spin-off. If you’re in for a great story, look elsewhere.","It’s a mouthful of a title and it’s a weird game. It’s Nioh to the core with Final Fantasy nostalgia smeared all over it. Laugh at the dialogue, stay for the great combat system. It’s not perfect by far, but all it takes is a single great thing to make something shine.","Ultimately, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin will please those who are willing to buy into the ideas it presents wholesale and is a solid action game. However, despite all of the praises I have to sing for it, it’s obvious that this game was made for a very specific audience in mind and won’t be for everyone.",,"Stranger of Paradise is a peanut butter and chocolate combination of Final Fantasy XV and Nioh. The beauty of it is that you don’t even have to be a fan of Final Fantasy I to enjoy Stranger of Paradise. The story explains everything you need to know and anything you bring into it from previous knowledge is just extra. The combat is just spicy enough that you can feel like a powerhouse, but lets the players somewhat tweak the difficulty to their own desires if they’d rather face a tougher challenge. If this is the way that Square Enix will be remaking the early Final Fantasy games I am entirely in. This iteration takes modernization to the best possible level.","As much as I want to love this game as a whole, the story lets it down. As a newcomer to the Final Fantasy franchise, the storyline would put me off of playing any more if I didn’t know that some of the other games are renowned for being incredible. Having a story that I can be invested in from the very beginning is what makes a great RPG. That being said, the combat and build up to the various boss fights were unarguably brilliant. I haven’t experienced such joy from the intelligent use of repetition in any other fighting game. From being able to tailor the intensity of each battle to my own experience level to building Jack to be a character I enjoyed, combat is truly where this game shines.","With Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, Team Ninja has produced yet another rather good Final Fantasy action game. With its deep yet more forgiving combat system, it can appeal to those not seeking the challenging experiences of something like Nioh. Furthermore, with its complex mix-and-match Jobs system, it brings a uniquely Final Fantasy flair to the hack-and-slash genre. Unfortunately, its dull protagonist and plot may struggle to keep the attention of anyone curious about the backstory it is trying to create for the original Final Fantasy. The loot system could also do with some overhauls. Still, you can certainly do worse than Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin if you’re looking for a new multiplayer action game with some clever Final Fantasy twists.",,,,"Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is a game that if we can see beyond the spare parts, is a title that will entertain us all along the adventure. What stands out is its artwork system and gameplay, which make it a very deep and very fun game.",,"Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin will go down in history for being memorable for better and for worse. Many of its sections are a mess, but if you can get past its flaws and learn to enjoy them you'll find a game that will entertain you immensely. Especially if you love action RPGs with rewarding combat and progression systems.",,"If you want a game to be fun above all else, then Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin might be for you. However, it is necessary to have a certain distance on the whole of the new production of Team Ninja, since it is filled witch clichés that should absolutely not be taken at face value in order to be appreciated as it should be. Skillfully mixing the gameplay of Nioh with the jobs and worlds of Final Fantasy in settings unworthy of our time, FFO is the very definition of guilty pleasure. A good game, not to be put in all hands.","Stranger of Paradise is the strangest Final Fantasy game yet, bounding wildly between awful and fantastic. If you can tolerate Jack (and that’s a big ask), the excellently crafted combat is worth a look. You may be coming to this game for the story and Final Fantasy experience, but it’s all about combat and little else.","Although the action is extremely enjoyable, game stumbles in other areas. It's a direct purchase for the fans of the series, but others can wait for discounts.","When paired with the “so bad, it’s good” story and dialogue, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is a good time for the partly the wrong reasons. Critically, it’s not great. You’ve still got a car crash of a game on your hands. But, it’s a car crash you can’t look away from. In the meantime, the combat and job system is a rollercoaster ride which takes you right past it, being a wild ride in its own right.","Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is an enjoyable experiment in melding Soulslike conventions onto a Final Fantasy skeleton. However it undercuts itself by not daring for more complexity, setting up great narrative and gameplay turns that never come to pass.","Narratively speaking, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin would be a badly written JRPG, but luckily Square Enix and Koei Tecmo’s latest game is more than anything a very engaging action game that is very faithful to its source. Not perfect by any means but still enjoyable, the Nioh “soulslike” formula applied to the epic of Final Fantasy gives flesh to an interesting action game with a surprisingly deep learning curve and accessibility options that welcome any kind of player to the party.",,,,"You should play Stranger of Paradise for its combat and not its story. While there are nuggets available for series fans, this isn’t the pinnacle of storytelling by any means. It’s best to dive into the gore rather than the lore; fight for fun, be like Jack and focus on the Chaos. Certainly don’t expect this to be a brilliant subversion of the original Final Fantasy’s narrative.",,"Stranger of Paradise, despite its poor story presentation, manages to be a great spinoff for the Final Fantasy series, with gameplay beyond my expectations. It's time to destroy the Chaos! Wherever it is!",,"A story that struggles to convince, an archaic and technically outdated game structure... Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin largely misses its rendez-vous with the saga's origin.",,,"If you're curious about what Final Fantasy would look like as a Souls or Nioh-style action game, Stranger of Paradise is a solid effort. It's just a shame that it's bogged down by its oddball narrative choices and its cumbersome loot system, which makes the total package such a mixed bag. I suppose it's the nature of this chaotic beast.","Strangers of Paradise is a loveable action-RPG despite its best efforts to spoil itself with a story that only becomes interesting in the last hour. The action is a little messy and not all of the moving parts gel together perfectly, but it's got a compelling janky charm that is hard to ignore.","While it might be confusing and memey, disjointed and weird, Stranger of Paradise is also a lot of fun. It's full of cool combat with a wide variety of options, and a job system that lets you customize your playstyle or just try out what feels like 30 different ones. Its challenge makes every fight a battle of skill, while also giving you the tools to feel like a ludicrously powerful Final Fantasy badass. And despite being bizarrely delivered and wildly strange, there is a delight in uncovering what the hell is actually going on in the game's story and the weird ideas it brings to bear on the Final Fantasy series. Stranger of Paradise is mostly a more focused version of Final Fantasy that shows some different directions for the series from its traditional games, even if those directions take it down paths that are sometimes a bit...stranger.",,"It can be challenging to wrap one's head around Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. On the one hand, it is utterly steeped in Final Fantasy mythology. And yet, it's a far cry from a traditional Final Fantasy game. In a way, it feels like an attempt to apply the Final Fantasy VII Remake approach to a game much less suited to such treatment, with fascinating, if not entirely successful, results. Fans of heavily customizable action games will find a lot to love but might be divorced from the nods and homages to Final Fantasy history. It'll be the players who have a foot in both worlds that will most enjoy Stranger of Paradise, but despite some narrative pacing issues and a bit of bloat, most players will find it an enjoyable, action-packed fantasy adventure.",,Stranger of Paradise is a mechanically rich and satisfying action RPG marred by poor balancing and performance issues.,"Certainly a title for Final Fantasy fans to dive into, even if it’s just to experience the story and read up on the lore, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin has something for many gamers to enjoy.","Stranger of Paradise is mostly just a mess. When the gameplay works, it works surprisingly well, but that wasn’t often enough to make it fun for its entire runtime. It’s hard to make a judgement on the story, mostly because there isn’t much of a narrative, but it’s even more disappointing because I wanted to spend more time with the characters, because they’re far from unlikeable. A grand ode to Final Fantasy it is not, and it fails to appeal to the JRPG lover in me on most counts.","Final Fantasy Origin will enthrall players with its dumb, but awesome story and approachable Soulslike gameplay.",,,,,,,"Final Fantasy Origin: Stranger of Paradise is a chaotic alternative retelling of the very first Final Fantasy, following the story beat by beat until it transforms into something unique in its own way.",,,,"Despite all the memes and jokes, Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin is a surprisingly earnest tale tied to an astounding combat system that is impossible to put down. Not only that, but it somehow manages to remain reverent to the original Final Fantasy and the series as a whole. I think anyone who enjoys both action RPGs and Final Fantasy will enjoy this game, too.","Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin attempts to fuse the original’s sensibility into a fast-paced action RPG. For the most part, it is successful with intense action gameplay and beautiful music. Adjustable difficulty options and online co-op make the game accessible to a myriad of gamers without diminishing challenge or sacrificing replayability. It’s somewhat fitting that in this topsy-turvy action spin-off, the only thing that’s truly upside-down is the presentation of the original game’s story. Even as the narrative stumbles, the core gameplay is strong enough to motivate to see this story through to completion, no matter how chaotic.",,"Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin is undoubtedly a fun chaotic romp that will delight number crunchers and action RPG aficionados. Even though I found the characters and some of the story lacking, I still had a really good time testing out new jobs, exploring the various levels, seeing all the easter eggs, and devising strategies to tackle the level bosses. I’m looking forward to grinding gear with friends and finding out what the future holds with this new spinoff series of Final Fantasy.",,,,,"“Final Fantasy meets Nioh” is in easy assumption to make about Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, given appearances, and while that’s not exactly inaccurate, it’s an incomplete description. Team Ninja’s pedigree and inventive riffs on Final Fantasy staples makes for an action RPG that’s hard to put down, but what really sets Stranger of Paradise apart is the subversive way it approaches its source material. This isn’t your typical origin story; it’s a deconstruction of that first Final Fantasy and a reflection on the legacy it left in its wake—one that’s entertaining, often funny, sometimes biting, but above all, is willing to question its own canon in a way that you don’t often see from a series as high-profile as this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
saturnalia,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Saturnalia is a striking homage to Giallo films and makes effective use of Italian folklore to power its horror. It’s often better in the ideas than it is in practice, but those are some damn good ideas.",,,,,,,,,,"Playing through Saturnalia's beautiful mixture of rogue-lite, survival horror, and Metroidvania mechanics feels like being among the first people in the world to experience peanut butter and chocolate. Big Trouble Game Studio and Santa Ragione have crafted an entirely new flavor profile that in just a few short years will be so popular audiences everywhere won't be able to fathom a world before the existence of said combination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Saturnalia is a game on the shorter side (well, if you are as bad as I was at it, it may go longer) but in terms of indie horror, it lands on the successful side of the fence. The kaleidoscope-esque quality of walking through the darkened streets with nothing but a match to guide your way will leave you with an anxious knot in your stomach. Saturnalia won’t be for everyone but if you love how artistic that indie horror can be, you will definitely enjoy yourself.",,,,,,,,,,"Ultimately, Saturnalia is one unique horror experience where the developer's own use of limited resources demonstrate simplicity’s effectiveness to survive.",,,,One of the most visually interesting video games of the year but also a survival horror that’s not quite scary enough to reach its full potential.,,,,,,,,,,,"A compelling detective game with multiple threads to pull you through its dark Sardinian streets. Attempts to add horror to the mix, however, often fall flat. [Issue#21, p.91]",,,"Saturnalia successfully establishes a relationship between its physical and spiritual horrors, which together pull the player into its unpleasant reality. Saturnalia is a horrible little video game, but horrible in precisely all the ways its makers intended.

operation-tango,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It packs quite a lot in to its short runtime, with plenty of variety making for a unique set of levels. The game does struggle with frame rate here and there, especially playing as the agent, but it generally looks and sounds good, and the Hint system is a nice touch if you need a pointer or two. Despite some small setbacks, Operation: Tango is well worth a try if you're after a co-op kick.",,,,,"With Operation: Tango, Clever Plays delivers here a refreshing production that will satisfy lovers of cooperative experiences. The game, with its mastered asymmetric gameplay, simply offers two totally different and yet complementary ways to play. Unfortunately, the proposal, while short, runs out of steam somewhat over time, repeatedly featuring the same mini-games or introducing increasingly confusing objectives. Despite its small flaws, the little creation deserves your full attention, especially if you are looking for an experience to punctuate one or two evenings of your summer vacation.",,,,,,,,,,"With only six missions, it’s a fun way to spend an evening or two with a pal (especially if you grabbed it on PS Plus last month), but not something you can return to too often. Replaying the game after swapping roles is fun, and offers some insight into just why you were struggling on that section, but otherwise even the semi-unpredictable portions don’t change enough to make dancing with the same partner again that interesting. But it’s good fun while it lasts, and certainly doesn’t overstay its welcome. [Issue#3, p.135]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An asymmetric multiplayer espionage adventure, Operation: Tango is a game that demands co-operation and requires good communication. The non-linear difficulty curve can make some puzzles feel out of place but that doesn’t prevent it from being a gratifying, fun frolic through a charming series of missions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Operation: Tango is a clever and appealing take on a co-op spy experience with eye-catching style and excellent music. It’s short and not all that replayable, and some of the puzzles are annoyingly silly when compared to its best challenges and conundrums, but it’s still well worth a play with a friend with patience and a keen eye for detail.",,,,,,,,,,"Operation: Tango is an entertaining asymmetric coop game for two, in which communication is not only vital but the strongest weapon available.",,,,,"Stimulating, entertaining and entirely devoted to collaboration between players, Operation: Tango is a cooperative adventure that offers a good number of puzzles but that shows also several technical and artistic imperfections.",,,,,,,,,"Operation: Tango is a solid addition to the PS5 library that offers an experience unlike anything else on the platform. With clever puzzles, charming visuals, and novel gameplay mechanics, it’s a great way to spend a couple of afternoons with a friend. Sadly, once you complete each stage as both the Hacker and the Agent, there’s no real reason to come back to it. Nevertheless, if you don’t mind the game’s relatively short runtime and lack of replayability, you’ll find a unique and exciting game that’s worth diving into. Just keep in mind that this is a strictly two-player mission. Solo spies need not apply.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
steelrising,,,,,,,"Steelrising could be a great start if you were hesitant to walk into the Soulslike genre due to the genre’s complications and difficulty levels, and while it doesn’t revolutionize or add anything special to the genre, it still offers a great setting in 1978 Paris and a solid overall experience.","Steelrising has plenty in common with others in the Souls genre and even though it lacks the polish and variety of the best, the unique setting and some neat gameplay ideas make it worth a look.",,,,,"Steelrising puts together a solid, accessible Soulsborne title complete with fun combat and simplistic RPG elements. However, the dated aesthetic combined with the overstretched narrative and the foibles that come with it make this feel like a Spider Entertainment game and more of a basic third party title. The heart of the development team shows from time to time, especially near the end of the game. But, the way the team executes this formula knocks the fundamentals out of balance, creating an uneven experience with too much of its weight on the back end.",,"Steelrising is an ambitious Soulsborne game but unfortunately its not polished enough, and it doesn't reach its full potential.",,"Ever played Dark Souls? Then you actually already know Steelrising. Unfortunately, the game is more clone than homage to From Software's games. The setting - France at the time of the revolution, but with robots - is original, but this game does not contribute much to the genre.","Wonderful and original setting with great BSO and art, good but not memorable combat system and somewhat dated graphics makes for an interesting game.",,,,,"Spiders nailed the Soulslike experience with Steelrising, providing longtime fans of the genre and newcomers alike with an entertaining and innovative experience precisely tailored to their play style. There's a lot to love in Steelrising, and each playthrough will let players discover exciting new ways to rage against the machines. Steelrising is a step in the right direction for the Soulslike genre.","In sum, there’s a lot of good to Steelrising, I had a great time doing a thorough playthrough, but a few significant drawbacks temper the overall experience and keep it from getting into that upper tier of greatness.","I want to like Steelrising, I really do, but it just won’t let me. Every aspect of the game feels like a barrier to the one thing I enjoyed: combat. Even that got boring. The characters are bland, the story is dull, the setting is derivative, and the finished product is too buggy and bloated to truly enjoy. It needed a few more turns of the key to go the distance and keep on ticking smoothly.",,"Steelrising sits right up there with the original Nioh as my favourite example of a Soulslike made outside of From Software. The spectacular alternative history backdrop is a delightful way of getting people interested in the events and people of the French Revolution, and that’s backed with some of the most enjoyable and distinctive level and environment design that we’ve seen from the genre to date. Of course, it’s not Elden Ring, and was never going to hit that level of polish or scope, however, it also wasn’t trying to. It’s very comparable to the likes of Nioh, and the sheer thought that went into making every building block within it relate to its themes and artistic vision makes it a compelling and thoughtful entry into an increasingly over-crowded genre.","Ultimately, Steelrising is a fantastic Soulslike game that offers a streamlined combat and exploration experience that's always pushing the player forward. The combat is fast and fluid, with enemies that are challenging, but never feel unfair.",,,,,"Steelrising is a unique soulslike with its own identity and aesthetic, powered by strong characters and great art direction. It doesn't push the envelope on any other aspect of the genre it finds itself in, however, which may alienate those familiar with the gameplay of the soulslike formula.","Though slightly wanting when compared with its Souls contemporaries, Steelrising still offers up challenging combat, inventive enemies, and an attractive and atmospheric take.",,"Steelrising can offer unique setting, worldbuilding and plot, but all of this co-exists with a rather simple souls-like gameplay style.",,,"The visual spectacle, creative setting and mechanical intrigue of Steelrising are never quite able to justify its shortcomings in challenge and consistency. It’s an inspiring experience that I had a good time with more often than not, but it certainly pales if you’re already familiar with the paragons of the genre. That said, rubbing elbows with French revolutionaries made for an entertaining interlude between bouts of robot vs. robot combat, and I can’t deny how glad I was to experience that.","Steelrising is a commendable stab at the Soulslike genre by Spiders. It’s visually appealing, and Aegis’ unique abilities eventually make exploration feel more rewarding while also enhancing the combat. Those jumping in should be aware that combat isn’t quite as tight at that found in the likes of Dark Souls though, and Steelrising is a bit rough around the edges in general. Still, there’s a lot to like here for those seeking out a challenge within a new setting.","Steelrising is a beginner friendly entry into the Soulsborne genre with its fairly easy learning curve and enticing alternate history French Revolution premise. The art and visual direction are unparalleled with Spiders’ amazing depiction and design of steampunk automata, but the game is ultimately bottled down by unpolished combat, inconsistent performance, and too many quality of life issues.",,"Next to Greedfall, SteelRising shows just how much Spiders has come on as a developer. There are some kinks for sure, but Aegis’ Parisian adventure is easily Spiders’ best game to date.",,"Steelrising is a very unique Soulslike game. The developers clearly tried to make this game as French as possible and this worked well. The combat is fun and the bosses are also uniquely designed. The story is where Steelrising missed the mark. All characters look the same and it's just very boring to go through. The checkpoints and currency could have been better. The Assist mode is the best aspect of this game, it helps newcomers to the Soulslike genre to give them the best experience possible.",Steelrising has the necessary gears to offer a solid soulslike experience.,"Thanks to its setting, outstanding art, and level design, paired with excellent combat mechanics, Steelrising makes a strong case for itself in a very crowded Soulsborne landscape. Occasional uninspired bosses, sketchy platforming and technical issues only slightly marred the overall experience. Steelrising is a Soulslike from start to finish, but it stands out as a game I actually can’t wait to play through again.",,,"Steelrising is a good soulslike game, with a very wide range of weapons, fun combat, and great exploration. However, it lacks in the technical aspect, which disappoints a little due to the lack of care and brings some graphical problems, frame drops and crashes.",,"I can’t recommend SteelRising to everyone, especially die-hard Soulsborne fans who relish in a story where the information isn’t spoon-fed to them. I do, however, applaud Spiders for trying to take on the Soulsborne genre. I only wish they had understood that perhaps they took on more than they could chew.",,"Steelrising is another gem from the mine that is Spiders. The choice of the steampunk, alternate history French revolution setting is amazing, and somehow the Soulslike formula works beautifully in tandem. Throw in a distinctive story and phenomenal assist mode, and Steelrising is a sleeper hit in a year where we could use another.","Steelrising is sort of an average Soulsborne game. The fascinating aesthetic doesn't hide the fact that it's repeating the same sort of things we've seen in a lot of other games, and it can't manage to carve out its own identity. That doesn't mean it is a bad title; the combat is largely fun, and there are enough little things to discover to keep you moving forward. Steelrising might help to scratch the post-Elden Ring itch, but otherwise, it's best for those who are looking for another Soulsborne to play.","Steelrising is a historical adventure filled with fast-paced action, challenging gameplay, alchemical mysteries and more Franco-British dialogue than you might expect. Although the game world feels rather empty and the side missions are quite monotonous, it is great to rewrite the history surrounding the French Revolution with mechanical killing machine Aegis.",,"Though the alternate history setting allows Steelrising to immediately separate itself from the bloated Souls-like genre in an aesthetic sense, its shortcomings prevent it from standing out in a way that truly matters. Some elements work well, and the accessibility options are very welcome; just don’t go in expecting Spiders to have reinvented the automaton.",,"Steelrising is the epitome of a solid, low-highlight Soulslike that will pass the time until the next genre smash hit.","I enjoyed my time with Steelrising much more than I thought I would. Usually, soulslikes don't come anywhere near FromSoftware's games but this is impressively close with the exception of its copious amounts of weird bugs and inconsistencies.",,,"Steelrising is an interesting take on the soulslike formula. Exploring the French Revolution in the body of an automat is definitely something that I never thought I’d enjoy. However, while things look promising on paper, the execution is quite poor. Although I did enjoy the combat and level design, I can’t get past many of all the technical issues the game still has on PlayStation 5. Even after two patches, the game still crashes after a few hours and there’s nothing you can do. There are a few other minor bugs present that don’t really take away from the experience, but it does make it clear that Steelrising needed more polish before release.",,,"The French Revolution gets a twist in Steelrising thanks to the addition of the Automatons and an alternative take on history. The game manages to present an at times engaging story and the main character is very cool. In terms of gameplay, there is plenty to enjoy, but this is somewhat disrupted by some flaws, which can be annoying. As are other minor bugs, such as dropped sound. Points that stand out, but are made up for by the otherwise fine combat and variety of enemies and environments.",,"Steelrising is Spiders Studio's best game to date, but one too many bugs and tech issues hold it back from greatness. Its combat system remains engaging and enjoyable throughout, and the unique, mechanical take on the French Revolution means it'll live longer in the memory than previous FromSoftware tributes. It's one for the genre fanatics for now, but six months down the line, Steelrising may be in tip-top shape. It's more than worth playing at that point.",,"The breakthrough hit eludes Spiders once again. This is not the polished diamond the developers might have been hoping for, but it is a fun action RPG with some cool ideas and accessible difficulty.",,"A competent Soulslike lifted by its alternate history premise and Parisian setting, but it’s not quite enough to compete with its obvious inspirations.","Without ever excelling or establishing itself as a new benchmark in the genre, Steelrising is a completely solid Souls-like that is sure to please fans of Dark Souls and Elden Ring. Yes, there are pros and cons everywhere! The technique is behind but the artistic direction wins hands down. The action phases are enjoyable but lack challenge at the end of the adventure. The level design of the various areas is quite academic but works well. Despite everything, we quickly get carried away by this demanding action game, tinged with robots, French Revolution and History. If the atmosphere speaks to you and you like Elden Ring, you can go there without hesitation.",,,,"If you enjoy the Soulslike style then it's easy to recommend Steelrising, as the game is one of the most original takes on the subgenre we've seen in terms of its setting, character, and time period. Those who've always wanted a game to combine elements of Souls with Bayonetta will also find a lot to like in Steelrising, particularly after tweaking the settings… Anyone who's not a fan of Soulslikes but is keen to try one may find the flexible difficulty a great way to get started. It's no Elden Ring, but it's certainly got something about it that makes it worth a look. After all, where else can you storm the Bastille with razor-tipped Parisian fans?","Steelrising is not the best soulslike on the market, but with its attractive design and many original ideas (unfortunately not all of them are implemented effectively) it turned out to be a fun and well-made game. Undoubtedly, the best title developed by Spiders.",,,"All the trailers predicted a great Souls-like, lifted by its revolutionary, fantastic, historical and original universe. But Steelrising just misses the point. Some more or less annoying bugs, the incomprehensible absence of French voices (it's a french game), and the fact of leaving after Elden Ring harm a game that deserved to be a little more polished and ambitious.",,"While lacklustre in some areas, Spiders leverages Steelrising’s daft premise for a 8 wonderful action adventure in a Paris steeped in history and robotics.

The hexagon system of coming to a hypothesis can get quickly tedious, and with no penalty for a wrong conclusion or choices that have any impact more than the illusion of involvement, there isn’t any replay value.

I’m sincerely hoping this title manages to perform well despite its undoubtedly niche appeal.",,,,,"The Centennial Case: A Shijima Story is a journey into a century of moments of a family and, in a way, of an entire country as well. It touches on its mythology, traditions and contradictions, without leaving its mark to the end. There is no doubt that we are talking about a timeless production that will attract only a certain type of fans, but it is also true that the quality of the direction and the acting of the sequences make it a really interesting and eye-catching experiment.","The Centennial Case attempts to engage the player / spectator, but lacks the bite of a Telling Lies or the simple but welcome interactivity with the scenarios of an Ace Attorney. The quality of the cast's interpretations is discreet and the story manages to arouse interest in those who play, but without creating the urge to discover the truth that must distinguish every good thriller. It is an experience that may be appreciated by lovers of mystery, but which does not derive all the possible benefits that a greater contextualization in Japanese culture and history could have given. In other words, the Square Enix adventure succeeds only in part, while it could have shown much more grit and character.","The Centennial Case is a unique experiment, and a solid one at that, with a good central plot and a few missteps too, first of all its high price.

Let me traipse around Japan solving crimes with her, please and thank you in advance.",,"The Centennial Case: A Shijima Story is an exceptional grouping of semi-connected detective stories. Experiencing a whodunnit while marginally helping piece the mystery together was a great combination.

Everything about its music is stunning. There are so many amazing aspects to this high-budget FMV mystery adventure, but its execution on what it has players do to solve its various mysteries is truly its biggest Achilles’ heel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anno-mutationem,,,,,,,"With extraordinary Cyberpunk world design that sucks you in from the very first moment, unique mixture of 2D and 3D gameplay, gorgeous art style, deep and diverse gameplay and exiting boss fights, ANNO: Mutationem is a true gem that is not appreciated enough, and it will not disappoint if you give it a try.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ANNO: Mutationem is an enjoyable cyberpunk adventure with enough confident swagger to distract from its shortcomings.,,,,"ANNO: Mutationem is an audacious title that successfully merges genres.

With its solid action gameplay and exciting bosses, fans of the genre will have a blast in this futuristic, cyberpunk escapade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There's surprising scope in the game — you can dismantle items to get materials, which you can then combine into new weapon modules. There are side missions and mini-games, like serving cocktails to earn money. It's also kind-of open world, albeit a very small one. While the ambition is admirable, overall we feel the game comes across as quite unfocused. It's an enjoyable experience, and everything here is reasonably good, but the result is a game that doesn't really shine, save for its rainy, neon-infused aesthetic.",,,,,"With its impeccable artistic direction, ANNO: Mutationem houses an animated universe that is very pleasant to browse for its superb pixel-art in 2.5D and its bluffing depth. Too bad the storyline it houses, though prominent in experience, is so disjointed and hard to follow. The experience makes up for it with a good RPG dimension and its correct combat sequences if not fully sensational.",,,,,,,,,,"The game never outstays its welcome, but in addition to some spotty localisation, its promise of greatness is held back by its unpolished execution.

Its poetic story choices and at times beautiful combination of visual and sound design elements make it an intoxicating blend for players who want something a little more cerebral. It's not the most taxing game for those after an interactive experience, and its short run time may leave some players a little disappointed that it's over so fast, but it successfully completes the goals that it aims for.",,,,,,,,,,,,"There’s a lot to praise about A Memoir Blue. It looks and sounds beautiful, and feels almost experimental in its design – it’s always a joy to see small developers trying something new. But it does leave a little to be desired; its short narrative fails to deliver any real punch, and when the credits roll you may be left thinking “…is that it?”. But considering its small asking price, we can’t really complain. If you enjoy narrative-led journeys, particularly those that deal in human emotion, A Memoir Blue is worth picking up.",,,,"There is hope and reconciliation here, but A Memoir Blue is primarily a tragic depiction of a person who has convinced themselves – or who has been convinced – that attainment is necessary for love. The story is fragile and a little simple but, like publisher Annapurna Interactive’s 2018 game Florence, it succeeds in creating a mood of compelling melancholy, heightened by Joel Corelitz’s exquisite soundtrack. And while A Memoir Blue feels deeply personal, it achieves that miraculous narrative trick of making the specific universally approachable.",,,"A Memoir Blue has a beautiful, varied visual style, emotionally resonant music, and a sincere — if not terribly deep — narrative. The changing and mysterious relationship of parents and children is relatable. It’s a wonderful story to experience, told via haunting, surreal images. Where A Memoir Blue collapses is in its arbitrary and often unnecessary game mechanics. I get that the main character is trying to make sense of her puzzle-like memories. Pixel hunting and awkward object manipulation don’t make me feel invested or immersed. I’d argue they work against it. A Memoir Blue could and should have been a touching short animated film.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cloisters Interactive’s first outing isn’t necessarily a mind-blowing indie hit that everyone will connect with right away.

While not being revolutionary, it manages to create a pleasant online experience rarely seen on a PlayStation platform.

Tribes of Midgard is great, especially if you have friends to quest with.",,,,,,,,,,,"Tribes of Midgard is far from a perfect survival game. While it maintains a steady loop for players to engage with, the process of scavenging, crafting, and building can be pretty boring during the first few days and relentless as deadly winter encroaches upon the player’s safe haven.

This RPG-inspired survival Rogue-Lite offers some great things, but too many game systems lack depth to engage players. The excessive simplicity of the combat mixed with a loot and a minimalist crafting hard to forget the redundant and unbalanced structure of the experience. There remains a sympathetic and pleasant universe to explore. Too bad it is impossible to do it at your own pace, because it is mandatory to join the camp after dark.",,,"Tribes of Midgard has its moments of awe buried in a mountain of grinding. Players who enjoy a long haul to get to sweet rewards will find a lot to love here, especially for only $19.99. Others who don’t have the time to invest in yet another survival game will probably want to look elsewhere, though unlocking the Survival mode can make things easy enough to simply enjoy the game on your own terms. Playing with friends is, as usual, the best way to experience this co-op adventure, over and over and over again.",,,,,,,"This compelling mix of top-down action and survival sets a strong foundation for further Viking adventures.

However, for a cooperating bunch of friends, it's a title you shouldn´t definitely miss.",,"Tribes of Midgard can be a fun, satisfying, and surprisingly friendly action-survival experience, but without the right guide and crew, you might find yourself lost at sea.

atomic-heart,,,,,,"Atomic Heart is a colorful title with a gripping story and powerful dialogue. Its universe between Bioshock and Wolfenstein absorbs you and takes you on a fast-paced adventure alongside a damn crazy and rather well-written hero. Not everything is perfect and everything remains fairly standard, but the experience is devilishly satisfying thanks to its effective gameplay, well-thought-out puzzles, lots of humor and fun. A really good explosive cocktail!",,,,,,,"Atomic Heart throws up some interesting ideas and visually is a very impressive game. Otherwise, it’s a jack of all trades and master of none that entertains with its brazenly silly throwback madness.","Outside of its interesting aesthetic, everything else about Atomic Heart feels very generic. While I may still find some redeeming features, as things stand, it's one of the biggest disappointments in recent memory.",,Mundfish arrives with a charismatic and powerful proposal that leaves us wanting a sequel.,,"Atomic Heart is a game with identity and some brilliant elements, but its flaws prevent it from offering a solid structure. It could have been so much better.",,,,,,,"Atomic Heart is the result of 15 years of thoughtful world-building and storytelling, but fails to live up to any of it. Individual parts work well, and would fair far better if the padding was stripped away, but those who enjoy combat for its own sake will be happy with the amount on offer. I’ve never encountered a world that was simultaneously so intriguing and so off-putting. Every system implemented to pad out the playtime is the antithesis of fun, yet I’m still drawn to the more bespoke parts of Facility 3826. Atomic Heart is three times too big and beats erratically, but its more confident components prevent it from flatlining.","Atomic Heart has a lot of big ideas, but it doesn't do a good enough job with the basics. With an incomprehensible storyline, weightless combat, and frustrating first-person platforming, Atomic Heart is left to stand in the shadow of the video games that so clearly inspired it.",,,,,,,,"I admire the gusto with which Mundfish approached its debut game because it’s created one hell of a world to explore. But beyond its pristine setting and ass-kicking soundtrack, it’s largely forgettable. Maybe if the gameplay evolved beyond its basic beginnings or if the story was — I don’t know, good — I might be willing to give it another go. However, given how unlikely such a monumental change like that would be, Atomic Heart is destined to be a one-and-done type of experience.",,"Atomic Hearts is an interesting case of ambitious scientific experiment.

Just bear in mind that while it may look like a AAA game, it’s not; Mundfish has achieved a great deal here, but there are signs of corners being cut and a considerable lack of polish. And so, you might want to wait for a patch or two to sort out some of its unfortunate bugs and other blemishes, but you could do a lot worse than venture into the hostile world that Atomic Heart offers.","A competent first-person shooter set against the fascinating backdrop of an alternate history, technologically advanced Soviet Union. Atomic Heart wears its gaming inspirations on its sleeve, but never comes close to their greatness.",,,,"Atomic Heart offers an unique style and atmosphere with exciting gameplay and an incredible soundtrack. The game, however beautifully crafted, falls short in various departments. The protagonist is absolutely awful and shows no interest in all the stuff that is going on in the world of Atomic Heart. That also leads to not really wanting to explore the world to find all the secrets, because the protagonist just doesn't care.","In spite of some minor technical glitch, Atomic Heart is a fun, spectacular and intense shooter, that will amaze the fans of the genre with a passion for narrative. Bol'shoi!","Setting aside the game’s pervasive Soviet imagery in these complicated times, Atomic Heart is an often impressive game with too many systems and not enough connective tissue between them. Combat and other mechanics veer between janky, confounding moments and an exhilarating flow as the complex narrative tone swerves between disparate lanes. Atomic Heart can wow you, confuse you, and frustrate you in the span of a few minutes. Atomic Heart has the feel of a classic obscured by too many ideas that never quite harmonize.",,,"Atomic Heart has several fun elements that keep the player hooked from start until the end. Although it has some technical problems, they are passable in the face of the final work, which delivers much more than players expect. Diverse combat, lots of exploration and clever puzzles are just some of the points that make this game a must-have for PS5 owners.",,,,"2023 has already been strong with Game of the Year contenders, and Atomic Heart is another one of them. It lives up to all of the hype and all of its promises; an amazing debut game for Mundfish. Nailing down a few things Atomic Heart is phenomenal at is nearly impossible because it’s extraordinary in all of them. This isn’t just my favorite game of this year, it might be one of my favorites of the decade.",,,,,,,,,,"Atomic Heart has all the premises for a great game. That is why so frustrating that Mundifsh dropped the ball by trying to do too much, and botching up some gameplay mechanics, and also by releasing a game that desperately would have needed more time for fixing the bugs that poison the experience. And while the latter can be solved through patches, some peculiar game design choices and compromises take away from the overall value. The vibes of the game are great, but when you look beyond the atmosphere you will find flaws that are much more than simple nuisances. Still, despite the disappointment, Atomic Heart is worth playing and hopefully marks the start of a new franchise, that will give the developers the chance to produce a sequel that rises to the level of expectations.","Atomic Heart is not just another Russian Bioshock, although it certainly draws a lot of inspiration from it. Mundfish's game actually has a deeper lore than it appears and is interesting. The stakes won't break any bones, but they are more than enough to keep us on our toes. Our hero and his sidekick are talkative, but never heavy-handed and the game constantly oscillates between drama, reflection and humour, and it works. Visually, it's a hit. The art direction is insane and technically, it's superb on PS5. The details are legion, and the game impresses on many levels, notably with its special effects (light, pyrotechnics, blur, etc.) but also with its animations, some of which are truly amazing. So, yes, there are a few glitches like a handful of not-so-great textures, residual bugs or rhythm problems, especially during the cutscenes which are often very average, or even failed for some. But despite this, it's hard not to get a kick out of it. Atomic Heart remains a sure thing. An excellent surprise even.",,,,"This mashup of shooter, stealth, and RPG wears its influences proudly but rarely matches them. Its alt-history setting is interesting and there are plenty of ways to approach the robot-killing, but these elements are at odds with messy storytelling and characterisation.",,"A brilliantly executed variation on BioShock with a lot of its own ideas and an original, unseen world. It's a shame about the technical problems and certain user discomfort that prevented it from going one step higher.",,"The mix of highbrow story concept and complex first person combat is certainly reminiscent of Bioshock, but this churlish homage has nowhere near the same nuance in terms of either plot or gameplay.","Frankly stunningly beautiful, Atomic Heart opens with stunning architecture and a catchy pitch before unfolding a story that struggles a little to convince and lets out dozens of dialogues that can make you wince. Remains a rather decent gameplay divided between classic and robust combat, hyper clever puzzles and barely decent platforming.",,"Although Atomic Heart is fun to play for its combat encounters, it’s packed to the brim with frustrating platforming and horrendous writing, making it tough to recommend. Ultimately, Atomic Heart feels like a Ubisoft game made by edgelords who love BioShock and Russia in equal measure. It’s a jack of all trades and master of none, which lands it somewhere near “decent.” The end result is an uneven gaming experience that has fun moments sprinkled throughout a marathon of cringe.","These are just some of the many signs that suggest the game was rushed past the finish line (including a reference to game crunch), but its problems run deeper than something that can be fixed with a couple of patches. The story isn’t explained well, the dialog is over the top, the tutorials don’t do their job, and the open world is just a boring place to be. While the combat and the linear facilities go some way to redeeming Atomic Heart, it’s not a game that I can faithfully recommend right now.","For a first game from a new studio, Atomic Heart executes many of its ideas very well, delivers a solid story, and actually manages to innovate in a genre where it would be easy to remain stagnant...Yes, its main character won’t live long in the memory, the narrative takes some time to heat up, and the modern-day curse of technical hitches are noticeable. But as a whole, Atomic Heart is an electric and enjoyable FPS title with surprising puzzle aspects, and I can’t wait to see how Mundfish builds on this hot start in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While Atomic Heart brings nothing new to the table, it brings flair to the concepts it borrows from games before it, making for a fun experience that will have your heart pumping, funny bone aching, and brain working overtime.","Atomic Heart is a bit of a surprise. It's not perfect and the open world is an unneeded dilution, but when you're in the story missions it's always entertaining, despite occasionally dragging things out a little. It can be a bit strange, but it's the self aware kind of strange that can be a bit charming. And the robots are pretty great.","Mundfish has managed to capture the thrill of over-the-top action taking full advantage of Atomic Heart’s 1950s setting and insane narrative. Every moment of gameplay is packed with tense combat against haywire animatronics. Still, all the heavy metal shredding in the world isn’t enough to save the experience from its extremely poor user interface design and lack of basic accessibility features.",,,,,,"Atomic Heart tries to do everything it can and wants: in fact, it offers a combat system that mixes firearms and powers, and then lowers everything into an open world that is a bit of an end in itself. The possibility of building custom builds is not lacking, just as there is a very detailed crafting system. Yet the gameplay ends up stumbling when the extreme dynamism of the droids is contrasted by the heavy movements of P-3 (and the use of Polymers is not enough to change the cards on the table). In terms of artistic direction, on the other hand, the title of Mundfish finds its maximum expression, also thanks to the good lighting system. We would have just preferred a greater balance between the various playful components underlying the experience.","Atomic Heart is a brilliant game, that is able to mix some beloved game mechanics in its own way, in order to make you experience an intriguing journey that will make you wonder how and when will this universe be expanded in the future.",,,"Despite a few missed opportunities to really build on the great games it’s inspired by, Atomic Heart surprised me, with a remarkably inventive world that brings to life (the tears apart) the weirdest, wildest visions of Soviet propaganda. This is a game that’s been through over half a decade of development hell, and come out the other side as one of the best first-person shooters this generation.",,,,"Atomic Heart stands out for its remarkable art direction and unique theme, in a retro-futuristic world dominated by the Soviet Union. It suffers from repetitive fetch quests, which intensely slow down the game's pace, becoming a barrier to the enjoyment of this virtual world. The story has to be approached with a touch of irony and sarcasm, but that doesn't always excuse some dubious voice-acting. Mundfish's debut has a few rough edges, but a lot of promise for the future.",,,,"Atomic Heart is a terrific game with minor shortcomings thanks to its strong narrative components, quick gunplay, and special abilities. It is not a Bioshock clone; it has its own pace, characters, and stunning artistic design, and it deserves all of the attention it can receive.",,,,,"Despite what is a promising combat formula as well as the supporting systems behind it when it comes to skills, crafting, and upgrades, there are also several equally frustrating aspects of it that hold the game back. The hope is that Mundfish is able to fix some of the more glaring issues post-launch, but right now, it feels less like a welcomed revolution and more like a nuclear disaster.","Atomic Heart is an interesting approximation of better games that is slowed down by a tedious open world, messy writing, and jarring tonal shifts.","Atomic Heart is a compelling and exciting sci-fi action RPG, with a unique and well-developed setting. Although it has its imperfections, from its slow pace to occasionally annoying combat, the exciting mysteries at the heart of, well, Atomic Heart, made it worth powering through. For action-RPG fans with a taste for alternate history settings, Atomic Heart is definitely worth diving into, and I am excited to see what developer Mundfish has to offer in the future.",,,,,,,"Atomic Heart turned out to be a pleasant surprise, a charismatic first-person shooter with gameplay ideas applied almost to perfection. Leaving aside the uninteresting open world stages, the development team managed to create a world with a remarkable aesthetic quality despite the presence of several bugs. In any case, Atomic Heart represents a good first work for Mundfish and, above all, remains a fun and brutal FPS in its Soviet madness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atomic Heart is undoubtedly one of the best first-person shooter campaigns I’ve played in years. In addition to rock-solid gameplay, the game offers an intriguing mystery and a robust upgrade system. It’s even more impressive when you remember that this is the first game from Developer Mundfish. Outside of controversial themes and a lack of enemy variety, it’s hard to point out any glaring issues with Atomic Heart.","Atomic Heart has an impressive command of aesthetics and occasionally gives you the tools to enjoy its world, but an unstable console build, unsatisfying systems and complete misfire of a script prevent these atoms from achieving the necessary fusion.",,,"Atomic Heart can be a frustrating experience, but it also gives you as the player more than enough variety to warrant a look if you are searching for an interesting shooter that has lots of options when it comes to your play style. There are some compelling ideas here, but much like the entirety of the game, they're a mixed bag. It's a little rough around the edges but there definitely is a good time to be had if you're looking for a spiritual successor to the Bioshock franchise.",,"Atomic Heart does many things well. It capably takes what games like Bioshock did before and puts a unique spin on it. The guns and powers are fun to use, fighting rampaging robots is a blast, and the setting of an alternate-history 1950’s Russia is fresh and interesting. The protagonist, unfortunately, is a deluge of awful dialogue, and the attitudes for female-presenting characters are concerning. Mix in slogging through open-world segments of infinitely respawning enemies, and you have a good game that is a few better choices away from being great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There are problems, but it is still a worthy trip to the alternate past.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pac-man-world-re-pac,,,,,"Pac-Man World: Re-Pac might be a bit basic at times, but it nails the mechanics and delivers on the production. It feels like exactly the kind of thing I would have enjoyed as a kid — which basically means I also enjoy it now as a platforming-crazed adult. I’m glad Namco is looking to its classic catalog in this way, and I’m hoping it means we get more from them in this style. Pac-Man fever? I have it.",,,,,,,,"While it brings some of the regressive issues of the era it was born in, Pac-Man World: Re-Pac is a solid remake of a fondly-remembered platformer.",,,,,,,,,,,"Pac-Man World Re-Pac brings a classic back to life and then some. While the locked camera and tricky angles might frustrate some, it is still a fun game that expands the Pac-Man universe and reminds us that this old power pellet eater still has a lot of life left in him.","Pac-Man World may not be Pac-Man World 2 like I’d hoped, but it’s still a solid classic platformer with enough unique elements to help it stand out. Those who have played the original will no doubt appreciate the nostalgia, but those like me who missed it originally will still have a good time.",,"When I find that my complaints largely have to do with wishing there was more content in a game that is already perfectly sufficient, I know that I’ve had a good time. It feels strange to call Pac-Man World a “classic,” but the numbers don’t lie. The original game sold 1.5 million units, was well-received by critics and justified a number of sequels. Bandai Namco is most justified in trying this on to see if there’s room to revive the Pac-Man World property with new games, and based on the quality of this, I’d like to see what a new Pac-Man World looks like down the track.","Pac-Man World Re-Pac is a great remake of a good game. The visual overhaul of the graphics looks great and the new QoL features help iron out some of the rough edges that are present in many games of its era. The sameness of the stages and the short runtime are blows against the game, but it's still a fun experience, and worth checking out for fans of platformers.",,,,,,"I'm not sure Pac-Man World Re-Pac is going to lure in many more fans, but the ones it already had should be happy with this new packaging.",,,,,,,,,,,"A solid remaster with improved graphics and mostly great gameplay. The controls aren't always mapped handily, but the gameplay remains solid. The many references to the original Pac-Man are great, but the frequent need to backtrack is not. The levels are well designed while the bosses have a lot of variety. The game isn't very long, thich means it doesn't overstay it's welcome.",,,,"A nostalgia grab that's meant for kids at best, even as a budget title it's hard to recommend this clearly outdated platformer.","Pac-Man World Re-Pac is a simple, short and easy platform game. Despite the new coat of paint on the graphics and animations, it's still the same PS1 game underneath. If your nostalgia for the title is high, it might be worth checking out. Otherwise, because of its low difficulty, it's a game recommended for children. The duration, however, will be short in any case.",,,,"PAC-MAN World Re-Pac is a fun 2D/3D platformer with creative level design, unique boss battles, and collectible items that are actually fun to find. From space ship battles to kart races, PAC-MAN World rarely sticks to one genre of play style for long and is all the better for it. While lack of camera control does make some sections more frustrating than necessary and the campaign clocking in at only five to six hours is a bit disappointing, there’s still a lot of fun to be had with this remake whether you’re a fan of the original or a newcomer.",,,,"I suspect that people with fondness for the original Pac-Man World, or even just this specific era of platforming games will be the ones who get the most from RePac. It's a style of game that has been out of fashion for a while, but it's simplicity could still hold some appeal. When you can get lovingly re-created versions of the standard-setting Crash Bandicoot series for the price of this though, the value proposition for a remaster of one fairly short and unremarkable game is hard to swallow. One for the fans.",,,"As a big fan of the original back in the day, I admit that perhaps Pac-Man World hasn't held up as well as I thought it would. With that being said, Pac-Man World Re-Pac is definitely a cute and colourful game that's full of fun gameplay and rewarding collectibles.",,,,,,"A classic returning in a modern guise is never wrong, but technically it is far from perfect. The camera can be very annoying and also the gameplay is sometimes hampered by the difficulty in estimating depth of the levels. Other than that, the gameplay is entertaining enough on its own and the controls are thankfully very fine. A fine remake, but otherwise not very impressive or special.",,"Pac-Man World Re-Pac is a fun look Pac in time to an era where 3D platformers were far more prominent than they are today. While it doesn’t quite outclass some of its contemporaries like Crash Bandicoot Warped and Super Mario 64, Pac-Man World isn’t one to miss if you’re looking for another solid 3D platforming adventure. Depending on how you view the new difficulty balances (or if you just really love Ms. Pac-Man) this is undoubtedly the best way to experience the PS1 classic.","Pac-Man World Re-Pac is a pretty fun remaster. Its scenarios are very varied, and its gameplay keeps you entertained. Unfortunately, the fun ends very soon, and there are few replay values.",,,"A competent, if unwarranted, remake of an amiable 90s platformer that most people have long since forgotten – if they’re even aware it existed in the first place.","Pac-Man might not be your typical platforming protagonist, but he’s earned his chance to shine – and Pac-Man World Re-Pac certainly gives him that opportunity.

Even when considering some level design oddities, there are no vital drawbacks to embracing this delightful journey. Here’s hoping the sequel receives similar treatment.",,,"Pac-Man World Re-PAC is a simple and straightforward remake, but fans of 3D platformers will surely find something to enjoy here.",,"Pac-Man returns in its first 3D platformer, with a very faithful remake of the original one.","This Re-Pac of that game that had a moderate success more than twenty years ago proves to be mostly aimed at nostalgics of the original title, eager to get their hands on one of their first playful experiences on the historic PlayStation, which can therefore be satisfied from the new Bandai-Namco proposal. Those who have not already felt an immeasurable affection for Pac-Man World for some time will not find in the Re-Pac a useful reason to rediscover this little gem of the past, yet another demonstration of how much the world of video games has evolved since that distant 1999.","Colourful and fun, Pac-Man World Re-Pac does a good job in making the glorious original game shine again.",,,,,"The visual upgrades give a fresh look to the game, however the same cannot be said for the gameplay that comes straight from 1999.

The platforming is solid, the presentation is up to snuff, and there is no beating nostalgia sometimes. The game is unlikely to garner a new following save for a curious bunch, and is purely aimed at hardcore Pac-Man fans who are looking for something new yet old to enjoy, yet, that is not such a bad thing after all.",,,,,,"Pac-Man World: Re-PAC is a classic from the end of the 90's with improved mechanics and graphics at today's level.

ride-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In many ways, Ride 4 gets its racing simulation so right. The intricate detail of the bikes themselves and the tinkering you can do with them is a testament to that.

It’s just a shame that, since its last-gen launch last October, nothing has been done to bolster its online offerings or make it a little bit easier for new players to get onboard. Still, the best bike-based racing game has assuredly just got better. If you love bikes, you need RIDE 4; it’s as simple as that.",,,"Ride 4 on PS5 is gorgeous. The textures are stunning, as are the bikes, and the improvements to how it runs are more than noticeable. That said, it still suffers from its tricky handling around corners and an irritating penalty system.",,"This racing simulator isn't for the faint at heart. Without any real introduction or soft landing, you're expected to drive like a pro and be able to drive near-perfect laps. Without that, you're locked out of the main course, the career mode, and have to resort to riding single tracks. AI is hit-or-miss and races very aggressively. Definitely not a game for beginners or those looking for an arcade racer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Outside of its great use of the DualSense, RIDE 4 is a frustrating and disappointing experience. The lack of a meaningful tutorial, an aggravatingly difficult and boring campaign mode, the absence of local multiplayer, and the greedy credit system all equate to a game that feels like it was rushed for people hungry to get a next-gen motorcycle experience. RIDE 4 feels like a tech demo of the DualSense and nothing more. For an immersive racing experience on PS5, it is better to switch gears and look forward to Gran Turismo 7.",,"In Ride 4, you’ll get an uncommonly beautiful racing game with a brilliant driving model and superb utilization of the DualSense controller. But be warned - the difficulty is punishing and the AI is intent on crashing your bike.",,,"In short, a smooth transition, whether positive or negative.",,,,,"To put it simply, the PS5 version of RIDE 4 is the best around. It manages to provide a technically satisftying experience while not renouncing to performance, and on top of that it adds the uniqueness of the DualSense features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A fairly well-rounded and solid entry in Milestone’s franchise, Ride 4 makes a similarly well-rounded and solid jump to the new generation. There’s no need to compromise on resolution or performance anymore, with the PS5 able to power the game to look its very best, but it’s really the smart take on how to use the DualSense haptics and adaptive triggers that will enhance how the experience feels.","Ride 4 is not the must-own motorcycle racing game for your brand new PS5 due to its high barrier of entry and non-user friendly systems. The PS5 upgrades might be appreciated by returning fans of the last-gen version, but it doesn’t warrant the headache these races induce on the player. From my experience, I was locked out of any fun this game might have offered. As such, I really can’t recommend Ride 4 to anyone.",,,,,"RIDE 4 is a very good racer, with a solid gameplay, a deep and renewed Career mode and many technical improvements on PS5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ride 4 on PlayStation 5 is the best version of an already gorgeous motorcycle sim. The DualSense’s haptic feedback brilliantly amplifies every sensation, and the game runs at a smooth 60 frames per second and beautiful 4K resolution.

Newcomers to motorcycle racing (or people just wanting a new game for their new PS5) are going to face an uphill climb as they acclimate themselves to the unique complexities of Ride 4’s gameplay demands. There are systems in place to make the experience a bit easier but I would have liked to see a stronger emphasis on the fundamentals of controlling a high-speed bike - and the initial license exam would have been the perfect opportunity for that. As it stands, there might be some substantial hurdles for the player to overcome before they get to a point where they feel like they’ve got a proper handle on Ride 4’s deep approach to simulated racing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
moonscars,,,,,"Moonscars has so much potential, but its ruthless battle format and flat character dialogue left much to be desired.

From its beautifully atmospheric world, exceptional animations, to its fluid and gratifying combat, makes Moonscars an absolute pleasure to play. A best in class 2D souls-like.",,,,,,,,,"I wouldn’t call Moonscars a must play game, but I can appreciate that it tries to do a couple of new things with a sub-genre of Souls-like games that has become increasingly popular over the past few years. I think there are better examples of 2D Souls games out there, but Moonscars doesn’t overstay its welcome and the combat/exploration is fun enough that I found myself willing to overlook most of the other issues. I wish the magic/special abilities were more useful, as it would be nice to switch up combat encounters a bit more, but it’s perfectly serviceable as is. So if you’re in the mood for another attempt at a 2D Souls-like, Moonscars might just be the game for you.",,,"Moonscars is a collection of good ideas executed poorly and held back by a baffling story. In the heat of battle with one of the game’s well-designed and memorable boss fights, it shines almost as brightly as those it's inspired by. Unfortunately, the saturation of the genre means it’s not enough to nail the core mechanics of a soulslike anymore, and Moonscars falls down whenever it tries to stand out. It’s a fun enough time if you’re wild for the genre, but those looking for something more unique should steer clear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Whether you’re into challenging Soulslikes or sprawling Metroidvanias, there’s a lot to like about Moonscars. Its atmosphere is thick thanks to its moody visuals and soundtrack, while its moment-to-moment gameplay is utterly engrossing once it has its hooks in you. If you’re up to the task and can accept that the experience won’t always feel fair, this is a game well worth sinking some time into.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With so many similar and far superior games out there, it's tough to recommend Moonscars with its tedious game world and annoying gameplay. It does some things exceptionally well, though, but these aspects definitely don't make up for all of its shortcomings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Even if we feel that the Moonscars formula is not at its full potential, the Black Mermaid studio delivers here a solid and often quite ingenious action-RPG. Between mixing genres with a touch of rogue-lite; two-speed difficulty; good sensations in combat and beautiful artistic direction, there is really something going on, controller in hand. It is finally two or three inaccuracies, in terms of balancing and finishing, which pull Moonscars down. Regardless, it's always a pleasure to restart a game. A good pickaxe for fans of demanding action games.",,,,,Quotation forthcoming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With better game design choices and no hard crashes – Moonscars would be a great addition to the 2D Soulstroidvania genre. It’s hard to enjoy the bleak aesthetics and the rich lore of the world when the game doesn’t let you finish it however. The combat is fresh yet familiar but every mechanic outside of that isn’t really needed. But this may be one to perserve with, if you need that Souls itch scratched.",That Moonscars is like so many other similar releases only serves to make its ability to differentiate itself and stand out that much more remarkable.

I do wish they had a new mode or two since I last played the series two years ago and that $10 next gen “fee” can be a tough pill to swallow for fans that pick up the release every year, but it still gets my recommended seal of approval. EA survives the power play, but I don’t know if they can handle another one (another hockey pun, sorry).",,"NHL 22 really takes a big stride forward in the franchise. Having it on a PS5 is a big part of what makes the difference in some ways. The haptic feedback really gives the game another level. NHL games have gotten stale in years past (15-18 come to mind in some ways). Over the past few releases, EA Vancouver has taken it to newer heights and this is a leap in a great direction.

Fans of the series will feel some slight improvements, and newcomers will receive a robust package that will keep them busy all throughout the season.",,,"NHL 22 surprises by making its debut on a new console without removing any of its modes, but those who played NHL 21 may find this version a little too familiar. X-Factors on paper should be a game-changer but are mostly underwhelming. The switch to Frostbite does massively improve the fidelity of the rink – even if character models still look downright demonic – but should that really be the biggest change to the game?

Unfortunately, the next-generation jump feels more like a stop-gap solution than a proper evolution. If you already have last year’s installment, I would be hard-pressed to find a legitimate reason to make the jump. Hopefully, the next outing will focus on bringing a more innovative offering to the rink, because lord knows this time around isn’t going to set the stadium on fire.","If you’re completely new to EA’s NHL series, then by all means, this is a must-play and would be a 9/10 otherwise.

It also provides the biggest change from last gen to current gen consoles of any EA Sports game yet. It still has its issues at its core with how the AI plays and there are bugs that crop up often, but the overall experience feels fresh and the game looks much improved. The lighting and reflections provide the biggest boost while Frostbite brings more realism to player faces and jerseys. I feel more could have been included with Frostbite on the physics side, but this will come in the future. While the modes remain the same, the updates to each are sufficient and the addition of Superstar X-Factors allows for a game-changing experience. Online, if not getting disconnected, generally works as it needs to. NHL 22 offers the right feel for a new console that a lot of sports games haven’t provided in the last two generations.","It's odd that it took EA this long to bring their flagship Frostbite engine to their NHL franchise, but now that it's here in NHL 22, the wait was certainly worth it, as the game has never looked or played better.",,,,,,,"NHL 22 delivers some good moment-to-moment hockey along with a needed visual upgrade, but the franchise feels tired and worn out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NHL 22 puts a lot of energy into promoting Superstar X-Factors, but even giving big-name players unique special abilities doesn’t have the significant gameplay implications you’d expect. This is a strong year for out-of-the-box balancing, though, and the various arcade modes have their charms, even if they’re just limited sidebars. It’s an uneven jump into a new generation visually. Plus, the choppy commentary, inconsistent tone, and repetitive cut aways during stoppages make it harder to become immersed in the hockey than it’s been at the series’ peaks.",,,,,,"Making a debut on new hardware has its pros and cons, but for NHL 22, the overt emphasis on Superstar X-Factors was a huge gamble to take that did not pay off. If this is your first NHL game in a while, then there is a solid foundation in NHL 22 with various game modes that can appeal. For fans who are hoping for more, however, it is disappointing to find little to no improvements despite all the hype, just like a draft pick that turned out to be a lemon.",,,,,,,,,,,"Playing NHL 22 is like watching a predictable team.

As usual, we also get a ton of different games modes that will make most hockey fans happy. What we do not get, however, is enough notable gameplay improvements. Even though the improved physics helps a fair amount, plenty of old shortcomings remains. That said, NHL 22 is a great hockey game, but there is still room for plenty of improvements.",,,,,,"The difference between a good or bad NHL game is often tiny. For the most part, moving the experience forward in any meaningful way is enough to get me to buy in. Maybe that’s a massive improvement to gameplay and AI, or a new mode that becomes a staple of the series. These wins are often enough to make the longstanding bugs or omissions tolerable. Problems arise when what’s on offer as the year’s shiny distraction falls flat. In NHL 22, improved visuals are there but are buggy at any given moment. Superstar X-Factor Abilities are cool but alone are not enough. NHL 22 doesn’t feel like the next leap forward for video game hockey. It barely feels like meaningful DLC.",,,,"NHL 22 didn't do a whole lot to improve on its predecessor, but it didn't have to.

It’s not the longest (at around four hours), and it may not quite have as much “Jedi stuff” as you’d want, but again, it looks stunning, has fantastic feedback throughout, and even if you aren’t au-fait with the universe, you can be impressed by the attention to detail.",,,,,,,,,,,"Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge takes full advantage of Sony’s PlayStation VR2, breathing new life into the game with updated visuals, awesome haptic feedback, and a story worth remembering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge - Enhanced Edition starts out flat but does eventually get a bit better. You’ll need to trudge through a couple of hours of bland shooting galleries to get to the good stuff, though, and even then the title is largely let-down by repetitive encounters and some dated design decisions. The game takes decent advantage of PSVR2’s innovative features, but also underlines its Meta Quest 2 origins at times. And while there’s an unquestionable novelty to existing within George Lucas’ legendary universe, it feels like the license is doing a lot of the lifting for a mostly average adventure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Quotation forthcoming.,,,,,,,,,,"Star Wars fans will love this, but don't expect anything innovative for VR games in this one.",,,,,,,,,,Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge Enhanced Edition is an excellent way to showcase the best features of a fancy new PlayStation VR2.

no-more-heroes-iii,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For better or worse, No More Heroes 3 is pretty much more of the first two games with a new coat of paint. All of Grasshopper Manufacture’s wild action, bizarre storylines, and offbeat characters are present and accounted for, as is the often-tedious grind needed to progress to the next high-octane boss fight. However, for fans of the series, No More Heroes III is still a fine send-off for Travis Touchdown and his supporting cast.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Everything considered, No More Heroes 3 is an absolute treat on PS5. With the performance issues found in the Switch version a thing of the past, the visuals tidied up, and less waiting around for loading screens, you’re free to simply enjoy the zany story and wild action of Travis Touchdown’s latest caper. And what a rollercoaster of an experience it is. It won’t be for everyone, but if you have any love for the No More Heroes series or enjoy action games that are filled with silly humour and outrageous characters, this is for you.",,,,,,,"Players coming to No More Heroes 3 for the first time will have fun with its combat and peculiar, entertaining narrative. Switch owners who played it already won’t find anything new, aside from framerate improvements and higher resolutions. While the former improves combat, the latter just draws attention to the graphical limitations of the original. No More Heroes 3 is generally a worthy next chapter in the franchise, but I expected a little more than a straight-across port.",,,"No More Heroes 3 is a title that I've been waiting for a long time, but it didn't live up to expectations.

The lack of performance problems make it so much easier to enjoy its wide variety of combat encounters, eclectic minigames, and zany story sequences. It comes at the cost of its other flaws becoming more pronounced, but it’s still a brash and daring passion project from a Grasshopper Manufacture that continues to do whatever it desires.",,,,,,,,"If this really is Suda51’s last major venture with Travis Touchdown, then it’s a passing ending for the “passing assassin.” There’s no re-invention here – if you got a kick out of the earlier games, then there is plenty for you to enjoy this time around. It might get a little stale as you fight a group of enemies in a Designated Fight for the umpteenth time, but at least you’ll look stylish doing it. If No More Heroes has never been your cup of wrestling-inspired ultraviolence, well, best move along then.",,,,,,,"A delicious stream-of-consciousness journey into geek culture is underpinned by solid combat, but undermined by filler, rough edges, and a void of meaningful cohesion.

Because of how well it embraces its absurdity, it’s a title not easily digested by everyone, but this is a must play for fans of Grasshopper Manufacture’s unusual approach to world building. Conventional battles are interspersed with unusual side job minigames to bring variety to the gameplay, even if mowing lawns to raise money for ranked assassin fights feels shoehorned into the plot. No More Heroes III’s quicker loading times and sharper graphics on PS5 are a welcome upgrade of the Switch version, but there are no other improvements or additional content to make a strong case to get this version if the original release is in one’s game library.",,"This is exactly the sequel you expected it to be.

With the performance issues that distracted on Switch now a thing of the past, and the best combat that the series has produced to date, No More Heroes III is capable of providing an overload of gorgeous, chaotic fun. With combat this good, it's a shame that the rest of the package feels so woefully outdated at times. By relying so heavily on past gimmicks and humor, No More Heroes III becomes a recommendation for die-hard fans only, rather than something that could have had a more widespread appeal had some more efforts been made to modernize the experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No More Heroes 3 on Nintendo Switch was one of the best games of 2021 despite its technical issues. On PS5, it is massively improved when it comes to visuals, performance, and load times. If you enjoyed it before and want to replay it or are new to the series, No More Heroes 3 on PS5 is a fantastic experience that had me smiling from start to finish.

rims-racing,,,,,,,,"It's clear RiMS Racing has some good new ideas and a handling system that's greatly complimented by the DualSense controller. It's a pity the bikes and tracks on offer lack some variety.

At times, the slim content can feel strung out but there's an impressive foundation to build upon.",,,,,,,,,"RiMS Racing is full of good intentions, but doesn't really excel in anything.

But for now, we remain a bit hungry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"RiMS Racing is an enticing prospect for motorbike racing fans. It’s got great audio and visuals, convincing physics, and eight of the world’s most desirable bikes recreated in stunning detail. Even better, the actual act of racing is challenging, but highly enjoyable. It’s just a shame that one of the features that makes it truly unique – fiddling with components to make sure your bike is in tip-top shape – quickly becomes rather tedious thanks to the long string of button inputs required. Thankfully you can get around it with a little bit of effort, then you’ll have a much better time.",,,RiMS Racing is an absolutely unique combo of engineer simulation and road race action and a breath of fresh air in the bike sim marketplace.,,,,"Some racing sims split the difference between arcade-like accessibility and realism, but RiMS Racing leans pretty hard towards the latter. While not entirely unfriendly to novices, this is a game geared towards the motorcycle enthusiast. With its emphasis on what happens in the shop between races at least as much as on the races itself, RiMS Racing has a supply-your-own-drama career mode, but excels in supplying an exacting and sometimes thrilling simulator of racing on two wheels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While RiMS Racing has an enjoyable core racing mode, the addition of motorcycle maintenance and plenty of technical issues on PS5 prove a dealbreaker. If you’re looking for a realistic racing game that is still enjoyable, look elsewhere.",,,"As a motorcycle racing enthusiast I have been waiting for a real Gran Turismo on two wheels for years, but unfortunately Rims Racing also falls short. The actual gameplay is more than fine, but everything around it is substandard, redundant and annoying.",,"We weren't expecting it, and maybe it's a big spark that lights up in the world of motorcycle simulations. Developed by the Italian studio of RaceWard and published by Nacon, RiMS Racing overshadows Ride with its simulated aspect reserved for purists, even if it tramples on content and technique.",,,"Finally, it seems we have some competition in the superbike video game space. RiMS Racing is a solid start from RaceWard Studio, and they should be proud of what they have built. From here, expanding upon the bike roster should be priority number one, because we are spoiled for choice in other bike racers. Just the thought of this team getting their hands on new bikes to scan, model, and record gets me excited in much the same way as hearing Polyphony Digital does the same thing to add to their roster of cars. You just know it’s going to be given the royal treatment! The parts removal/installation mechanic is neat, but a way to speed on past it would be great for those who play games to get away from the more mundane portions of a hobby. One thing is for sure: it’s an invigorating time to be a superbike fan, and RiMS Racing is a great example of why.",,"RiMS Racing is a very innovative title in terms of driving but immature in terms of contents. Its excessive difficulty and the lack of motorbikes and circuits won't have the other developers to be worried for this new competitor. Still, we cannot forget it's just the debut title in the two wheels market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"RiMS Racing is the most immersive motorcycle gaming experience to date, with the DualSense pushing this even further. With a solid and lengthy Career Mode, you’ll have plenty of chances to maximize your bike’s performance and play around with different setups. While there are only eight bikes, with the amount of depth for upgrading and testing, it’ll make you forget about variety. The bike audio is ridiculously immersive and every race feels different just based on wear and tear from the bike and new part installation. The game can also be a tool on what would be needed to replace parts on these actual bikes. What’s lacking is multiplayer due to a lack of a community and anything outside of the Career Mode. This is a pure single player experience, which is perfectly fine, and any gamer who loves motorcycles will enjoy RiMS Racing. It also only retails for $39.99 and is worth the price of admission just to experience how well DualSense is implemented into the game.",,,,,,,"A good first lap for a racing series debut, RiMS Racing is a game designed for bikers. It adds an element of maintenance and customisation to the racing formula which makes for a compelling career experience. With great action on track and a unique system off it, RiMS is certainly worth your time but has room for improvement in a sequel.",,,,,,,,,,,,"RiMS Racing is a truly unique simulator. And, for that reason, it may rub a casual player the wrong way.

Outsite of the MotoGP titles, this seems to be the motocycling simulation with the biggest potential in the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"RiMS Racing is a solid foundation for RaceWard Studio to work on.

Its game world is engaging and the new combat elements included work extremely well, but for all its size there's a distinct lack of anything new to do. Those who loved the original game's Asgard sections will likely find plenty to love, but like the other Assassin's Creed Valhalla DLC it sits firmly in the nice-to-have territory.",,,,,,,,,,,,"For the devout Assassin’s Creed Valhalla fan, there’s about 20 hours or so of solid gameplay to be gleamed out of Dawn of Ragnarok. A bit more if you want to see and do everything. But chances are it won’t particularly impress. It’s simply more of the same for the most part, with a story that fails to truly engage.","Eivor steps into the shoes of Odin for a grand stomp around a gorgeously realized fantasy realm in what has become my favorite Assassin's Creed experience of all time. Great writing, gorgeous visuals, and a ridiculous amount of content make this DLC worthy of being a stand alone game. Beyond being highly recommended, Dawn of Ragnarok is an absolutely necessity for Assassin's Creed fans.",,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarök is the biggest and most ambitious expansion yet, with great new powers to utilise.",,,"One of the most ambitious DLCs in Assassin's Creed History (and the biggest, that's for sure) with a great story to tell but, in the end, it's not as groundbreaking in the gameplay department as we desired.",,,,"Dawn of Ragnarok is the perfect expansion for what the latest trilogy in the Assassin's Creed franchise set out to tell. With a fun new world to explore, new skills and, most importantly, a very well written story that should please longtime fans of the series.",,,,,"At the end of the day, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla - Dawn of Ragnarök is a nice but not particularly special expansion pack. The plot is fun enough visit into Norse mythology, but unfortunately, that's such a well-trodden area that it feels less special to dive into it. The new powers are a cool twist on the formula, but ultimately, you're still playing more Valhalla. If you enjoyed the game, then you'll enjoy the expansion, but if you've burned out on it, then being able to turn into a bird isn't going to refresh your Viking spirit.","If you still want more Assassin's Creed Valhalla after a year and a half, you will not go wrong with this Dawn of Ragnarök. With a story of about ten hours and a big world to explore and stretch the game time to at least double that, Dawn of Ragnarök offers just that. Nothing more, nothing less. However, if you are more ready for a new chapter in the Assassin's Creed series, then you can let this expansion pass you by without missing anything.",,,,"Dawn of Ragnarok delivers the familiar AC Valhalla feel with a new twist. That's good, but does not blow you away.",,,,"Normally, I’d say that Dawn of Ragnarok is just more Assassin’s Creed, but in a different environment and with different enemies. However, I do believe it’s time for Ubisoft to get rid of the Assassin’s Creed naming scheme from everything related to Eivor’s Viking saga. I think this is just piggybacking on the Assassin’s Creed franchise without bringing anything new into the mix. Despite all of that, Assassin’s Creed fans will find Dawn of Ragnarok an enjoyable experience. There are plenty of new activities and the main story is decent for the most part. The new powers look more impressive on paper rather than in-game, but props to Ubisoft for trying. My advice is to play this like a brand-new game rather than an Assassin’s Creed expansion, although it will be hard to get past the series’ dull grind mechanics, which are quite present in Dawn of Ragnarok too.",,,,,"Dawn of Ragnarok does enough to satisfy by the time that the credits roll, but if you're burnt out on Assassin's Creed Valhalla, there isn't much here that'll reignite your interest. The mythological angle is well played, the fantastical setting is cool, and Odin makes for an intriguing lead, but after a year of DLC and updates, Valhalla's gameplay loop is wearing a bit thin.","Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok is satisfying as an expansion, keeping the game mechanics and narrative in line with the base game, but it doesn't offer enough to consider it an outstanding DLC. It will be fun for the fans, but those who left the game will not find a strong reason to play it again.","An utterly conservative DLC with everything you’d expect including a lot of stuff to hoover from the map, a few new armours and weapons and an interesting addition in the form of draining special powers from enemies – which sounds great, but the game cannot really handle the implications. In summary, there’s so little creativity it hurts.","Still can't get enough of Valhalla after all those tens of hours? Then you should get some fun out of Dawn of Ragnarök. Despite its deserted areas, Svartalfheim is beautiful enough to walk through. But yearn for a more historically accurate part? Then you better stay away from this. This actually has little to do with Assassin's Creed, and at the same time is more of the same after spending about a hundred hours in Valhalla.","The first post-season pass DLC is a substantial slab of new plot, gear, and abilities but never anything more than that. If you loved the base game, this is a lot more of exactly the same.","Dawn of Ragnarök outlines a new era for Valhalla. This DLC brings relevant and consistent novelties that really change the gameplay. Add to that an engaging epic narrative, a spellbinding new world, and a healthy dose of Norse mythology, and you have the best expansion Eivor has ever seen. Ubisoft had a nose in betting on the power of Odin and Nordic myths. However, we would have just liked a little more scope to enjoy a mythological epic worthy of Valhalla.",,,,,Dawn of Ragnarok is content that explores the purest fantasy of Norse mythology.

This is the biggest thing it has going for it, but it may also be too ambitious for its own good. The new additions offered in this content breathe fresh air into the game, but despite these additions it’s still even more Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, a game that can last over 100 hours without any of the additional content. On one hand if someone were to only play one piece of expansion for Valhalla, this is the one to be prioritized, but after playing through the main game and previous expansions, it’s hard to find the motivation to return to Ravensthorpe.",,,"With the recent influx of incredible games paired with the ample amount of innovative Norse Mythology games released in recent years, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla Dawn of Ragnarok serves as little more than a familiar midnight snack for those looking for something to nibble on in between better games.",,"Assassin’s Creed Valhalla Dawn of Ragnarök brings us a huge dose of Norse Mythology and a much-needed fantasy element to the expansions of the base game. The campaign is intense with a strong conclusion, and the added powers provide new ways to approach combat. So even with some of the typical growing pains of a new open world to explore, if you were waiting for a good time to jump back into Valhalla, this is it.",,,"The new ideas Dawn of Ragnarök plays around with are fun, but it can’t fully flourish under the weight of inconsistent writing and janky combat.",,,"The result is a rich and fun expansion, which will especially satisfy those who prefer the fantasy approach and the exquisitely action setting of the production.",,,,,,,,,,,A fantastical setting and solid story can't disguise the fact that Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok has us running through the same motions as the main game a year and a half later.,"Another Assassin's Creed quality fix for insatiable fans of Ubisoft's content-bloated games, but this time with additional magical powers. It is indeed the best expansion for Valhalla so far, but basically still one big deja vu.",,,,,"Dawn of Ragnarok might be Valhalla’s largest campaign expansion by scale, but I didn’t enjoy it nearly as much The Wrath of the Druids and even The Siege of Paris. Unless you’re a hardcore Valhalla fan or someone who is particularly enamored with finding a collecting the (admittedly cool-looking) new armor sets, wait for this one to go on sale to satiate your craving to plunder.","I have no doubt that Dawn of Ragnarok will be enjoyable for some. In truth, however, it only takes a hesitant half-step towards offering a full fantasy experience, and in not committing fully, it ends up being a shallow expansion that does little to justify its price point or its existence. I'm not sure who these Assassin's Creed fans are, the ones clamouring for a full-fledged fantasy RPG, with monsters and lighting boat cosmetics and new skins for their warbird, but clearly, Ubisoft is hoping to capture that market. If anything, Dawn of Ragnarok has made me realise that I'd much rather be fist-fighting the Pope, than taking down a fire demon with eyes made of lava.","Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarök doesn’t stray far from the Ubisoft formula that has made their games either adored or loathed by gamers. Though some may think that a third expansion for Ragnarök may be overkill, it’s the developers focus on the more mythical origins of Eivor that makes this DLC different enough for lovers of the base game to be excited about exploring the new territory of Svartálfar. Dwarves as new friends and the Muspel as new foes creates opportunities for new stories, new personalities and new gameplay to be introduced, all that make for a worthy addition to the Valhalla lineage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As much fun as I had with this expansion, I do have to admit that I feel a little let down. If this were explicitly leading into another DLC story I’d be excited, but as things are I feel more like I’ve taken a running start into a brick wall with a very cool door painted on it. I can see this as a fun experience to play as part of an overall Assassin’s Creed Valhalla experience, if you were stepping into the game and all its DLC for the first time – but as something that brought me back to the game seven months after finishing The Siege of Paris, it feels like more of a promising snack than a satisfying main meal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok continues to showcase Ubisoft's greatest works.

grim-guardians-demon-purge,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Grim Guardians: Demon Purge is a mediocre Metroidvania through and through.

There's some fun to be had here, but it's not worth the price of admission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Grim Guardians: Demon Purge is a hearty tribute not only to early ’90s platformers, but to video gaming itself, offering up stress-free thrills, comedic characters, cool co-op action, and even a fistful of secrets and surprises, all visually and aurally punctuated with delightful, nostalgic style. While not as deep, as complex, nor as prestige as its inspirations, Grim Guardians achieves its humble goals handily, offering up a cheerful dose of retro action while sporting a likable personality all of its own.",,,,,,"Those looking at Grim Guardians: Demon Purge expecting a metroidvania might be disappointed when they realise it’s more of a straightforward platformer, like the original Castlevania games. And while it is derivative of Konami’s classic series, it does just enough to give itself a character of its own. If only its revival mechanic didn’t cause issues in single-player, and it didn’t get a little weird in its later half, then it would be a pretty enjoyable jaunt.",,,,,,,,,,"Despite being technically competent, Grim Guardians: Demon Purge fails by playing too safe in certain aspects, leaning too much on its inspirations, and also by not paying attention to simple and basic things expected from the genre.

It’s not without its shortcomings as the gameplay is simply good but not exceptional and the story seems like a generic anime demon-hunting affair. Its shorter playtime works in its favor, though, as it never gets a chance to overstay its welcome. It can be completed in roughly six hours or so, but completionists will be able to get more time out of it by exploring every nook and cranny and unlocking all three endings. Shortcomings aside, this is still a well constructed tribute to Castlevania and scratches the itch for fans wanting a new entry in that series.",,,,,,,"Grim Guardians: Demon Purge is flawed in a lot of the ways it sells itself on. As a Metroidvania, it’s a really weak attempt, but as an Arcade Action Platformer it’s astounding. It just didn’t lean into one or the other enough.

Annoyances at needing to go through a second time aside, I genuinely enjoyed the stages, the characters were amusing, and each new sub-weapon altered my approach to combat in ways that kept things fresh. There’s a lot of heart and soul poured into the details, it’s one of those retro titles that truly remembers what made those classics fun in the first place.

However, when it comes to discovery and sense of wonder, Sonic Frontier’s Open Zone design can proudly stand side by side with any open world masterpiece. While admittedly many of its activities are simple, the amount of content it offers is staggering. The Open Zones and their epic boss battles make great use of Sonic’s speed, creating an experience that still feels authentic to the character. While far from perfect, there hasn’t been a Sonic title that feels this relevant in a long time.","Overall, a decent effort by the Sega team and they should be praised for their future vision for the series. Let’s hope the next title will really nail down that speed without visual compromise to give Sonic the next-generation game he truly deserves.","The end result is much better than expected. Sonic Frontiers does feel like the next step for the series, and if Sonic Team is able to deliver a sequel to the level of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Adventure 2 and Generations, we could be in for a new era for the hedgehog, one for the that we should all be excited about.","Sonic Frontiers is certainly different from what we’ve come to expect from Sonic and company – both for better and for worse. I don’t think anyone is going to compare it to Mario’s forays into open (or open-ish) worlds, but if nothing else, it definitely provides an interesting way forward for a series that has often seemed like it’s wandering aimlessly in search of a purpose. Sonic Frontiers doesn’t give it that purpose, but it does suggest it’s not far off from finding it, either.","There is a satisfying quality to seeing Sonic blitz through rings in a Cyber Space mission while thumping dubstep or crunchy post-hardcore riffs blast throughout the level. Watching Sonic take down a Titan ten times his size in anime-like cutscenes at the end of a boss fight is always a spectacle. There is always something cool and worth the effort to see or do in this game, which is why Sonic Frontiers works well despite being very repetitive in nature. Those who can fall into its groove will find plenty to enjoy in Sonic’s latest adventure, and as a blueprint for the franchise going forward, Sonic could not be in a better place.","Sonic Frontiers from Sonic Team has all the right moves with controls, level design, looks, feel, and structure. What it needs to work on is making the game more pointed in its narrative and flowing without interruption. This game has a great skeleton, now all it requires is some solid content to fill some of that narrative disconnect. It contains some great elements, but it’s far from perfect.",,Sonic Frontiers features the kind of lightweight yet engaging storytelling that should easily enrapture fans young and old – though I'd hate to be a child forced to play through some of the abysmal platforming featured throughout. Was taking Sonic open world an ambitious endeavor? Yes. Did it pay off? Absolutely not.,,,,"It may have had a mixed reception earlier this year, but Sonic Frontiers' final form is a brilliantly refreshing adventure that gives the series a much-needed shake-up. The occasional control and camera 'quirks' still pop their head up, but they appear far less frequently than Sonic fans will be used to, making for a much less frustrating experience overall. We would absolutely welcome more of this.",,,,"There’s a lot I’d like to see improved upon in a Sonic Frontiers sequel (which they should absolutely do), but I had fun playing around with the open world format, and just skipping some of the more boring stuff that I didn’t want to do. If you haven’t given up on Sonic yet, you’ll find a lot to love as you wade through some of the muck.",,,Quotation forthcoming.,"If I put my nostalgia-tinted glasses aside when it comes to my affection for the Adventure games, I feel pretty comfortable calling this Sonic's best 3D effort. I hope Sega continues using and refining this open world formula. Who knows, we might even get two good 3D Sonic games in a row if they do.","There’s a real tonal dissonance in Sonic Frontiers. It wants to be a fun platformer. It wants to be a high-speed exploration puzzler. It also wants you to feel a sense of power as you take on towering bosses, and save a world from certain destruction. But in striving for success on multiple fronts, it achieves none of these goals – instead arriving as an ambitious but lukewarm adventure-platformer pockmarked by deflating choices.","For Sonic fans, this is an entertaining adventure, with plenty of variety packed into its 20-hour running time. Chances are you'll encounter plenty of frustrations while making your way through it, but when things are going right you'll see that there's great potential in this formula going forward. 'Inconsistent' is perhaps the best word to describe Sonic Frontiers: it's a grab-bag full of ideas, all pulled off with varying degrees of quality. But there's one thing for certain: it's got a cracking soundtrack.",,"Sonic Frontiers is the best 3D Sonic in a long, long time. It’s bigger, faster, smarter, and I absolutely cannot fault its ambition. Unfortunately, it’s constantly derailed by the exact same things that have been holding back Sonic games for the last few decades. With a little more polish, I truly believe Sonic Frontiers could have been one of the greats. As it stands, it’s a frequently good time with occasional flashes of brilliance.","Sonic Frontiers has its fair share of issues, but the open world direction and varied gameplay makes it the most exciting Sonic game in decades.","When a Sega marketing executive came up with the nonsense phrase “blast processing” to “explain” the technical capabilities of the Mega Drive, it’s now clear they experienced some sort of messianic premonition. Sonic Frontiers is blast processing in video game form: anarchic, careless, silly, exciting, meaningless, wonderful. What a daft and incredible ride.",,"It may not be the most solid game out there, but it sure is a daring bet that works better than many had expected. It gives Sonic lore a new scope.","It seems like every major franchise is getting the open-world treatment. At first, you’d assume that Sonic is a terrible fit for this system. But it works surprisingly well. Every island is broken down into a nested series of combat and platforming challenges. No matter the scale, you’re still getting that essential Sonic the Hedgehog experience. Unfortunately, this also means you’re getting deeply frustrated at times. Exhausting story missions, impossible puzzles, and brutal acrobatics await. But most of the game is incredibly fun. This is what Sonic games are all about. A rollercoaster ride full of dizzying highs and crushing lows. As a game, Sonic Frontiers has some definite flaws to be wary of. But as a Sonic game, this is some truly top-shelf stuff.",,,"Sonic Frontiers manages to mix what we expect from a Sonic game with an open world full of collectibles. The gameplay is great, the soundtrack is fantastic and the graphics are good. The title lacks in the difficulty, story and in the visuals of the cutscenes.","Sonic Frontiers takes some risks, and that's good. Even in a bizarre way, it is an evolution of the franchise that brings new air and hope for the subsequent content. If you're a Sonic fan or an adventurer, you're sure to enjoy what this brave new open world includes. From the presence of classic stages to silly but enjoyable minigames, the new things are fresh air to the playground of possibilities that Sonic can run through. And even with its flaws and oddities (a bunch of them), I'll be back running through the fields of Frontiers to find what was missing in my first playthrough.","There is nothing remotely redeeming about this game. Nothing that even the most die-hard loyal Sonic Fans would or should advocate for. I hope that one day someone who cares enough about this franchise could give us something-anything of substance. A fan can hope, can’t they? A fan can hope.",,Frontiers boldly plants one foot into the future with its “open zone” structure while keeping the other stuck in the past with mechanics and level ideas that are over a decade old. This approach results in a satisfying game even if it does not push the series into as many new frontiers as it could. It still hits many of the right notes that long-time fans will appreciate and works especially hard to satisfy those who have felt like the past few Sonic games have been missing some personality.,"Sonic Frontiers is an all-around solid Sonic the Hedgehog game. The shift to a more open-world style of gameplay works almost entirely in its favor and allows the game to offer more freedom and exploration without resorting to werehogs. At heart, it's still the same basic 3D-style gameplay that the franchise has been doing lately, but the change in perspective works in its favor. Not every change is a winner, but enough are that I dearly hope that Sega sticks with this flavor instead of reinventing the wheel. Fans of Sonic will be delighted, and those on the fence should give Frontiers a shot. It's easy to see how the greater freedom (and lack of annoying gimmicks) could be the difference between frustration and fun.","Sonic Frontiers really doesn't impress in any way. Behind the technical drama, the simple puzzles and boring combat is something of a blueprint for a good three-dimensional Sonic game, but then you have to search very well.","The latest title from the popular hedgehog tries to mark a new trend for the franchise, but none of its highlights end up coming together.","Sonic Frontiers is an unsteady first run at the open-world genre for the blue blur but Sonic Team has crafted something endearing and immensely enjoyable all the same. Its core systems are fun, making Sonic’s iconic speed an integral part of traversal and combat alike while paying homage to what has come before in its Cyber Space levels. It’s not perfect, but it tries its heart out and I come away with warm memories of an uneven game.",,"Interesting repurposing with open-world design that makes fast movement fun, but stumbles over technical issues.","Sonic Frontiers is obviously a love-it-or-hate-it sort of game so thankfully, I love it. The fact that there are just so many fun things that you can do at any given time makes my brain happy and I'm looking forward to a sequel. Please make it happen, Sega.","Sonic Frontiers is a fun ride for those who love the series. It has everything a Sonic fan would want in an open world game. Except maybe for the boss fights, that are not that entertaining or challenging. The performance also fails to impress, as the Starfall Islands are filled with visual glitches and bugs.",,"Sonic Frontiers tries too hard to please everyone and this is its biggest downfall. It can be completed in around 10-15 hours if you skip all the dialogues that feel like filler anyway. The rhythm is all over the place as is the difficulty level, but somehow the game manages to be fun. It is an open world game that has flaws and strengths equally but is fun, nonetheless. What's even more painful is Sonic Frontiers is far even from an AA game, even though it pretends to be much more than this. Despite all the fun, I can't help but feel that Sonic would deserve more, just like his fans. That's not to say that some won't enjoy Sonic Frontiers, it's just that the franchise doesn't seem like it's going into the right direction.","With Sonic Frontiers, SEGA is taking risks to modernize its iconic license. Unfortunately, it doesn't work mostly because of the open world and its mechanics. On the other hand, classic levels are still very enjoyable and save the game. This isn't the return of a great Sonic that we could expect.",,"Sonic is back and in a very entertaining adventure. There is plenty to do in the game world that is presented to you. This is thanks to the fast-paced gameplay, exploration, battles and the presence of classic levels. At the same time, the titan battles do feel somewhat limited and more annoying is the high degree of visual pop-in, which is a blemish on the whole. However, don't let that stop you from giving the game a chance, as Sonic Frontiers is ultimately a more than fine title as a whole.",,"Sonic Frontiers feels like a statement from Sonic Team after years of being treated like a joke. By no means is it perfect, but this is exactly the injection of life the franchise needed after the misstep of Forces, and it's the freshest Sonic has felt since Adventure first hit the shelves. While it is wrought with minor issues, the overall package of Sonic Frontiers mostly hits the mark, with its satisfying gameplay, a storyline that will please long-time fans, and an absolutely phenomenal soundtrack. It immediately places itself among the best Sonic games ever made.",Sonic Frontiers is quite a fun game with much content to enjoy. It is a first step that excites us about the franchise's future despite the technical failures it frequently presents.,"Sonic’s open world feels half dead, full of boring activities, tedious bosses and awful graphics. The undeniable potential has been squandered. Well, maybe next time. How often do we say this when talking about Sonic?",,"After decades of miserable failure, Sonic Team has finally made a good 3D Sonic the Hedgehog game, and it’s one of the best open world platformers ever seen.","Transforming a historically linear formula into an open world is not easy, and the Sonic Team is doing it without managing to avoid all the pitfalls that such a change imposes, starting with the repetitiveness of the adventure, a perfectible technique and a camera in difficulty. However, this new Sonic experience blows a breath of fresh air on the saga with its titanic combats, its open-world ""platformer"" approach and its desire to push its own limits, even if it means losing control.",,"Sonic Frontiers is a fascinating game, mostly because of how little it actually feels like the rest of the series. The game’s marketing has called it an “evolution” of the Sonic formula, and that’s certainly accurate, but it’s still hampered by some growing pains. Sublime exploration and intuitive mechanics constantly clash with Sonic Frontiers’ insistence on introducing mandatory mini-games and one-off gimmicks, many of which simply aren’t engaging.","Sonic Frontiers is a strange, yet fun time. The individual levels showcase Sonic at his fast-paced, ring-hoarding best, and some of the overworlds sport rewarding exploration mechanics. The insistence by Sonic Team to jam in minigames that block progress to the story is frustrating to say the least, and some of the larger maps’ designs feel a little haphazard. Overall, though, the weirdness of the story will keep some going just to see, well, where the hell it’s all going. It’s weird how much this doesn’t feel like a Sonic game outside of the individual levels, but this is an interesting direction that Sonic Team has taken their blue blur, and hopefully we will see a continued evolution that coalesces into something great.","Even with all the frustration built up by the game’s technical problems, I found myself unable to truly dislike Frontiers. I found its pacing to be extremely solid, the Cyberspace levels (and their godlike soundtracks) to be fun, and the combat always enjoyable...Sonic fans will adore this game for the risks it takes and the story bits that can be picked up through its side missions. There’s clearly a lot of love and care put into this game, and although some of that should’ve been spent to fix its glaring performance issues, it still holds up as a fun adventure.",,,,"With Sonic Frontiers, SEGA wanted to modernize its license by choosing the open world, which is a great risk. The idea is good but the result is not successful. The world is empty, with no common sense, game mechanics way too redundant, and technically the game is way too dated. We get bored quickly in this Sonic Frontiers who wants to do something new, but never manages to convince. You don't become an open world expert by clapping your hands, right…",,"Imaginative and densely populated but also rather samey and sparse at the same time. Technically iffy, but its lock-on gameplay suits the open world playground. [Issue#22, p.70]","The first step for the future of Sonic: The Hedgehog. Ambitious, brave and fresh ideas and concepts for the Sega mascot, but need to improve his visuals and rethink a few things to be the game that Sonic deserves.",,"Despite the joys offered, Sonic Frontiers is a hot mess of a reinvention that can't commit to its new direction.",,,"There’s something dedicated Sonic fans see in “Frontiers” that others simply don’t, and it’s not just nostalgia.","As frustrating as Sonic Frontiers can be, I can’t say I didn’t enjoy this new, more flexible take on the timeworn series. Sure, the story, while intriguing at times, didn’t do much to keep me hooked aside from some unexpectedly funny deliveries from Sonic (who constantly brushes off lore dumps from other characters by saying he’s either gone through worse or he’s just here to save his friends). What’s more, the game often felt more like a checklist than, well, a game. I completed more minigames than I could count. The list of frustrations goes on. It’s unfortunate to see a Sonic game that tries, and often succeeds, in retreading past foundations and applying them to a different setting. But the highs of fighting the Titans or playing remakes of classic levels can’t justify the frustrations that constantly put stops along the way.",,"Sonic Frontiers marks an ambitious, seismic shift for the series, with a massive open-world adventure that both honors its past and pushes the boundaries of what this franchise can look like moving forward.","Sonic reinvents himself with an experimental adventure that, even with its flaws, shows a solid foundation for future adventures.",Sonic Frontiers really picks up the slack where this franchise started to falter. It’s still a Sonic game at its core and makes sure to stay true to the name even when branching out into other areas unfamiliar to the series.,"With a revelatory open world to zip around and entertaining boss battles alongside the more traditional Cyber Space levels, Sonic Frontiers is the best that Sega’s hedgehog has been for years.",,"Sonic Frontier Unknown is a contradictory work. It breaks the doubts of many people, proves that the combination of Sonic's traditional series and the open world is feasible. However in the same time, the combination is still rough. Sonic Frontier Unknown has many flaws, but it's still a fun Sonic game, and also pointed out a new direction for the running blue hedgehog.","Sonic returns in an inescapable mishmash of strong mechanics and ideas alongside poor execution and empty lifeless ‘open-zones’ that offers little to tie it together. Whilst this could be the start of a brand new revolution for modern Sonic games, Frontiers still feels like a beta test, and one that fans shouldn’t have to playtest for Sonic Team to work out what to do next.","It's not a home run, but Sonic Frontiers does so much of the things that really matter so well that it is easily the most fun 3D Sonic has been in years – maybe even decades – and a genuinely fun and engaging game on its own merits.","This has been one enjoyable ride and it is great to see how well Sonic has fared in his latest outing. Exploration is fun, running around an island and going from grind rail to grind rail. The variety of challenges and collectibles are balanced, and combat has evolved via the new Cyloop ability, although this does get a little repetitive by the end of the game. There is never really a dull moment to be had, and there is plenty of content to power through. This is a game that every Sonic fan needs to play. Hopefully Sonic Team and SEGA follow up with a direct sequel as they have the formula nailed just right.",Sonic Frontiers is far from perfection but still the best and most fun Sonic 3D ever.,"An imperfect yet amusing title, capable of showing us the potential face of the hedgehog's future.",Sonic Frontiers is the best Sonic 3D game to date.,,,"Sonic Team has never been afraid to take risks and Sonic Frontiers is a good example of one that has paid off. There are some areas where it is lacking, such as the minimal number of Cyberspace settings and the Titan fights, but Sonic Frontiers is the best 3D Sonic games in a long time, with its open-world foundation offering something for the series to build on in years to come.",,"Finally, after almost 25years of half measures and mostly mediocre titles, Sonic has finally reached the 3D levels of gameplay it needed to reach. Yes, the pop in is absolutely inexcusable and the ancient gatekeeping grindy methods damage the flow of the game for no reason, but a wonderfully built base exists here, with a highly entertaining adventure in wonderfully melancholic world and a surprisingly well founded story, thankfully clean of Sonic’s annoying 3rd tier friends!",,"Sonic Frontiers has finally figured out how to evolve the franchise in the 3D era, with gameplay mechanics that break away from the usual on-rails hyper-velocity of past editions, ironically giving a sense of speed like very few video games have managed. It's fun, deep and full of little surprises. You can shout to the heavens: Sonic is back! But don't shout too far, or the game won't render.",,,"Sonic Frontiers is a delightfully weird and experimental evolution of the Sonic games so many of us grew up with. Its series of open-world islands are filled with so much variety and pieces of Sonic history, from classic platforming stages to silly minigames, that they’re enjoyable to explore even when awful graphical pop-in is a constant hedgehog spine in your side. Some of the new stuff Frontiers tries out, like the smart toggling between 2D and 3D perspectives out in the open world or the Cyber Space levels, are fantastic ways to pack as much Sonic goodness as possible into one package, while others – especially combat – are uninteresting experiments gone wrong. Still, I largely enjoyed my time running around in Frontiers, making it feel like a very promising first attempt at what could be a bright new era for Sonic and friends.","Sonic Frontiers is a strange experiment that somehow worked, the mix of open world game mechanics with 3D Sonic gameplay worked out unexpectedly well, with just a little more polish on this idea SEGA could possibly have something really special here.",,"Sonic Frontiers is a solid core experience stretched far too thin, proving that sometimes more is less.",,,"The game sticks the landing in many ways that matter, but these flaws are hard to ignore as its runtime carries on and you start bumping up against them more often. Sonic Frontiers falls short of a home run, but is still a successful step in the right direction from a studio that has demonstrably stumbled trying to do so before.","Sonic Frontiers wrangles with a muddled plot and messy technical performance, but the innovation and sheer ambition make it a joy to sprint through.","Sonic Frontiers was definitely a risk, but SEGA and Sonic Team are no strangers to rolling the dice and operating on pure ambition. If we are honest with ourselves, for too long, Sonic has come up short on the execution. But this time the iconic speedster has truly delivered. Open world games might be a dime a dozen, and they have not reinvented the wheel here. Instead, they've successfully transported Sonic to an intriguing new world that is a pleasure to explore, while maintaining some retro flare and an engaging story that will make fans happy. Put simply, Sonic Frontiers is the best 3D Sonic game ever made, and a fantastic step in the right direction that bodes very well for the future of everybody's favourite blue hedgehog.",,"Sonic's new open worlds prove delightfully engaging and imaginative, despite lacking polish and sloppy fixed-camera ""cyberspace"" levels.",,"Sonic Frontiers has given me good moments that I haven't had in a long time with our blue hedgehog. Many will wonder if being open world was a success, and the answer is yes. It is a very fun and intuitive game in which we will be busy with all the challenges it offers. Watching Sonic take on enemies, especially the big ones, is very satisfying. It is not a perfect game on a visual level but it is a necessary game in our lives.",,"Sonic Frontiers will be unable to return Sonic to the videogame Olympus, but it's not like it needs to. After all, the hedgehog has already transcended as a cultural icon in other fields of entertainment. What it does do is restore dignity to a franchise that went from the top to embarrassment. It's refreshing to try a Sonic that evokes the best moments of Sonic Adventure to remind us that SEGA's hedgehog is a gaming icon for a reason.","An experience that is half convincing: on the one hand the open world mechanics don't work very well, on the other hand the classic levels are a lot of fun.","If Sonic Frontiers offers a rather simplistic open world in its conception, it is nevertheless a condensed action, fluidity and dynamism. It's a real pleasure to explore the different islands while sprinting or using the springs and other springboards to go higher and higher. Despite a somewhat redundant scenario and some ergonomic issues, this new title from SEGA is perfect to try 100% without ever getting bored thanks to the fights offering various patterns and mini-games allowing to unlock the zones. In short, an ideal adventure and platform game for the end of the year whether you are a fan of the blue hedgehog or not.","Though it’s rough around the edges, Sonic Frontiers is the best 3D Sonic game in years. This first attempt at the open-zone concept is an admirable effort, and I can’t wait to see how Sonic Team iterates on this formula in future entries, but it’s obvious this is not the formula’s final form. For now, Sonic Frontiers stands as a solid first foray into a brave new world for Sega’s speedy mascot.",,,"Sonic Frontiers may not be the best game released this year, but it is one of the best 3D Sonic titles released in recent memory and should not be missed by fans of the series.","Branded by many as an announced disaster, Sonic Frontiers proves instead to be a chapter full of content and a lot of fun. It is not free from technical problems, however less heavy than one could imagine, but it represents the ideal bridge between the past and the future of the famous SEGA mascot.",,,,,,,,"Sonic Frontiers is nice, but gives the impression of an early access title, looking like a technical demo or a potpourri full of ideas from other licenses, without being perfectly understood.","For the most part, the years haven't been kind to the Blue Blur, but while Frontiers has its problems, it's by far the most enjoyable and ambitious 3D entry in a long time. Its huge open spaces add a refreshing take, and zooming around at high speeds is still fun even after all these years. Hopefully, this is just the beginning of a glorious comeback for everyone's favorite speedy hedgehog.",,Sonic Frontiers is nothing short of a marvel in how it blends together beloved elements from previous games with exciting new twists and turns to create something wholly unique.,"While it may be far from perfect, Sonic Frontiers is a colossal step in the right direction for the future of the neon blue needlemouse. Its issues are more stumbles than falls, with the action and exploration creating a memorable experience for everyone's favourite Hedgehog.","Running around at the speed of sound might be a mantra of the fleet-footed hedgehog, but Sonic Frontiers is at its best when you're given time to simply explore. The music is calming and also solemn at times--even if it knows when to burst into life with a punk rock energy--and there's even a fishing minigame that lets you earn rewards while slowing down the pace a step further. It's easy to fall into a zen-like flow as you traverse each island, rattling off objectives as you happen upon them. There are frustrations that arise and break the flow, whether it's a middling mini-boss or a struggle with Sonic's floaty movement, and it's a big departure from what Sonic fans are used to. I'm fully on board with this new direction, though. Sonic Adventure set the template for the last 24 years of 3D Sonic games, and I'm hopeful Frontiers will do the same for the next generation. It has its flaws, and there's definite room for improvement, but the spiky mascot is finally moving in the right direction.","The fact that there are several difficulty levels and the ability to fine-tune Sonic’s speed, jump height, and even damage recovery as part of the in-game options is not a great sign and is indicative of the mish-mash feel. In the end, the lack of focus and consistency makes Sonic Frontiers feel unfinished - even if playing in the solid 60 frames-per-second performance mode is great for capturing and conveying a sense of speed and scale. But even here there’s so much pop-in that you lose out on a true sense of awe when it comes to the environments and structures born from the mysterious Cyber Space. Another average, but ambitious, outing for the blue hedgehog.",,,,,,"While not outright broken like Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) or Sonic Boom, Sonic Frontiers is a heavily misguided game that muffles good ideas with questionable narrative, technical, and gameplay design decisions. Sonic Team continues to demonstrate that it's not quite sure what to do with the blue blur, taking a wild swing with a game that tries to rival open-world games rather than double down on the strengths of newer titles like Sonic Generations and Sonic Mania, or older successes like the Sonic Adventure series.",,"Sonic Frontiers isn't the disappointment the Sonic Cycle has conditioned us to expect, nor is it the masterpiece Sega fans have been hoping for. It's a super-speedy step in the right direction for the series though, and hopefully lays the foundation for a truly incredible followup.",,"I love Sonic. I can’t overstate this enough. And when you love something the way I love Sonic, you want to see them be the best they can be. Sonic Frontiers is nowhere close to being the best. There is a lot of a really good game, but it’s buried and obscured by frustrating mechanics and baffling design decisions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sonic Frontiers is one of the most fun games I've played all year with a superlative soundtrack. It managed to successfully blend open world elements with Sonic mechanics which is something I didn't think would work, but here we are. Despite the visual issues and some design-related annoyances, I'm looking forward to replaying it and hope it gets some quality of life improvements in future updates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nhl-23,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NHL 23 isn't EA's best year, but it's not the worst either. Stumble actions and loose-puck plays help enhance gameplay, but they remain less than groundbreaking. The addition of IIHF Women's teams is long overdue and quite welcome, and the visual quality in this year over last is a noticeable step up. The expansion of franchise mode is the biggest improvement over last year, though it almost feels like the only mode that was actually worked on, while everything else was simply lifted from NHL 22, unchanged in their function. Disappointing, when there's still plenty of changes that could be made.",,,,,,,,,"As solid as NHL 23 is, it’s hardly a must-play game if you have any previous entries in the series. Given that year(s)-old sports games tend to be pretty inexpensive, that makes it hard to justify buying this one new when you’ll get basically the same experience buying a game from last year or the year before. Don’t get me wrong, you’ll get a very well-made game if you do decide you need all the latest rosters and draft classes, but it’s up to you to decide how badly you need those things.",,"NHL 23 is a good step for the franchise this year, and there needs to be major praise for this. They have been great strides up the ice, but overall I just felt myself wanting something more.",,"Despite the addition of women players in HUT and tweaked mechanics like last-chance puck movements, NHL 23 barely feels it's changed from last year's offering. It's a fun but all too familiar hockey experience.",,"When put up against Madden, NBA 2K, or FIFA, NHL 23 lacks the fundamental quality that makes those titles so fun - the close approximation of the simulation to the sport.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NHL 23 is a vast improvement from last year's entry, featuring better control on the ice, the inclusion of women in HUT, and so much more.",,,,"I’ll even give EA credit. Fifa feels like simulation soccer. Madden feels like simulation football. I know that they’re capable of bigger and better things. But, for now, NHL 23, like all the ones before it, still feels like the black sheep of the family. As if it’s simply incapable of ever feeling like hockey. It’s telling that the worst cover in EA Sports NHL history is tied to the most disappointing game in nearly ten years.",,"With so much good to build on, NHL 23 sadly remains mainly in place. Upgraded rosters, a few visual/audio tweaks and women's national teams are the only notable changes from last year.","NHL 23 is a good if not revolutionary entry into an already commendable simulation sports game. It might not bring anything new to the ice, but it builds on the already pretty precise gameplay and its additions to the current modes make it a very solid entry to the series.",,,"If you have never played NHL (or have a long time ago), getting NHL 23 can be a good idea. It’s a solid game, but not for the veterans of the series.",,"NHL 23 has a few nice additions, but they quickly wear thin. There's nothing of substance, except perhaps yet another year of the same grind in HUT to eventually get a team together that is worthy of competition by the time the next installment skates around. That doesn't seem appealing to me, and unless you've already skipped several years' worth of NHL entries, NHL 23 isn't worth the full asking price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s staggering how little has been done with NHL 23 to differentiate it from last year’s edition. Bugs that should have long ago been quashed remain, Be A Pro continues to be littered with spelling errors and conversations that make no sense, retirement and championship banners in arenas are as far behind as half a decade, and the list goes on. Despite all that, women being integrated into HUT and desperation plays are welcome improvements, as is the overhaul of rink atmosphere. Ultimately, while NHL 23 isn’t a step backward per se, the move forward is so small, so minuscule, that it may as well not have moved at all.",,"The NHL series really needs some competition. Once again, we get improvements in just one game mode while the others gather dust. This year, however, the amount of joy that has been added feels greater than usual.",,,,,,,"If you’re new to the EA SPORTS NHL series, then you’ll have fun with this, there is no denying that. There is a lot of joy to be had if you haven’t touched the series in years, but veteran players will feel significantly shortchanged by this year’s title.",,"NHL 23 is another solid outing of EA Sports Hockey-Series. The gameplay sees minor improvements, that actually makes NHL 23 surpass ist predecessor. But overall the lack of real innovation is missing and therefore experienced players may give this one a pass.","NHL 23 is packed with modes and content that should impress almost any hockey fan, even if some of the technical elements could use a sprucing up. But in a world where NHL 22 exists, there are just far too few additions and improvements to recommend this year's game for returning players.",,,,,,,,,,,"EA’s NHL series feels like it’s slowly distancing itself more and more from the NHL and going more of the FIFA route for a wide variety of hockey around the world. Unlike soccer, though, the best hockey players in the world play in North America for an organized league. The focus on Chel and HUT continue to pull away from a true NHL experience as it feels less and less is incorporated on the NHL side to replicate the sport that people watch. While there are touch-ups to NHL 23, it doesn’t do enough this year to make it feel like an upgrade. Some of the gameplay changes are nice, but on the entire scale with the presentation and feel of the game, it’s mostly the same. The Franchise Mode offering the customization option with the ability to bring in Legacy Teams is a positive, but then modes like Be A Pro are left on the bench once again.","NHL 23 completely revamps crowd reactions and adds women IIHF players and new desperation moves, and it all works splendidly to create not only the best hockey game in a generation -- but one of the best sports games ever.",,"If you’re looking for something that makes you feel closer to the ice than ever before, NHL 23 is going to be your favorite game that you play this year. The electricity that oozes from this title is something that will bring me back to playing it over and over again, even if there are a few nagging problems that need to be addressed very shortly.",,,,,,,,"NHL 23 is an improved and refined version of last year's edition. EA Vancouver had declared that it had taken advantage of all the criticisms raised by its passionate community: so it was. Too bad that to improve the playing experience on ice and offer greater realism, the team sacrificed everything else. It is not enough to have cleaned up the audiovisual sector, improved the AI, retouched the Franchise mode or added the possibility of playing with the IIHF girls: everything else is more or less the same as seen in NHL 22 and given the premises it was it is reasonable to expect more.",,,,,,,,,,,"It’s overdue, but NHL 23 finally looks and feels like it belongs on these beefier consoles. The visual tech upgrade adds stellar reality to the on-ice play, which also benefits from players who are willing to dive for the puck to make a desperate goal or save. It gains new energy from crowds reacting to the action like real crowds would, bringing a definitive audio design that’s best-in-class for stadium effects. Franchise mode customization greatly expands, and seeing women in the fold for the first time feels right – and also overdue. At the same time there are several modes that are outright ignored, including the Be a Pro single-player campaign, and its microtransaction-driven Ultimate Team mode comes with the usual caveats about its predatory, profit-driven nature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fun to play and beautiful to watch, NHL 23 has pretty much everything to be a little gem. Everything except the contents, which are exactly the same of the previous edition: a truly wasted opportunity.",,,,,,"Speaking purely in terms of content, NHL 23 feels more like a (modest) update to NHL 22 than a new chapter in the EA Games series. The changes made to the gameplay and game modes are very limited, and do not significantly affect the overall experience. On the other hand, positive steps forward in graphic/sound, which continues along the lines of last season showing further improvements. Skates on your feet and stick in hand, even with some issues in artificial intelligence, the games are quite fun, but the few innovations make it difficult to justify the purchase for those who already have NHL 22 in their collection. Or rather, they make it justifiable only for those players who focus on those modes that require extensive use of online (Ultimate Team and World of Chel above all).",,,,,,,,,,,"As harsh as this may sound, I’ve lost faith in the NHL franchise. My first game was NHL 93, and although they haven’t all been good, it’s clear that this franchise has settled into an annual loop of delivering the bare minimum. There is zero justification for a full-game price tag when you consider that other games offer free updates larger than what’s on offer as new in the entirety of NHL 23. It’s mind boggling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-diofield-chronicle,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sure enough with its relatively simplistic challenge, brisk battles and unspectacular presentation, The DioField Chronicle will likely struggle to find an audience among the burgeoning throng of armchair generals looking for their next tactical fix. For everyone else however who would like to a dip a toe or two in those genre waters, The DioField Chronicle is the sort of easily accessible, dip-in/dip-out tactical RPG that you need in your life right now.",,,,,,,,,"The DioField Chronicle is a game that I had little trouble sticking with throughout the review process, and could easily see myself going back to in order to finish up the few remaining trophies I have left. The fun gleaned from this strategy title is almost entirely due to the engaging battle system, which while a bit basic compared to other titles, is still a lot of fun to play. It’s not a game that I’d wholeheartedly suggest picking up at full price, but I’d certainly suggest giving it a go after a sale or two.",,,,,,,,,,,,"It hasn’t hit the heights of other strategy RPG contenders, but The DioField Chronicle shows a lot of promise. It’s different, it’s engaging, and it’s got a fast pace that moves from battle to battle.

DioField certainly has the space for it.",,,,,,,,,,,"The Diofield Chronicle is a refreshing take on the tactical battle game where positioning is key. The game offers a wide variety of missions, enemies and teammates, but is slightly let down by a level design that doesn't fully explore the tactical possibilities and a control scheme that doesn't always get the job done. Still, the game has plenty to offer to keep you interested during its 40-some hour campaign.",,"The DioField Chronicle defied my expectations. It’s a solid strategy RPG that offers lots of depth both in gameplay and in the story. The Blue Foxes experience all the ups and downs and tragedy that come with war. The story does a good job of highlighting your place in the conflict. I really enjoyed the payoff that comes with developing the party through research. The combat encounters are challenging without being frustrating. In short, I loved this game. I’m surprised that I loved it! I’m not very good at real-time strategy games but The DioField Chronicle is accessible and great fun.",,,"The DioField Chronicle surpasses every expectation, delivering a great Strategy RPG thanks to its challenging real-time battle system and a rich setting that sustains a great story full of politics and good characters. The few issues are due to the simplistic progression system and the narrative that could be even better, but its a game that deserves the attention of fans of the genre.",,,,"The DioField Chronicle mixes the complexity of a slow-burn political thriller with a deceptively straightforward strategy game. I was pleasantly surprised with where my investment in the world of DioField led me, but pay-off off the battle mechanics does not match the narrative destination.","The DioField Chronicle is interesting as an experiment, but that's about all it has going for it. The combat system is so half-baked that it may as well not exist, and the story is about 20 hours of buildup for a ""buy the sequel"" hook. Since the phenomenal Triangle Strategy came out in the same year, and it handles pretty much all the same ideas much better, it's difficult to recommend DioField. Even if you're curious, it's best to wait for a sale because the full retail price is too steep for what you'll get.",,,,,,I enjoyed my time with The DioField Chronicle and look forward to a sequel if one ever gets produced. Let's just hope that it features more variety in the aspects that its predecessor lacks as well as packs more of a punch challenge-wise.,,,,,,,,"The DioField Chronicle is a decent strategy RPG. Its characters certainly won't live long in the memory, and it can be a an unnecessary grind, but it's well crafted and fairly engaging on the battlefield.","The DioField Chronicle is a very entertaining game thanks to its combat system that feels new, agile, and challenging. It takes the best of an RTS and combines it with passive elements of a strategy RPG, resulting in a demanding experience. It is an enjoyable game to play, but its price at the moment is not the most accessible. Get it when it is on sale.",,,,"From the outset, we cannot welcome the bet launched by The Diofield Chronicle. Carried by divine music and gameplay as ingenious as it is interesting, the Square-Enix game is undeniably generous. Regulars of the genre and lovers of tactical role-playing games risk succumbing to its ""retro"" charm and its various incantations. Rhythmic, pleasant and more surprising than it seems, The Diofield Chronicle struggles to keep up the pace over time. The objectives are repeated, the free phases do not bring much and the staging lacks the energy to widen its audience. Nevertheless, for those who want to discover something other than the usual blockbusters and who is not hermetic to the genre, here is a work that could become cult in a few years or, at least, find its letters of nobility among enthusiasts.",,,,,,,,,,"Diofield has all the elements that should make it a great tactics RPG, but it squanders them on a bland story, simple combat, and unengaging characters. [Issue#20, p.86]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The DioField Chronicle is hard to bring any player the expected experience, except the combat part is quite passable, the other systems either too simple, and the storyline is full of trouble.

With this atypical experiment, the suspicion is that the developer Lancarse has aimed mostly at the casual audience or at least the neophytes of the genre, who through The DioField Chronicle could in fact approach for the first time the evergreen world of strategists and remain trapped in it. All the others will still be able to let themselves be carried away by an intriguing narrative system and an incredibly rich mythology. With the right precautions to the playful formula, The DioField Chronicle could become the starting point on which to build a valid and innovative series.","The Diofield Chronicle is a low-stakes bet from Square Enix and Lancarse: a new IP that tries something new in a very conservative genre.

However, those looking for something more in terms of strategy, will not be satisfied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The DioField Chronicle is an interesting gamble that puts a different spin on strategy games. With a dense story, covering many characters and plots, it will be a game for lovers of medieval works. A unique game system in the genre, whose levels won't make things easy, but we'll know how to get around it if we have a good strategy. It has a fairly deep system and will keep us playing for a long time.",,"We found The DioField Chronicle to be a fresh, interesting and entertaining strategy game.

We are talking about a game that genre enthusiasts will want to try.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The DioField Chronicle establishes a decent framework for a fresh new strategy franchise with a solid, streamlined control scheme, but it's not quite fleshed out enough to keep gameplay interesting until the end. The lack of a more dynamic story and a flat presentation don’t help either.

Hopefully it will do well enough to get a sequel that can realize its full potential.",,,"The DioField Chronicle's interesting mix of strategy and tactics just barely keeps afloat a bloated package of repetition, achingly dull characters, and eye-rolling writing.",,,"While the home base aspect of the game is underdeveloped, the combat at the core of The DioField Chronicle is a breath of fresh air. Paired with a story steeped in intrigue and drama, The DioField Chronicle will likely satisfy fans of the genre while possibly charting a new path for it in the future.","The Diofield Chronicles has a solid foundation of mechanics that is hampered greatly by its poor balancing of difficulty, a cast of forgettable characters and a world that failed to draw me in with its lackluster presentation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While the ending is fitting in wrapping up this story, it feels presumptuous that it’s clearly pushing for a sequel, especially as some aspects of The DioField Chronicle feel underdeveloped. I think there’s still potential for this to become a series, but any sequel would need to go far above and beyond what’s here in the first entry. As much as that statement sounds like it’s looking ahead, it also indicates my feelings. The vast potential is still there, but it’s as yet unrealized, and the battle is far from won. The DioField Chronicle joins the vaunted Square Enix SRPG canon, yet it’s only just there.","Luckily, a solid cast of characters keeps things interesting long enough to continue to enjoy the game’s addicting combat. There’s enough good in the battle system for fans of the genre to get plenty of enjoyment out of it, but the formulaic gameplay loop and bland story keep this from being a true gem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sum of its parts is worth it, but if you are a fan either of mystery games or shmup, the game doesn't sustain itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The only issue we had with Yurukill was that it never felt like it went far enough. It's a compelling tale and it moves at a brisk pace, but it lacks the malicious edge of a Danganronpa or the brain-breaking narrative of a Zero Escape.

It’s a good visual novel with an interesting story and an intriguing cast, but misses the mark in the puzzle/shoot’em up sections. The end result is a game with no balance, interesting for those looking for a visual novel with an intriguing story, to be avoided by those who want to enjoy an exciting gameplay experience.",,,"I really enjoyed my time with Yurukill. It brings together two very different genres and presents a satisfying version of each. If those two sides elevated each other, we could have been looking at a terrific game. Instead, however, those sides mostly just sit alongside each other, feeling like a strange marriage that doesn’t entirely make sense.

With this sort of creativity, it’s exciting to see what We Create Stuff comes up with next. But until then, if you’re brave – and clever – enough, you’d be wise to throw yourself into In Sound Mind.",In Sound Mind might lack the scare factor but it is an unsettling experience throughout that will undoubtedly appeal to fans of psychological horrors.,"We Create Stuff aimed to replicate old school horror in this game, and in that regard, it's a success. The puzzles click together with satisfaction and nothing feels like it's been left behind in the journey from one tape to the next. However, In Sound Mind does draw from other games and so becomes a pastiche, albeit an exciting one with a cracking soundtrack. Plus, a few frame rate dips and crashes took me out of the environments that had been created with such artistic care. What will stick with me is the utter treat it is to scurry round a horror game that isn't afraid of using the entire colour wheel, subverting conventions of what scary can be, and for that I give In Sound Mind a lot of credit.",,,,,,,,,,,,"In Sound Mind is a psychological horror game which borders more on tense than scary, and proves to be a unique look into the minds of struggling individuals. Having each tape/patient provide a different world, with the patient’s inner torment essentially lashing out as the level’s boss, is a unique twist on the genre. The juxtaposition between the monster trying to hurt you, but also expressing its doubt and fears, all while Desmond attempts to calm it and show that he wants to help, felt surprisingly fresh – and gave me much more reason to continue than a simple good versus evil fight would have. A sense of humor, large levels, and a variety of puzzles make In Sound Mind a game worth picking up for those looking for a new twist in an overdone genre.",,,,,"In Sound Mind is frustrating at first but will draw you in with dark themes, bright colors, engaging environments and some pretty awesome gameplay mechanics.

If it were a movie it would sit comfortably with in the B movie section next to Pooka! and The Babadook—which is damn good company, if you ask me.

As a game though, it simply doesn’t have the depth of mechanics to hold you through its 5-6 hour runtime. Sporting awful combat and stealth sequences, boring level design and inconsistent presentation, In Sound Mind activates too few of the adrenaline-controlling brain areas. Instead, it peaked some interest which slowly faded out the longer I played.

It's a masterful way to end off this set of games and for fans of horror media, add this to your library.",,,,,,,,"The Devil in Me may not redefine the series, but it's the first title from Supermassive Games where it actually shows that the developer is trying to improve the recipe.",,,,,,"The final title in the first season of this anthology is a mediocre experience worth trying, but one you'll probably only feel the need to go through once.",,"If you’re a true crime fan, this is going to be the one for you, while also showing you the dangers of letting a true crime obsession go too far. Sometimes, I guess we all need a reminder that going to an exact replica of a place where gruesome murders happened is a terrible idea, even if it is in the name of ‘art’.",,,,,,,Atmospheric killer hotel with likeable characters and sensible innovations. It is a pity that the introduction and conclusion were artificially lengthened.,,"The formula used in The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil in Me clearly has not yet reached its final development. These games are definitely on the right track, offering us long hours of entertainment, horror at times, and above all, replayability.",,,,,,,"Horror games, at their very core, are all about the fear factor. Developer Supermassive Games did a fantastic job of sustaining the unpleasantness in certain sequences, but couldn’t maintain it for the entire length of the game. I come away from The Devil in Me with a new-found fear of seeing button prompts pop up at every available opportunity. That being said, there’s still a lot to like about this game, particularly if you’re a fan of the previous instalments. I particularly enjoyed the different modes available. There’s a single-player mode which offers different perspectives, as well as a multiplayer mode if you’re not feeling particularly brave that day.",,,,,Supermassive Games successfully concludes the first season of The Dark Pictures Anthology on a thundering note. Powerful performances from a diverse cast of characters and an extremely interesting premise based off of real-life serial killer H.H. Holmes allows The Devil In Me to outshine its predecessors in just about every way.,,,,,,,,"The Devil in Me often subverts your expectations in such a way that diminishes player agency and makes your own choices feel arbitrary. Although its added gameplay features make for a more interactive experience, they hardly break the mold and were poorly executed. Technical issues tarnished the experience overall. The game still relies heavily on QTE-based survival mechanics and does little to set itself apart from its predecessors. What had the potential to be a truly horrific conclusion to The Dark Pictures Anthology amounts to little more than a lackluster thriller with a predictable narrative that opts for shock value and jumpscares over quality.","After a slow start to the series, The Devil in Me is a satisfying end to The Dark Pictures’ first season with its fascinating setting and improved gameplay leaving me excited for the second season.",,,"The Devil in Me served as a pretty poor ending for the first ""season"" of The Dark Pictures Anthology. Mobility mechanics and inventory management were fine additions, but they did little to elevate the game and mostly made it apparent that somewhat basic things like that were absent from previous installments. The next Dark Pictures game awaits regardless of the pitfalls of this one, however, so hopefully, Season 2 will be off to a better start than the end of Season 1.",,"The game feels like a regression from Supermassive's previous work. The Quarry was a refreshing return to form for Supermassive, but The Devil in Me and the overall lackluster quality of the rest of The Dark Pictures Anthology make me think that this IP may be out of ideas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Devil in Me brings a very uneven first season of The Dark Pictures Anthology to a close, and I’m left a little ambivalent from the experience. I enjoyed all four of these games to some extent, and I’m curious as to what they’ll do with the next game, Directive 8020. But it’s clear after playing The Devil in Me that Supermassive needs to give these games a little more breathing room. While it’s certainly impressive that they’ve maintained a yearly release schedule for the Anthology, games like The Quarry show that these experiences could be made so much more. I genuinely hope that The Dark Pictures one day become truly great horror games rather than just novelties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Devil in Me disappoints as the finale of The Dark Pictures anthology's first season and proves that Supermassive Games still can't successfully replicate the success of Until Dawn. The gameplay model is now seven years old and needs a major overhaul. Without it the second season may be just as average.,,,,,"If you’ve played a Dark Picture Anthology game, you know what to expect with The Devil in Me. This one ups the ante when it comes to gameplay, but as I’ve pointed out, the new gameplay mechanics aren’t always welcoming, but for the most part, they are an improvement. Other than the change in gameplay, the game plays very similar to the other Dark Pictures games. Whether the story is good or not, or characters are interesting or boring is all left up to opinion for the most part. I’d say that The Devil in Me is about mid-range when compared to the rest of the series. Honestly, from the beginning it seems like the best one, but then the story starts to drag toward the end and it suddenly doesn’t seem as good anymore. I do feel it’s better than Man of Medan, but the other problems bring it down to Man of Medan’s level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It looks nice, there’s plenty of single player content, and it boasts a strong roster of characters and tracks. But did we need another game in the series? Could the new content and characters not simply be an expansion to the previous release? Questions we’ll never know the answer to.

elex-ii,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Elex 2 asks a lot of you and only gives so much in return. The game provides several special concepts and attempts, but the team’s resources limit their potential the entire way. As long as you know what Elex 2 has in store, you might find something there for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Even that's ultimately part of the charm of Elex II though, because it was a game made by RPG enthusiasts for RPG enthusiasts, and min-maxing is, ultimately, a big part of this community. Though the game comes across as an impenetrable club members-only experience at times, the creativity and energy behind it is impossible to deny. Frankly, I would rather play something like this, bugs and all, than something overproduced and so safe that it puts me to sleep.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Elex II ignores current game design ethos and rages to its own weird beat. Weird, fun, tough, and unpredictably funny, Elex II is feels like a DIY punk-rock open world game, janky and awesome all at the same time. Steer clear if you insist on perfection in your games, but if you are willing to go for the ride and appreciate the flaws instead of being bothered by them, you’ll find a deep and fun adventure unlike anything else on the market.",,,,,,"When Elex came out in 2017, it filled a niche despite its many issues. Elex 2 is bigger and its world is more dense, but Piranha Bytes hasn't really fixed much of what was wrong about the first game. Janky movement and weak combat top the list. Annoying mechanics and glacial progression are right up there, too. Elex 2 has ambition, I'll give it that. If it pared that ambition with polish, a more coherent narrative and better pacing, Elex 2 might be a more viable alternative to those other RPGs that are getting so much deserved attention.",,"Elex II is an almost overwhelmingly ambitious and content-packed sequel that serves up more lands to explore, more people to interact with, and more choice and consequence to carefully consider. It has unavoidable rough edges in the technical and graphical departments that, for many raised on highly polished triple-AAA titles, won’t be easy to overlook, but in terms of providing freedom and reactivity that makes for truly engaging role-playing opportunities, it is a fun, satisfying package that few titles can measure up to, proving budget isn’t the be-all, end-all for a great RPG experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The interesting game world is worth exploring, thanks in part to the many fun easter eggs and missions you get to choose from. The fact is that it is technically rather messy. For example, the game has quite a bit of screen tearing, frame drops and more. Also, the battles are stiff, making it all feel a bit shaky. If you know how to get past this, then the game is quite nice to play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Elex II is a uniquely ambitious game made by a developer that already focuses on ambitious games, and Piranha Bytes almost stuck the landing. As a title that focuses on the role-playing part of RPGs, it’s rather smartly put together. Magalan isn’t a generic world and the plot builds on familiar concepts to something intriguing. There’s plenty of enjoyment to be found in the package, as it’s completely packed with unique and compelling content. The missteps found on the journey do a ton to hold it back, but it’s nothing a patch or two can’t fix up. Should these get resolved, then this is a title that’s dense and uninviting at first. Those who push past that gruff exterior will find, well, more gruffness, as well as a world that’s interesting to explore and make a true mark upon.",,,,,,,,ELEX 2 ends up delivering a buggy game that occasionally entertains.,,,,"Elex II retains both the best qualities and the worst problems of its predecessor, but it's overall a better game. Still, it's hard to recommend it without qualms to anyone who hasn't played a Piranha Bytes RPG before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The freedom ELEX II allows through the traversal mechanics is something that I have never encountered before in a game like this but will now always think about going forward.,,"Despite some of the weaker elements, everything combines into one to provide an unpolished journey for sure, but one that I was thankful I experienced. Elex 2 is a rather unique game, with some modern touches and presentation attributes – but at the same time if you played this game without knowing anything about it, you could mistake it for something from over 10 years ago. It has a unique charm, and if you are willing to put up with some janky combat and odd glitches, there is certainly an engaging story to follow with exceptional dialogue and choices that really seem to alter the world around you, taking you on a long journey filled with meaningful engagements and a world teeming with character.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"All these pieces come together to make ELEX II’s world a fascinating one to explore and get lost in, so long as you approach it with the right frame of mind. There’s more to discover than you could ever see in one playthrough, but that’s also not really the point—it’s not about checklists and activities that pave the road to 100% completion, but about discovery and adventure. And, yes, the jank is part of that—it’s unwieldy and often frustrating, it’s going to be a deal-breaker for a lot of people, but there’s a certain low-budget charm in the messiness of the game’s combat and pulpy dialogue. Polished to a sheen isn’t always better, and ELEX II is a nice reminder of that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Faster paced gameplay centred around a single worm is a breath of fresh air - and implemented quite well - but it's held back by a stripping away of Worms' most identifiable qualities: turn-based gameplay that emphasised strategy, destructible environments that continually redefined stages, and a never-ending stream of charm that kept matches as entertaining as they were engaging. Worms Rumble resembles its predecessors superficially, while failing to carve out a clear identity by recycling what little content there is in-game ad nauseum. Rumble will almost certainly be updated with new modes over time, but franchise veterans are bound to be disappointed and newcomers are better off waiting until then.",,Plunging into the midst of no-holds-barred battles as your own custom soldier could make you smile on multiple occasions and is another reason to add Worms Rumble to the PlayStation Plus collection.,"Worms Rumble is an interesting try to renew Worms with a bit of hybridation from battle royales, but it lacks depths and, if the game will not be appropriately supported in the future, it may leave a bitter taste both for Worms' and for battle royale' lovers alike.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s fun in bursts of 20-30 minutes or so, but this is the sort of thing you play in between sessions of games you enjoy more.

With a large amount of extra content for players, and a whole new region to explore that feels distinctly different from England, this expansion is a solid one for new and returning players. Just don't expect any major new gameplay changes or features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A decent if uninspired first major DLC pack for Assassin's Creed Valhalla. Its truly brilliant moments are worth playing, and those who enjoyed the core gameplay loop of the main game will be satisfied.

The story is too concerned with political intrigue that isn’t that intriguing, the landscape is mostly barren greenery that’s unexciting to traverse, and the overall game hardly hovers above the average baseline it rests upon, just to name a few of the overlapping problems. But Wrath of the Druids does leapfrog the base experience because of its relative focus that organically slices off the astounding amount of bloat inherent to a game that large.

But those on PC and PlayStation 4 may find it more difficult justifying spending even $20 on such a brief puzzle game.",,,,"Maquette - and the development team - deserve better. There's some real talent evident in the unique, interesting, contemplative and rewarding puzzle design here, and that kind of quality occurs less and less frequently in this vapid and action-obsessed industry. The development team also know how to write interesting and emotionally engaging narratives - we don't see stories about love told with this kind of sincerity anywhere near often enough. Unfortunately, the one and only problem that the game has is also the thing that almost breaks it; the two elements that the entire experience relies on are at near-complete odds with one another.","Maquette is a puzzle game with a lot of silent walking, self-reflection, and a deep storyline.

Maquette chooses to be uncompromising in its vision and message, and it challenges players both mentally and emotionally as a result, with a suitable payoff waiting for those willing to sink in the hours to get there.",,,,"Maquette’s central mechanic is brilliant and leads to some cool (but also repetitive) puzzles. The game itself is pretty rough around the edges though and I felt the developers could have squeezed so much more from this great concept. [05/2021, p.60]",,,,,"Maquette is colorful and sometimes quite smart, but the trial and error gameplay is frustrating.","It’s not always a perfect combination. A few of the latter puzzles feel needlessly complicated, requiring you to place the objects at pixel-perfect angles to trigger the next area. But that doesn’t take away from how remarkable the game is. Like Portal before it, Maquette redefines what puzzle games are capable of, and I don’t think I’ll be forgetting about these characters any time soon.",,"Definitely give Maquette a try if you like puzzle games, but be aware that you’re likely to come up against numerous brick walls as you vie to reach its conclusion. The earlier puzzles are truly satisfying to crack but they quickly lose their charm, while later conundrums might leave you scratching your head in frustration. What doesn’t lose its charm, though, is the small yet beautiful narrative that you’ll want to savour every moment of. It’s just a shame there isn’t more of it.",,,"The stunning world Graceful Decay has built in Maquette is perpetually gorgeous and dream-like throughout its short time, never failing to blind you with its beauty. The puzzles utilise size manipulation to provide you with a satisfying mix of challenges, too.",,,"Maquette it's an interesting proposal, both in terms of gameplay (recursive worlds), and the way it tells the tale of a relationship. It's not perfect (frame rate issues, some puzzle design maybe are too complex and abstract...), but the precious message and the mark it will leave are, simply, magnificent.","Maybe there’s no healthy way to insulate yourself from heartbreak, but there’s still beauty in the retrospective. Maquette casts a rosy lens on a love story softened by time’s eventual passage. It’s an important lesson, that the sorrow of love lost can be soothed and sanded down by the steady movement of the clock. The story’s frequent puzzle breaks mean that you’re eased into the worst of it. You’re given a long runway before the inevitable climax, which might be a blessing in itself. Even if a reflective journey through a complex relationship doesn’t appeal to you, the intricate world and it’s fascinating puzzles will surely have you hooked.",,,,,,,,,"Maquette starts off strong, but halfway through the story we forgot why the gameplay and the story were such a great match. Maquette offers a fun way to play with scale and is therefor still worth the try.",,,,,,,,,Maquette has something special. It delicately tells a very credible story with some clever puzzles mechanics and brilliant emotional moments - thanks to the performance of Bryce Dallas Howard ans Seth Gabel. But it's flawed by some painful pacing issues and some other problems that prevent it from being truly memorable.,,,,"Maquette is a fascinating puzzle game with a unique central mechanic. This leads to some super clever puzzles that will really test your grey matter. However, we can't help but feel that the concept's potential isn't quite fulfilled. Similarly, the story is pretty unique among games, but the execution just isn't quite there. Overall, it's an enjoyable experience that puzzle lovers should sample — just don't expect it to change the world.",,,,"A love story told through a first person puzzle game that delights in playing with scale and recursive environments, even if its conundrums eventually feel a little undercooked.","In the end, Maquette is a fair and unique experience, even if tainted by some flaws.","The puzzles compel, while the narrative stalls, and there is something worthy in that mismatch. I only wish that breakup at its core yielded something worth holding on to.",,"Maquette has its issues, but is still a solid experience. The grievances I have can be fixed if the studio has the manpower and time to do so. If you’re looking specifically for puzzle games there are others I would recommend before this. But it’s free for PS Plus members for March 2021, and it’s hard to say no to free.",,"Maquette is an intense love story mixed with Esher-esque puzzles. Short, not perfect but original and sweet.",,,,,,"Maquette is a good puzzle game that does not get rid of some inconsistencies, its control and the design of some of its puzzles have room for improvement, as well as the integration of its narrative with the playable mechanics. However, he knows how to keep his puzzles fresh faithful to his idea of perspective management until the end of the adventure, managing to evoke emotions in the player through the artistic and sound section of him. I have really enjoyed the 3-4 hours that the title lasts, being a very pleasant experience which, despite its possible shortcomings, I have to recommend to those who like the puzzle genre and the more purely narrative adventures.",,"What comes as a result is a sense of distraction, above all. Almost a sense that Maquette suffered from too much budget, from misplaced attention to themes or scale. The first half - three hours or so - is a brilliant success, a gorgeous, ingenious, delicately poised construction of spaghetti-brain recursion and latent atmosphere. The time you spend there, submerged deep in focus, is wonderful. The rest is interference.",,,,"The magical world of Maquette never wears off, but the relationship fades. And so the world does shift with it, the colorful fantasy turning gray, the maquette tattered and broken. (At least, for Michael.) This isn’t necessarily a spoiler; it’s something that’s clear from the beginning, an overtone that shades the whole story, even in its happiest moments. The player knows from the beginning that the relationship — no matter how good and perfect it seems — eventually ends.",,,"Maquette is interesting and has some really good ideas, although there are many ups and downs throughout it. If you like the genre, make sure you check it out.",,"Maquette is a great puzzle game that uses perspective and out of the box thinking very well. The story of Michael and Kenzie is neatly entwined within these puzzle, adding heart and soul to the game as you make your way through the world, big and small.","Maquette is a beautiful game with a compelling narrative that is a perfect weekend experience. Across its four-hour runtime, I was able to feel emotionally invested in this relationship as I begged to see it through until the end. The puzzles hinder progression, but the lack of interaction with the environment limits any additional playthroughs or unique playing experiences.",,,"While it misses the chance to transcend the sum of its parts, Maquette tells a beautifully relatable story with a gorgeous presentation, accompanied by a clever and unique size-bending puzzler.",,An interesting mix between a puzzle game and a narrative adventure.,"Certainly an imperfect production, Maquette remains an indie that lovers of the genre would not be hurt to try, perhaps taking advantage of the current inclusion in the PlayStation Plus lineup (or future discounts, for PC users).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you can pick up Maquette from free as March 2021’s PlayStation Plus title, it’s difficult to argue against. But if you’re looking to pay full price for this 3-hour puzzler, you’re money’s better spent elsewhere.",,,"Maquette's core concept of puzzle solving in recursive environments is undeniably neat. But despite the handful of wow moments it enables, developer Graceful Decay ends up squandering much of the idea's potential due to pacing issues and rough edges.","Aesthetically pleasing 3D puzzle game with smart mechanics, embedded in a love story. It doesn’t reach its full potential, though.",,,"The first half of Maquette is close to flawless, with its puzzles and narrative sharing a symbiotic relationship that whilst brilliant, makes the flaws of the second half glaringly obvious. Full of character, ambition and love, Maquette is a unique experience. If you enjoy story-driven games, Maquette is a must. Maquette is a wondrous exploration of human relationships and packs an emotional weight that will leave a lasting impression on its players and it'll be interesting to see what Graceful Decay does next.",,"Maquette is an intriguing recursive puzzle game that offers a variety of logical challenges, certainly ingenious but sometimes difficult to solve.",,"When Maquette is firing on all cylinders, it is a beautiful journey through a series of ever-larger environments, and Maquette’s love story is poignant and a little heartbreaking. Sadly, my interactions with the puzzles were also full of heartbreak. While Maquette has some missteps, I look back fondly on my time with it. Much like a real-life romance, my affection for this game is complicated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Maquette never quite delivers that sense of mind-boggling euphoria you might expect. Finicky mechanics sometimes get in the way, and it would help if there were more rewards for experimentation. That said, it’s still a fascinating premise that’s fleshed out in ways that keep pushing you to think outside the box. Paired with a love story that feels personal and authentic, it’s both intellectually and emotionally worth exploring.",,,"A unique, thoughtful narrative puzzler with a mind-bending recursive twist that succeeds by focusing more on evoking its themes than unpacking them. Some minor lapses in polish aside it's a short, sharp hit of emotion and wonder that should be on every indie puzzler fan's list.",,,,,"Maquette is a realistic, empathetic portrayal of two people falling in love and what comes next. If it was only that, it would make a great audio drama, or with some tweaking, a touching movie or book. But it's a game, and despite the awe-inspiring first impression it delivers, the cagey puzzle logic can leave you more hopeless than the central pair's prospects for longevity.","Overall, Maquette is a solid and unique puzzle game with a sentimental, well-performed story that may hit a little too close to home for some, while maybe providing some closure for others. If only the developer found a way to intertwine the puzzles and the story together to feel more complete.",,,,,,,"Maquette is beautifully crafted, and I was really hoping to get to know Kenzie and Michael better over the course of time. However, superb voice acting, a great soundtrack, and some interesting design ideas were just not enough. The gameplay regrettably fails to stand up to its true potential while the rules of the game are frequently broken. And after just two or three hours, it is all over. [Issue#310]",,,,,"This playful space is engaging and sequesters some neat solutions but we wish Maquette thought more outside the box and followed its own fun. [Issue#187, p.86]",,,,,"As a drama about two people falling in and out of love, the script is an amalgam of every relationship ever presented on television and in film, so it is easily relatable if rather trite. If you like abstract puzzles framed around a grounded narrative, then Maquette does offer some value but I don’t see it leaving any long-lasting impressions.",,,"Perhaps the style made more sense when the game’s creative director Lemoore conceived Maquette back in the early 2010s, but the world is a different place now, and the game, despite its clear technical achievements, feels like a time capsule.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, the sides of it that shine are absolutely stunning. Not to mention that if you are a fan of the series, it will probably blow your mind.",,,"Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles is an experience that never overstays its welcome. While the map may be simplistic and outdated, the combat, visuals, voice acting, and story more than make up for anything the game lacks. New and old fans will find something to enjoy here, while the versus mode will keep players engaged long after the credits roll.",,,,,,,,"Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles is a title made for fans full of fan service. The simple, but fun combat makes it one of the best anime games of recent years, but it still has a couple of problems.",,,"Demon Slayer – Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles is a solid first attempt at bringing this anime to a game format for current generation consoles. What SEGA and CyberConnect2 need to figure out is how to balance bringing the story into the next one while opening the world and trusting the player a bit more. I want to play and explore the anime, I don’t want to just watch it through my PlayStation 5. I have VUDU and HBO Max for the latter.",,,"This is going to sound like a backhanded compliment, but it's not intended as such: Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles could have been so much worse. An anime that has become this celebrated was always going to deserve more than a copy/paste paint-by-numbers arena brawler, and the team at CyberConnect2 have done well with what I'm sure were significant limitations. There's respect there, and an understanding that Demon Slayer is more than a mindless series of fights, even if the gameplay system creaks with age and having been used for far too many other anime tie-ins. Mind you, if nothing else, being able to tear demons a new one with Nezuko has been something I've been looking forward to from day one with this anime, and if nothing else, CyberConnect2 delivered that.","The Hinokami Chronicles is an enjoyable adaptation of the Demon Slayer anime, but it never tries to be anything greater. The combat is fun, fast-paced, and lets the player wield the explosive moves of the Demon Slayer Corps in a visually exciting way, but the story mode that makes up the bulk of the single-player content is stretched too thin. Fans of the anime should enjoy The Hinokami Chronicles, but it won't have much appeal to those who aren't already familiar with the series.",,,,,,"Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles is another decent brawler adaptation that sort of asks you to already have a bit of background on the source material to truly enjoy it. In that sense, it joins a very crowded space of many other anime games before it, and many of you out there know where you stand on these.",,"If you really want to try out Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, just wait for the next sale. At this state the feels more like a prototype. CyberConnect2 can certainly do better.",,,,"Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles is a great anime-based fighting game that’s only going to get better. Its story mode is a lot of fun to play through, thanks to the quality of the source material and CyberConnects2’s refined battle system that’s easy to pick up yet rewarding to master. Factor in the beautiful visuals and a decent amount of side content to engage in, and you have one of the best videogame adaptations of an anime we’ve ever had the pleasure of playing. If you’re a fan of the franchise, consider this a must-have. And even if you’re not, you might want to give it a go.",,,,,"Demon Slayer is true to its source material, closely following the initial story arc and Mugen Train. The single-player story is short and never really taxes the player. The areas in between fights aren't inviting to explore as movement is slow and tasks obligatory. The roster of characters for online fights is small and partly locked behind the single-player storyline. In multiplayer, the fighting system blossoms, but it would have been great if the range of abilities was better used throughout the game.",,"The exploration sections are somewhat dull, the fighters are interchangeable, and the story is told in a separate menu, but the parts that need to work, do. Combat is crazy, fast, and deeply satisfying. Whether this is your first 3D arena fighter or your fifteenth, The Hinokami Chronicles are a lot of fun.",,,,,,,,"Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles is basically a game for the fans. Do you want to pick your favorite character and beat up your other characters? Or do you want to see scenes from the original story re-created in beautiful 3D? However, that is about all it offers. It's beautiful, plays well, accurately captures the source material, and that is the beginning and end. If you're curious about the uber-popular franchise, it's probably best to watch the anime or read the manga before diving in.",,,"Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles is a loving recreation of the first leg of Tanjiro and Nezuko's journey. It might not push the envelope in any meaningful way, but I can guarantee that this will satiate Demon Slayer fans and maybe even provide some entertainment for newcomers. It delivers on exactly what's promised, and I think that is what most people will want out of The Hinokami Chronicles.","A middling exploration game with subpar fighting mechanics, it’ll be harder to enjoy Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles if you’re not already a fan.",,,,,,"Demon Slayer: The Hikonami Chronicles is a bit lacking where it had everything to succeed: with a faithful representation of the characters of the anime, it does not go further, with an empty environment, dated textures and a technique that smacks of old, even on next-gen consoles, not to mention a cruel and glaring lack of variety in the action. But he has for him a model more than faithful to the anime and a combat system as simple as it is effective, which will appeal to the greatest number, despite a weak roster and great confusion in the action when several people are fighting at the same time. A game of average quality after all, for fans and for those who want to easily take their eyes off between combos.",,,,"Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles is carried by its fantastic presentation, which expertly captures the look and feel of the anime. Bombastic boss fights and some stunning cutscenes are enough to sell the otherwise short-lived story mode, but outside of that, this is a rather barebones package. Battles can be flashy and fun, but the combat system doesn't have the necessary depth to hook anyone who isn't a Demon Slayer super fan. If this is just the first step in a new series from CyberConnect2, then it's a solid debut that'll no doubt form the basis for a much meatier sequel.",,,,,"The confrontations underlined by visual effects of any beauty do honor to the sequences passed to the posterity of the animated series. Yet the lack of creativity in anything related to directing turns a supposedly epic and touching story mode into a simple succession of fights interspersed with phases of exploration of no real interest. As for multiplayer, Versus mode is content to show presence. Ultimately, the title of CyberConnect2 is to advise fans, and only fans of the work of Koyoharu Gotōge.",,,,"Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles is a perfect way to relive the Kamado siblings' adventure, despite knowing what's around every corner. And for new fans, it is a great chance to experience the series from the get-go. While its VS mode may not be for everyone, the main story itself is enough to feed anyone's appetite, and its gorgeous visuals make it a feast for the eyes.",,,,,,,"CyberConnect2 makes a good first attempt taking Kimetsu no Yaiba to videogames, but the game has some flaws.",,,,,,,,,,"The game offers exactly what it promises by presenting a high level of graphical fidelity, beautiful effects, a solid combat system, and a story mode that replicates some of the series’ best moments perfectly. The title also sets the foundations of what can become another successful series. With that said, Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles is a title sure to hit the spot for both the fans of the acclaimed series and those of Arena Fighters in general.",,"Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles features some incredible storytelling moments, but that’s mostly because it’s an exact retelling of the excellent source material. On top of this, you get to experience some of the most significant fights from the series firsthand. However, this comes at the cost of lengthy cutscenes and a game made for fans of anime and not necessarily fans of fighting games.",,,,,,,,"Overall, The Hinokami Chronicles is an enjoyable arena fighter with a really intriguing story. There are moments where the game feels a bit too slow or uninteresting during the exploration moments, but the combat makes up for it. Fans of Demon Slayer will love plaything through The Hinokami Chronicles, and even newcomers to the series will enjoy this well-done fighting game.",,,,"A rather familiar anime fighting game that even though it does not excel in any way, it truly shows CyberConnect2's expertise on the genre.",,,,,"Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles is a fighter that balances depth and accessibility well, but it’s hamstrung by an inconsistent story mode and a slim roster.",,,,"There’s a lot to like about Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles even if it isn’t exactly perfect. It’s a strong first step. The Adventure Mode’s execution and ideas are sound, even if it can feel a bit simple in practice. The Versus mode works well, with characters who feel distinct and have personalities come through. A few more fighters would be appreciated. It certainly looks good. And given a promise of free updates, it seems to have room to grow. In short, it’s enjoyable even if it isn’t perfect yet. And if what is here is the prelude to additional installments, a la the Naruto Ultimate Ninja series, I think it could hint at a bright future for Demon Slayer games.",,"In short, this game feels very much like a stepping stone on the way to a better Demon Slayer game in the future — one with a wider variety of playable characters, more new combat features, and a longer storyline that can afford to cut out filler moments that pad the experience.",,,,,,,,,,"Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles is a fan service game, and it doesn't hide it. If you are a fan of the first hour then you will have no problem to dive into this adventure which mixes combat and narrative phases, all in the enchanting universe of the anime. For the others, the experience will lose a lot of flavor. The story mode is not always well-paced and the Versus mode is clearly not enough on its own. In the end, the game is mainly for fans of Koyoharu Gotōge's work.",,,,,,,,"For fans of the source material or just arena fighters in general, Demon Slayer’s incredible combat and substantial story mode make this a must-play. Sure, the exploration sections may disrupt the pacing somewhat, and the online functionality could use some patching, but these issues don’t detract too much from the stellar foundation which CyberConnect2 has put in place.",,,,,,,,"I walked into Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles without much knowledge on the source material, but the game's approach to its story had some highs and lows. On the one hand, much of the gameplay felt thoroughly average and there wasn't a lot that made me want to keep coming back. However, the presentation did, at the very least, make me interested in the anime. There were a lot of cinematics, maybe too many, but if their purpose was to draw interest to the anime, it did that job well. Not having every fighter out of the box is going to be really frustrating for some players, but if nothing else, experiencing the Demon Slayer story is a pretty fun ride.",,,,"The game does offer fans plenty of quotes, profile pictures, and other knick-knacks to collect throughout its playtime, along with a number of play modes such as Versus and Training Modes to help sharpen your skills, but it feels as if something is missing from the experience that could elevate the first video game outing for Demon Slayer from good to great. If you're a fan of the series, or just want to see some eye-popping visuals with some fast and frantic gameplay, definitely check this one out, especially if you can overlook some of the game's faults along the way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles isn't the game to get me into the genre, I can't deny that it runs well and is mostly fun to play.

The two genres actually complement each other and come together to create a unique and enjoyable hybrid. Its story and setting are pretty over-reliant on well-worn high fantasy elements, but there’s more to the game than the main campaign. Controls on console work about as well as possible, given all the moving pieces inherited from the PC version. Fans of strategy and roleplaying games should find common ground in Spellforce 3: Reforced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It cannot be denied that Spellforce III was launched more than five years ago and the new release while not bad at all shows its age. The good news is that with the DLCs included, the countless patches have been implemented as well, so the Reforced edition offers the best experience.

trek-to-yomi,,,"There's no shortage of reasons to praise Trek to Yomi. The aesthetics, the combat, the soundtrack, not-so-complex puzzles that come up in the second half of the game.

This game „emulates“ an old-style Japanese samurai movie to perfection. While the combat is a bit clunky and the game is not that long, the overall experience is excellent and easy to recommend to anyone interested in such a theme.",,,"Short but ever-so-sweet, Trek to Yomi is a pretty linear affair that respects your time. The combat is nuanced, evolves over time and is entertaining to learn. Small bursts of exploration are rewarded with collectables and upgrades but your main path is never obscured. It's cinematically beautiful and what's done with perspective and setting up each scene is really unique. Trek to Yomi is unlike anything else I have played recently, it's not bloated, pure and I appreciate that a lot.","Trek to Yomi sets out to be classic Kurosawa in videogame form, but it ends up being hampered by clunky gameplay and a convoluted story.",,,,"Trek to Yomi is a beautiful tribute to classic samurái movies, a black and white game with stunning landscapes.

What I would tell you again is not to expect a title as sophisticated in its core mechanics as we have seen in other similar ones, here, the experience is rather focused on its own visual and sound presentation. If you are one of those who love to be consuming indie experiments, it goes without saying that you should try the new Devolver as soon as you have the opportunity. In case you are one of those who was waiting for a game full of action and frenzy, I am afraid that you will not find it here.",,,,,"In its visuals and audio, Trek to Yomi nails its brief to create an Akira Kurosawa-inspired samurai adventure.

Worth a try for the sightseeing perhaps, but don’t expect it to cut deep.","Trek To Yomi is what happens when you’ve got a compelling creative vision, and build a game around it, rather than the other way around. Everything you see, sense and experience in this game contributes to the overall experience, with absolutely no fat or waste. It’s intense, dark, and unforgiving, but it’s also the kind of haunting experience that will stay with you for a long time to come.

Clocking in at only a few hours, this is a brief but ultimately satisfying tale, stitched together by some simple but very effective environmental design, and a combat system that rewards careful play.

Unfortunately, the game has some flaws in its gameplay that keep it from achieving the same 'classic' status as the movies that inspired it.","This one looks way better than it plays. Yes, it’s an absolutely stunning tribute to old Japanese samurai movies but as an action game it’s barely passable.","Trek To Yomi's sound, music and visuals have been developed with love and respect for Japan's rich history, but the gameplay is as captivating as flower arranging.","The attempts to mirror the cinema of Akira Kurosawa work on a visual level but the story and gameplay are so empty and repetitive this barely works as a homage, let alone an engaging game in its own right.","Trek to Yomi is a very beautiful cinematographic work. It doesn't have to pale before the giants who inspired it. Its use of the camera and black and white grain allow it to present us with particularly sumptuous paintings. Add to that some eye-popping fight choreography and you've got a little nugget of artistic mastery. If a game was judged by this, Trek to Yomi would undoubtedly top the charts. But unfortunately, the game is, in comparison, too little pushed in terms of gameplay. Its superfluous choices and its repetitive fights prevent it from expressing his full potential. That said, it is still worth the detour and even more so if you are sensitive to this kind of video game work.","If you want a transporting reverie, a game you can slip into as if you had closed your eyes, then here it is.

The story is engaging, and surprisingly branches with different endings. With a campaign length of around 5 – 7 hours for most players and priced right at $19.99, this is a game that doesn’t overstay its welcome. Repeating sections is not easy with no real save management, and the 2D combat may not appeal to everyone, but it’s hard to ignore the authentic look and feel that such a design choice adds to Trek to Yomi. If you’ve got a day or two to spare, this is one to not overlook.",,,,,"There's Ghost of Tsushima, Sifu and Limbo in this Trek to Yomi! And yet the proposal remains quite singular.

Linked as much to the world of the living as to the land of the dead, the protagonist's journey does not offer particularly surprising narrative implications, but despite this it lets itself be followed and is the backdrop to a playful and audiovisual experience in the name of historical fidelity. Rich in breathtaking views and long shots capable of enhancing an exploratory component not free from imperfections and the beauty of very evocative scenarios, Leonard Menchiari's adventure has been able to intrigue us with his combat system which, while relying on choices that are not always in focus, made you feel like real samurai.

The gameplay of Trek To Yomi is not perfect but the game is not long enough that the player will suffer from the small details.,"Trek to Yomi doesn’t offer anything essential, but it scratches a very specific itch.

It's easy to admire what Flying Wild Hog set you to do with Trek to Yomi. It's an attempt to blend the appeal of the classic samurai film genre with the interactive moodiness of fellow indie games like Playdead's Limbo or Inside. It's partially successful in that regard, but while the ideas underpinning the game are solid, their execution leaves something to be desired. Ultimately, Trek to Yomi could have benefitted from more time studying the blade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Trek to Yomi is a game that lives up to its samurai film inspirations in a way that few others do. Endings that are a little too tidy and a few compromises in game design mean it doesn’t quite leave the impact it should, but the trade off is a game that’s a lot more playable and “fun” than it might otherwise have been—for better or worse. I’d still love to see how Leonard Menchiari’s original, presumably much less accommodating vision might have turned out, but Trek to Yomi is nonetheless an impressive game and a worthy homage to the samurai cinema classics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The trouble is, it wants to be more than that. It wants to be an action-adventure game with an open world. It wants Sherlock to be a fun and interesting player character, but the game makes him drag around a buddy who’s even less helpful than Watson. That said, I am curious to see where Frogwares goes from here.

The invented island of Cordona is a great backdrop for commentary on the late Victorian British Empire in all its excessive and tone-deaf glory, though again, those considerations are secondary. Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is, at heart, a collection of large and small mysteries to be solved, the chance to inhabit the mind of a legendary polymath and play detective with a wide and deep arsenal of tools and toys. Although the series is still bogged down by its fiddly mechanics and the pace can move too slowly for us fidgety gamers, Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is far more ambitious in scope than its series predecessors and may represent a new, high bar for the franchise.",,,,,,,"Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is an exemplary experience for anyone wanting to enjoy time with our eccentric investigator.

On the one hand, it does some great things in terms of the cases and the provided tools to solve those cases. I enjoyed that it never gave me an answer, and I had to arrive at my own conclusions given the evidence I'd found. On the other hand, the game is in a rough technical state with frequent frame rate issues on the PS5, basic animations that feel robotic, an empty open world, and voice acting that can pull you out of the experience at times.

The fact that I was having such an awesome time made dealing with the odd progression issue worth it as I loved taking in all of the sights and stories.",,,"Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is a memorable game, maybe the best produced so far by Frogwares. It is not a classical adventure game, rather an open world Victorian tour de force in the early days of the most famous detective. As such it is not easy, mainly because the developers decided to let players figure out how a detective’s mind works.

These also give the game a very solid lifespan. On the other hand, the proposal proves difficult to measure up on a technical level, with slowdowns, rigid animations and clipping in support. More engaging in its second part, Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One offers progressive dynamism and a commendable conclusion.

The game often stumbles upon the narrative errors of its predecessor, not delving sufficiently into some crucial ideas in the epilogue of the adventure. The meticulous management of clues, deductions and exploration linked to the cases to be solved makes the work a satisfying product for fans of the famous English investigator, as long as you turn a blind eye to a graphic sector that at times is somewhat obsolete.","Way better than Devil's Daughter, Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One has a captivating focus on Sherlock himself, but the open world feels there just for the sake of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"This version of Sherlock feels human, his methods of deduction are satisfying, and his cases are certainly intriguing enough to make aspiring detectives want to solve them all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The entire investigation was worth it and this is an origin worth exploring for any fan of mysteries or the great Sherlock Holmes.,"A fresh and emotional take on the Sherlock Holmes property creates the best narrative in the series yet, but it’s let down by some ambitious design choices.","Despite these issues, it's difficult not to get sucked into Chapter One's web of intrigue.

That said, Cris Tales non-linear story and neat use of time manipulation will still hold a fair amount of allure for genre newbies and stalwarts alike.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Playing Cris Tales is like reading an especially lyrical Paulo Coelho novel, except every ten pages or so, someone slaps it out of your hands. Then you realise some pages are out of order, and you need to flick through the seemingly random pattern before you continue. Also, some pages are so smudged and coffee stained you can’t read them, and a few pages haven’t been translated at all. When Cris Tales works, it’s a wonderful experience, and there’s a great game in here somewhere, but it sabotages itself at every turn. I’ll be keeping a close eye on Dreams Uncorporated - but Cris Tales is a near miss that looks to the future, while clinging too hard to the past.",,,,,,,,,,,"The overall design choices and visual presentation of Cris Tales are one of its stronest suits.

Although fans of retro JRPGs will be able to overlook the constant random battles, lack of auto-save, and the monotonous grind, these aspects will deter gamers who are used to contemporary design elements. The clever use of the time mechanic allows you to be more tactical in your approach to fights; however, this is overshadowed by the sheer volume of encounters and repetitive enemy types. At its core, Cris Tales is a solid JRPG with an interesting twist; however, it sticks to the well-trodden paths of those that came before, creating a disparity between the gameplay and visuals.","Perhaps with a little more consistency and a more extended evolution in the hours, it would have been a much more rounded product. But do not detract from what Cris Tales offers, which is a game that is very worthwhile if you like this kind of adventures, as it stands out from the rest and overflows with personality.","All in all, Cris Tales is unfortunately an unnecessarily conflicting game.

You can feel that the team poured their heart and soul into the game making it a game that will convince everyone willing to try it, even if they usually do not like JRPGs. It has some issues and for some, the visuals might be too colorful or cheerful, but it is an adventure worth playing through.",,,,,"You’ll steadily gain access to new characters throughout your adventure.

The Divine Force is by no means a short game, but it has a way of making the hours fly past so that it never feels like it’s dragging on your time. Yes, the combat is a little unrefined and too pacey for its own good, but it’s still very playable, and totally worth dealing with to enjoy the most exotic JRPG of 2022.","Star Ocean: The Divine Force may be the most solid entry to date. For anyone concerned the series lost its way in Integrity and Faithlessness, those doubts can be put to rest. The only issues - some lackluster characters and a bit too much backtracking - are really ones found throughout the entire series and don't detract much from what makes The Divine Force work so well (great combat, environments that are fun to explore, and entertaining character dynamics). It remains to be seen if Star Ocean: The Divine Force will serve as a watershed moment for the series - but for what it's worth, it's a heck of a good time and one of the best JRPGs to release this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The D.U.M.A offers some fun while traversing and fighting, but outside of that Star Ocean: The Divine Force it's an average JRPG. And that's ok, sometimes this kind of games that are good but not ""masterpiece good"" are just as entertaining as any crazy budget AAA. Sometimes even more.",,,"Your mileage will vary with The Divine Force depending on your expectations. Those looking for another AAA JRPG experience may be left confounded. Character models look too lifeless, the lip syncing is laughable and the world almost feels like it needed a few more months of work to feel alive. Existing fans of Star Ocean are going to be very pleasantly surprised at the robust combat system, the engaging characters and the well told story. It is a like a very good straight to DVD movie, there’s a lot to like but you can see where it lags behind the blockbusters. It is a step in the right direction for the Star Ocean franchise and definitely worth checking out for fans of the genre.","Star Ocean: The Divine Force is both a love letter to what the series once was and a reflection on what its future might look with the power of current gen consoles. While the story and gameplay excite players and bring an unexpected depth, it falls short of its potential thanks to its technical limitations.",,,,"Star Ocean: The Divine Force is a bold and exciting new direction for the series with incredibly fun combat, great characters, and a gripping story. It stumbles more often than it should, but this grand return was more than worth the wait.","I wanted to like Star Ocean: The Divine Force a lot more than I did. It has a lot of interesting ideas and concepts, and I'm a prime target for Star Ocean 2 nostalgia bait. The game didn't have the time or budget to do what it wanted to do, and what we have is a half-baked title that does very little well. The story is dull, the combat is repetitive and poorly balanced, and the unique features fall by the wayside as the game progresses. There are glimmers that something great could have been created, but it isn't the game that we ended up with. It's difficult to recommend The Divine Force to even die-hard JRPG fans, since the game's few strengths are eclipsed by its many flaws. Wait for a sale if you're curious, but otherwise, there are plenty of other better JRPGs to play this year.",,,,,,"Star Ocean: The Divine Force successfully reinvigorates the RPG franchise with an interesting story and characters as well as beautiful settings. D.U.M.A. also makes it fun to zoom around the map and fly through the air on the battlefield. Although the graphics are hit and miss and there are some quality of life improvements needed, Star Ocean: The Divine Force is a JRPG that's definitely worth your time.",,,,"Star Ocean: The Divine Force it will certainly not be the triumphant return that fans hoped for. The game is full of clichés from another time and stereotypical characters, the plot is forgettable and nothing stands out visually. Its super nervous and messy combat system raise the bar however.",,"Star Ocean: The Divine Force is a game with many positives, but offset by just as many negatives. The story is fun, but gets off to a too slow start. The soundtrack is fine, graphically it is mediocre. And so we can go on and on. It is certainly not an unpleasant game, but it could have been better in many ways. However, for fans of the franchise, the game could be well worth playing.",,Star Ocean: The Divine Force is like a comfortable pair of JRPG slippers. If you're in the mood for a Japanese role playing game and you've played all of the good ones then you can rest assured that this one is fine. It's okay. It's comfort food. You know that feeling when you just wish Netflix would make another season of Mindhunter and so you end up watching Criminal Minds? That. Only in space.,,,,"An improvement on the last Star Ocean game but Square Enix’s veteran sci-fi franchise still feels stuck in the past, rather than exploring new frontiers.",,,"There’s still a layer of jankiness the series can’t escape in terms of visuals and tropey writing. But the compelling characters and gameplay mechanics overshadow the rough edges. If this is the last Star Ocean game, Tri-Ace has gone out with a bang.",,"Star Ocean: The Divine Force presents us with a game that may have once been a stellar JRPG title 20 years ago, but those standards just don't hold up in 2022. When compared to its contemporaries, it's just not on the same level, in any way. It's always been a B-Tier Square Enix franchise, but once upon a time, Star Ocean was an essential title. It's a shame that more effort has not gone into modernizing and revitalizing a beloved franchise.","The Divine Force isn’t one of the worst chapters in this long-running JRPG franchise, but it fails to bring the series to a new generation. Despite the good efforts made to revamp the combat system and give more freedom to the players, the game feels like a JRPG of ten years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Rather than aiming for evolution similar to Bandai’s Tales of Arise, tri-Ace and Square Enix went back in time for Star Ocean: The Divine Force. The result is solid, but The Divine Force had the potential to reach even greater heights and establish an identity for the series as a thoughtful reflection on technology and philosophy. If nothing else, at least it proves Star Ocean is still brimming with possibility and deserves another chance, one that will hopefully be more forward-thinking and give the series a chance to shine at last.","I couldn’t be more disappointed in how Star Ocean: The Divine Force turned out, to the point I’d rather go back and replay tri-Ace’s Infinite Undiscovery. You can take solace that The Divine Force is at least better than Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness as there are moments of intrigue, but they’re overshadowed by how severely underwhelming the overall package ended up.",,"Tri-Ace manages to revitalize the series after its last misstep. It’s not the best Star Ocean, but it is the game the franchise needed.",,"Star Ocean: The Divine Force isn't the best JRPG of the year, but it's still full of heart, charm, and an unforgettable adventure. The game might have some lifeless character models and slightly janky AI, but the script brings those characters to life, and the AI is easy to ignore when the rest of the gameplay experience is so refreshing. This is the kind of fresh and fun Star Ocean sequel that long-time fans have deserved.","Star Ocean The Divine Force is a strongly crafted action JRPG that returns the franchise to form, boasting involved upgrading and customization systems alongside a well-thought-out narrative that may not satisfy or intrigue everyone but will compel those entranced by its cutting edges of notion. Moreover, its excellent English voice cast intensifies the emotional weight of several story-heavy scenes and character-bonding moments. Unfortunately, performance and graphical presentation faults and more minor issues damage the overall experience. Although, if you can look past those stumbles, Star Ocean The Divine Force is a must-play entry for all fans of the genre, whether they already are fans of the franchise or not.",,,"While Star Ocean: The Divine Force may not be the most revolutionary, prettiest, or most action-packed JRPG out there, its fantastic cast of characters and generally fun story do quite a bit to make the game’s 40+ hour journey feel quite cozy. Add in the fact that you’re guaranteed to get some uniqueness through its two protagonists having their own bespoke story beats that warrant multiple playthroughs and you’ve got plenty of JRPG to bite into here.",,"Star Ocean: The Divine Force is a far better game than its predecessor at least, and there's a glimmer of greatness in some of its newest features which is sadly obscured by a very outdated vision of the JRPG genre.","At the time of landing on the planet Star Ocean: The Divine Force we had many reservations, mostly due to the disappointment reserved for us by the previous episode. Putting aside the technical sector, which appears unfortunately dated even by the standards of the last generation, the new game packaged by the tri-Ace guys has progressively won our sympathy with an engaging story and suitably rejuvenated gameplay. Not everything convinced us fully, but overall Star Ocean: The Divine Force can be seen as a good starting point for a series that we believed was now doomed, and which on the contrary has strongly shown that it still has something to say.","Star Ocean The Divine Force is a much better effort than Integrity and Faithlessness was, and with it the Star Ocean franchise goes back on track six years after. Tri-Ace revamped the combt system and added new features, now it's up to Square Enix to decide the future of this long lasting series.",,,,,,,,,,"The Divine Force isn’t necessarily a standout in this long-running series, but it is a much more successful effort to bring Star Ocean into the modern age than its predecessor. The revamped battle mechanics do wonders for its previously limited combat system, offering more freedom and flexibility than ever before. The main cast of characters is also charming, even if the world they are exploring and the animations that accompany them are far less captivating. I wish its interface issues were less obnoxious, but even so, The Divine Force at least proves that Square Enix’s sci-fi JRPG certainly deserved another shot.",Star Ocean: The Divine Force is a wonderful treat for fans of the Star Ocean series and JRPGs in general. Players will enjoyably spend tens to hundreds of hours exploring everything this game has to offer.,,,"It isn’t a stretch to say Star Ocean: The Divine Force is the best Star Ocean game in years. The atmosphere is great, even if it can feel a little unsteady sometimes or as though it is borrowing a bit too much from past entries. It’s enjoyable in the ways that matter. Combat is fun. Moving around with D.U.M.A is easy and efficient. Even the Es’owa minigame feels worth your time. It’s generally satisfying, not to mention an encouraging step forward for a series that was clearly in trouble.",,"Star Ocean: The Divine Force is an excellent step forward for the series and should mean plenty to longtime fans. Between the changes to combat and the enhanced exploration abilities, there has never been a better time to sink your teeth into this action RPG series. However, Divine Force doesn’t shy away from delivering a lengthy, epic journey that might wear players down before they ever get to the finish.",,"Star Ocean: The Divine Force will likely win back fans unimpressed with Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness. With its fun cast and expansive narrative, I found the game easy to get invested in, despite the predictably tropey JRPG melodrama. The mobility upgrades and combat overhauls make it the most fun Star Ocean game I have played yet. It’s a shame that the awkward character models, ridiculously small text size and sluggish level up mechanics may prove a roadblock for some. If you’re not already a Star Ocean or JRPG fan, Star Ocean: The Divine Force might not be that easy to get into. However, if you are willing to overlook some of its shortcomings, and want a fantasy action-RPG with a sci-fi twist, it is worth checking out.",,,,"Star Ocean: The Divine Force is a title that becomes interesting the more you play it. It improved a lot compared to Star Ocean Integrity and Faithlessness, with better plot development, mechanics and the most important (it is fun). Although it has some minor problems, it is a good RPG game for fans of the series and those who want to get started in it.",,,"Star Ocean: The Divine Force is a promising new beginning for the saga, thanks to its combat system and the new exploration gameplay ideas that support a great cast and a meaningful story.",,,"This long-running series returns to classic roots with this new entry, but I doubt whether this is a correct choice or not.",,"Star Ocean: The Divine Force is a solid JRPG that straddles two worlds in more ways than one, resulting in a worthwhile yet middling adventure with decent replay potential.","Star Ocean: The Divine Force is yet another Tri-ace jrpg, beautiful in the combat system, while poor in the aesthetic realization of the game world.",,,"Star Ocean: The Divine Force admittedly has a number of issues. A poor interface, a main story that isn’t all that interesting, and certain character designs that just look bad. For me, however, its strengths more than overcame those issues, with a truly charming cast of characters, intense and enjoyable combat, and a novel twist in D.U.M.A. who makes moving around both in and out of combat a joy. It won’t be for everyone, but fans of the series or genre who have spent years waiting for a Star Ocean game worth their time will find this is exactly the sort of B game they don’t make enough of anymore.",,,,,"Star Ocean struggles to keep its interest over the hours, due to an outdated style, a gameplay below the competition, and a nice story, but anecdotal.",,,,"Star Ocean's 25th-anniversary title celebrates its beloved PS2 classic with a spiritual remake, but its adherence to archaic series’ design will ward off new players.",,,"Star Ocean: The Divine Force isn't a bad game. However, it is a game that feels stuck in the past, out of step with the current JRPG renaissance. It fails to adopt the quality of life improvements pioneered in the past generation games, relying too heavily on past precedents, whether or not those precedents ever worked well. Those looking for classic JRPG comfort food will appreciate what The Divine Force has to offer: fast combat, a familiar story, and characters they'll want to get to know. That'll go doubly for those who cut their teeth on PlayStation 2-era JRPG titles, for whom the tedium baked into the game might seem less glaring. Star Ocean: The Divine Force isn't the fully-realized rebirth of the series that it perhaps could have been, but it is at least proof that there is something here worth saving and that tri-Ace deserves to be around long enough for another shot at it.",,"For all its faults, though, Star Ocean: The Divine Force is a relentlessly charming game that reminds me of the best PS2 RPGs. It won’t convert anyone; this is very much a JRPG, albeit a modern one. So if you don’t like the genre, this won’t change your mind. But if you’re looking for a fun romp across the stars, you’ll find The Divine Force to be a journey worth taking.",,,,,,,,,,"Even if far from flawless, Star Ocean: The Divine Force is undoubtedly a return to form for the series by tri-Ace. The game delivers a solid JRPG experience that both fans of the series and newcomers will enjoy, thanks to the best battle system in the series to date, likable characters, and an engaging (though a little slow and fairly predictable) story. Some technical issues and by-the-books game design have to be noted, but for those looking for a traditional JRPG with plenty of heart, Star Ocean: The Divine Force is the game to get.",,,,"My time with Star Ocean: The Divine Force was thoroughly enjoyable, though it started to lose a bit of steam near the end of my 42 hours. The final dungeon(s) do fall into the sadistic teleport dungeon trap that many JRPG areas do, and the primary villain spends far too much time arguing their point with the party, far too many times. By the final battle, I just wanted to see credits, which unfortunately puts me off a replay for quite some time. That said, I’m excited to see Raymond’s side of things, and I can’t wait to swing a sword, rock a mullet, and listen to some trashy synth-heavy prog rock while tackling the extensive post-game. As I’ve said Star Ocean so many times that the words are almost losing all meaning, I’ll simply state this: Star Ocean: The Divine Force is the most Star Ocean that a Star Ocean game can be, and that makes it the best Star Ocean in nearly twenty years.","There’s a solid narrative foundation that can be built upon in The Divine Force. D.U.M.A is an overall delight that provides the best aspects of the narrative as well as the most interesting features in combat and Bohld’or is an excellent antagonist that ties in perfectly to hammer home the intriguing themes. This foundation is weakened by the many gripes with the execution. For a game with the theme of evolution, many of the game’s systems are stuck in the past or never grew to be competent, creating an uneven experience that by the end makes it frustrating to finish.",,"Star Ocean: The Divine Force impressed me far more than I was expecting it to. I was hoping for an experience that wasn’t as dull as the previous game, and I came away with fond memories and hope for the series again. It doesn’t quite reach the highs of the first few Star Ocean games, but it easily is my favorite of the more modern entries of the franchise. I once again look forward to sailing through the ocean of stars.",,,,,,,,,"I admittedly haven’t played any of the older Star Ocean games from back at the peak of its popularity, so I can’t say for certain whether Divine Force is a return to form. But for fans disappointed with the previous entry, there’s plenty here to make a dive back into the franchise worthwhile. Here’s hoping tri-Ace gets another shot with a bigger budget next time, because I believe they’re on an upswing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-callisto-protocol,"The game’s dedication to graphical fidelity feels like a blinder to thinking outside the box in every other regard. It can’t help but feel like intensive overcompensation for inconsistent, tension-less stealth, one-note combat, level design that doesn’t reward exploration, generically fleshy enemies, upgrades that don’t reward experimentation, and ineffective jump scares, from enemies that get cheap hits in on Jacob every single time, regardless of how well-prepared the player is.",,,"The Callisto Protocol's biggest misfire as a story is in failing to establish a similar rapport between player-character and world. Whatever concluding themes the plot may reach for, Lee is ultimately just a tourist here, clubbing and blasting his way through an edifice that only ever exists as an escape route. [Issue#380, p.104]",,"The Callisto Protocol is a very good horror game with a fast pace and brutal and solid gameplay. Its oppressive atmosphere offers an intense experience, which will put players to the test and give them serious cold sweats, facing abominable creatures. The title from Striking Distance is classic but devilishly effective, it doesn't bother with frills and it works very well like that. A really good ""old fashioned"" horror game as we like them.","The Callisto Protocol is mediocre at best with nothing to brag about as every aspect of the game like story, ending, boss fights, visuals and pretty much everything else is below the standards of 2022.",,"What was a candidate for game of the year for me, became just another run of the mill horror game. Amazing graphics, sound design and fun combat system can't mask what is inherently a predictable and to be honest, not-so-scary horror game.",,"As much as it can come off the rails, there is something gruesomely compelling about The Callisto Protocol that drags you through its dark, blood-soaked corridors. Perhaps it is its lavishly constructed world; finding your way out of the prison onto Callisto’s snow-whipped surface has quite the effect. Perhaps, when it works, it is the primal satisfaction of the combat; a perfectly executed dodge and clobber before lobbing another zombie into a woodchipper with your gravity glove is a grisly but undeniable rush. It is unrefined and often testing, but if those raw ingredients appeal, there is some ghoulish action to savour.",,"First out of the gate in what will be a bevy of survival titles in the coming months, The Callisto Protocol is a solid maiden effort from developer Striking Distance Studios and one that has laid the groundwork what is hopefully to come.","While not perfect, The Callisto Protocol is one of the best in its class, with jaw-dropping jump scares that’ll keep you up well into the night. With satisfying combat, incredible audio design, and jaw-dropping visuals, Striking Distance Studios has made a short but superb horror game that leaves you wanting more.",,"The Callisto Protocol is a formidable adventure, very linear (in a good way), that knows how to drink from Dead Space but finds its own way. It's a shame that introducing some items to its Season Pass limit its life so much and that its second half isn't quite as inspired. But what a good time I've had.",,,,,"The Callisto Protocol is just the new survival horror AAA game that we've been expecting. Despite not being the revolution that Dead Space brought almost 15 years ago, it's new ideas, atmosphere and general concept, are a win.","Instead of being immersed in the environment of The Callisto Protocol, I found myself thinking back and wishing more and more that I was playing Dead Space. There are promises of patches to improve some of the complaints around the actual mechanics of the game, but I don’t see anything on the horizon elevating The Callisto Protocol above mediocrity.",,"The Callisto Protocol is an enthralling horror experience when all its best elements combine. Few games have captured the sheer atmospheric dread and terror that The Callisto Protocol communicates just through sound and atmosphere. With an ambiance that seeks to get under the skin, the game constantly shifts gears, never showing its hand to the player. A few technical hiccups and lack of enemy variety will leave the player hungry for those few scares that could have been. But The Callisto Protocol is a must for horror fans yearning for a new IP that may eventually grow into a new, deadly universe.","It's a shame that The Callisto Protocol is so uninteresting at its core. Though it looks gorgeous on the surface, a dozen hours of nothing special can have a clarifying effect. Like a monstrous two-headed enemy banging Jacob's head into the ground until it collapses, the game's tedium forces you to reckon with the fact that there just isn't much once the facade splatters away.",A fantastic looking game that builds a great sci-fi world only to trash it with an unenjoyable combat challenge.,"As good as it looks, though, The Callisto Protocol is bad horror that has nothing meaningful to say and struggles to have a single original moment within it. I know that there are people out there saying that the game was “rushed out” to meet a deadline of “releasing before the Dead Space remake”… and perhaps it was! That might explain the performance issues on other platforms. However, that’s not really the problem with it. What lets this game down is that the core theme is broken to its foundations, and even if it ran perfectly at all times, in a best-case scenario, all polish would have ever done is ensure that it was entertaining enough to play. It was never going to be a horror experience that anyone remembers, even five years from now.","These problems and others make much of The Callisto Protocol ultimately feel like wasted potential. For what may be one of the most highly detailed sci-fi horror environments ever seen in a game, its rooms and hallways remain an empty - though grisly - backdrop, rarely presenting environmental narrative, anything to interact with, or a compelling pathway through. Killing mutants in the first hour feels identical to killing them in the last, and three difficulty levels only seem to affect mutant health pools. Maybe The Callisto Protocol's upcoming DLC will breathe new life and wonder into its world, but Black Iron Prison remains a far cry from the dynamic decks of the USG Ishimura.",,"The Callisto Protocol delivers the violence, intensity and horror that lives up to its Dead Space predecessor, but with deeper strategic combat. However, a cliché story and lack of original ideas means that it has one tentacle stuck in the past.",The Callisto Protocol embraces fear in a very traditional way; essentially like the saying 'if It ain't broke don't fix it'. The future of space horror games is more than guaranteed within the first step of a video game that is not afraid to look to the past; It is a video game that does not shy away from showing exactly which games inspire it.,"The Callisto Protocol is a strange game in which high production values contrast with serious problems that stem from the very basis of its outdated gameplay design. It looks awesome and sounds great but it is botched in so many ways. Clunky combat, bland weapons, awful boss encounters, heavy scripting, unintuitive interface and run-of-the-mill story built around boring characters with no personalities – it all adds up and amounts to a chore rarely interrupted by some enjoyable moments. What’s more, it’s not even a good horror game, as the designers went for annoying jump scares instead of trying to create real tension.",,"If Callisto Protocol was able to get out of its own way (and was less glitchy at launch), it probably would have been an even bigger hit.",,If you still really want to play The Callisto Protocol it would be wise to wait for any upcoming updates and significant price drop.,The Callisto Project is a game with a well thought out and balanced tempo that in many ways reminds us of the best from the Resident Evil series.,,,"Aside from one or two overly frustrating encounters, we’ve truly enjoyed our time with The Callisto Protocol. And over time, we’re sure it’s going to get better. This is a mighty debut for Striking Distance Studios, and we can’t wait to get our hands on an improved sequel or something entirely new from the studio in the future. We wholeheartedly recommended The Callisto Protocol to horror fans open to brutal close-combat encounters, but some might want to wait until features such as New Game Plus have been added and certain issues have perhaps been ironed out. With a solid update or two, it will be essential.","The Callisto Protocol is a gorgeous and gory science fiction horror experience that lives up to its big brother Dead Space in many ways, but fails to do so in others. The high production value, stellar cast of characters, top notch audio and visual design, and an excellent mix of adrenaline pumping action and terrifying horror are all overshadowed by a frustratingly designed dodge mechanic.","The Callisto Protocol is a lucid dream of a game. You want to escape the terrors flickering before you but once the game gets hold with both tentacles, you’re trapped in the hostile environment of the best horror game of the year.","The Callisto Protocol is violent and brutal, with stunning visuals, but its intimacy causes a few problems that are hard to be overlooked.",,"The Callisto Protocol clearly gets its inspiration from the older Dead Space games, thanks to co-creator Glenn Schofield being the director on the game. The survival-horror action is being presented very convincing here, with nice visuals and thrilling audio design. Sadly the gameplay is more of mixed bag, with a lot of ups and downs. Whilst not being perfect, Callisto Protocol nonetheless is a fun ride that every survival-horror fan should at least put on their radar.","The Callisto Protocol is the game fans of space ""survival horror"" have been waiting for years. It´s not a revolution in the genre, but a solid addition, full of scary moments and with a deep (and brutal) combat system.","As a spiritual successor, the game adopts many traits that are similar to Dead Space. The HUD is implemented within the design, the limbs of your opponent can be blown away and the tight camera obscures your view. While comparisons are expected, The Callisto Protocol does differ. The melee-focused combat cranks up the intensity of encounters but ultimately stumbles when facing numerous enemies. Some may not like the linearity but I felt that this helped with the pacing of the game and the effectiveness of scares. Although it never reaches the heights of its predecessor’s first two outings, it still offers a trembling trek through a terrifying detention center.","Callisto Protocol makes some mistakes, but in general computing the good wins by far. It is true that it is somewhat angry to see that something with so much potential has not been fully squeezed, but what it offers is already much more than most. We trust that combat system that we have loved and its setting to make the game worthwhile and we would love to see a second installment.","Gloriously gory visuals let down by an unoriginal and scarce story, by-the-books gameplay and minimal replayability.","Superb in setting, visuals, sound and other technical parts, The Callisto Protocol is impressive from start to finish and a brutal experience that is lacking these days. Although it is not perfect and some problems can be noticed, as well as the lack of content beyond the main campaign, there is a lot of quality showing that the game delivers what was promised.",,,"The Callisto Protocol continues Dead Space's legacy in a very competent manner. It might very well be the beginning of a new series, because the most important thing - scaring the player - works very well here.","The Callisto Protocol is a unique and often good game which is hindered by its own ambition. The fighting system is sure to be hit and miss with audiences, and the difficulty coupled with the slow movement and weapon swapping will surely turn a few people off. Despite this, Protocol builds a unique world that would benefit from further entries diving more into its backstory and is brought to life with incredibly detailed graphics, fantastic sound design, and gorgeous lighting. The Callisto Protocol may not be the survival horror game many had hoped for, but it does successfully carve out its own niche.","The Callisto Protocol is frustrating as a game because it's so easy to see how it could have been great. There's no single thing that drags down the game, but it's an endless stream of annoyances that are exacerbated by the constant reminders of better titles. The Callisto Protocol can be fun, but it's constantly getting in the way of its own fun. It's possible that patches might smooth out some of the combat issues and improve the game a fair bit. At launch, though, it's more frustrating than fun. There's a lot of potential for a sequel that takes the lessons to heart, but for the moment, you're better off waiting for a sale.",The Callisto Protocol is a decent spiritual successor to Dead Space that's often too careful. The intense action and visual beauty isn't bad at all. But the lack of originality in both story and gameplay are obvious.,"The Callisto Protocol is a sublime horror experience in atmosphere and immersion, offering a worthy challenge when it comes to single-enemy combat or against a mini-boss. The problem appears when the hordes arrive: when fighting many enemies, the rough combat mechanics are very noticeable. And being such a combat-centric survival horror, these shortcomings keep it from being one of the best of the year. [Review in Progress]","The Callisto Protocol is a modest starting point for what I hope will flourish into another heavy-hitting horror franchise. It's gory and gratuitous, with an endlessly satisfying combat system. But the lack of enemy variety scares, and surprises, even if engaging, stop it from being the horror game masterpiece it's trying to be. Despite all of its shortcomings, it's an immensely enjoyable romp that's left me desperate for more.",Amazing graphics and talented voice acting isn’t enough to save The Callisto Protocol from the beast that is bad game mechanics. The game is its own worst enemy.,The Callisto Protocol is an atmospheric graphics phony that can rival Dead Space only in rudiments in terms of gameplay.,"Playing The Callisto Protocol made me feel like I'm wasting my time and I rarely feel that way when I play video games. With simple and repetitive combat and a world that's completely void of tension yet still filled with absurd amounts of violence, it can go suck an egg.","The Callisto Protocol is not a groundbreaking experience or the best horror game ever, but it’s a pretty good one. The amazing visuals, great cast, perfect settings and intense combat make it one of the most enjoyable adventures of 2022 - although it’s quite short (and sometimes glitchy).",,,"The Creator of Dead Space is back to horror and it hits hard. The Callisto Protocol is an intense, violent and old-school survival-horror. A game with a sense of horrific aesthetics that hits the nail on the head, a delightful atmosphere carried by a devastating sound design and a solid, brutal and gore combat system. Very Good.","The Callisto Protocol prevails at setting the mood and making you feel like you are part of the action, but it comes up short when delivering an experience that keeps your attention longer than the initial jump scare.",Everything in The Callisto Protocol is carefully crafted and made with a lot of love for the horror genre. The result is a unique survival experience with an intriguing story and tense captivating gameplay. It redefines what a survival horror can be and it will go down in history as a masterpiece.,,"The Callisto Protocol is a consistently good game that, when it's at its best, gives many of the survival horror greats a run for their money. However, there's no getting around the fact the game has very little to truly call its own. In borrowing so heavily from Dead Space, there's always a sense of having been there, done that. With frame rate issues and an unimaginative story with poor characters, The Callisto Protocol is good. But it's not great.",The Callisto Protocol is a game that any survival horror fan should try. It is also a sample of what the new consoles can achieve. Both graphically and in a matter of immersion. With an exciting story and beautiful settings.,"A visually beautiful sci-fi experience which, surprisingly, doesn’t resort to simply cloning Dead Space. The difficulty and the fear factor both don’t reach the heights I’d expect, however. A shame! It could have been extraordinary.",,"Dead Space 4 in all but name, except with no puzzles and surprisingly little suspense. The Callisto Protocol has plenty of gritty action but that’s not quite enough to sustain interest for its entire duration.","In space, no one will hear you scream... with joy or anger? Building on the rock-solid foundation of the first Dead Space, The Callisto Protocol dodges the photocopy with its intense, difficult, but not as precise melee combat as we would have liked. Despite a certain lack of audacity, Striking Distance managed to steal Saturn's rings in order to slip them on the ring fingers of sci-fi horror lovers. Fasten your asteroid belt, the Space Mountain gore will shake you up, even if the trip turns out to be as imperfect as it is classic.",,The Callisto Protocol succeeds as a desolate and brutal survival horror experience in its opening hours. But the second half is hindered by massive difficulty spikes and clunky melee combat.,,"A wonderfully exhausting exercise in futility is probably the best way of describing The Callisto Protocol as no matter the strength of my own resolve, I was constantly on edge and reveling in those fleeting moments where the game allowed me to breathe following yet another life-threatening fight. The constant fear and dread incited by the phenomenal visual and sound design are only complemented by the compelling story. The Callisto Protocol is, hopefully, the start of an exciting new franchise, and is another sign that survival horror is anything but dead.",,,,"The Callisto Protocol is the real sequel to Dead Space that we never had and it took Glen Schofield to return to the horror game to get it. However, even if the game takes up all the codes of EA's survival horror with its stressful atmosphere, perfectly mastered, and its really enjoyable gore side, The Callisto Protocol also innovates thanks to its melee combat system, which allows interesting combinations and obliges you to plan your battle plan well, otherwise you will be quickly overwhelmed. A great success and we want a sequel with even more new ideas.",,"Repetitive survival horror that feels like a life sentence, The Callisto Protocol is as bereft of life as the harsh conditions of the moon on which it’s set.

Buy it.","Dead Space comparisons are impossible to avoid - but while The Callisto Protocol's missing some of the depth and tension, it makes up for it with production value and bloody-minded fun. [Eurogamer Recommended]","The Callisto Protocol was touted as the next Dead Space and it unfortunately suffers for that comparison. With frustrating, awkward combat, an uninteresting plot, and jump scares that fall completely flat, The Callisto Protocol struggles in the shadow of its spiritual predecessor, which did all of those things better 14 years ago. (This is all not to mention the full-screen strobing light effects that cannot be turned off; an accessibility failure that one would not expect of a modern AAA game.) It's a pity that Callisto copied the aesthetic of Dead Space while failing to execute the aspects that made it frightening and fun. [Quick Look]","I consider The Callisto Protocol one of the most ambitious games I played this year, maybe even the most next to Elden Ring (though I think Elden Ring is in a league of its own—I don’t know if anything will be able to approach its depth and sophistication for a long time). Its thoughtful attention to environment, sound, and touch is what, I think, next-gen gaming should be like: an experiment with the senses and with story. The game has its issues, too, which can’t be ignored. But at least it feels human.",,"With The Callisto Protocol, Striking Distance proves it can capably create nerve-wracking moments of tension and horror with a well-crafted combination of sights, sounds, and atmosphere. The studio was smart not to create a one-to-one copy of Dead Space — especially with original publisher Electronic Arts now returning to the franchise with a remake due next month. But still: The Callisto Protocol could have borrowed a few more lessons from its spiritual inspiration, and further refined its mechanics to make a game that plays as good as it looks.","One of the best-looking releases of the past few years from a technical and artistic standpoint, so heavily undermined by everything else surrounding it, The Callisto Protocol caps off 2022 with a release devoid in substance and all the more disappointing because of it.","The Callisto Protocol shines best in its visceral, moment-to-moment combat, which strikes a good balance between feeling tense, and intuitive. What lets it down is a story that feels a little too unfinished and a few design choices that stick out like a sore thumb in this day and age.",,,"We can confidently say Dead Space fans will delight in its bloody mutant-shredding carnage, Striking Distance Studio using the classic 2008 horror as a template while inventing new and interesting gameplay ideas of its own.","Sadly, it’s tough to feel connected to the characters, but if you’re hungry for an action-filled survival horror experience, The Callisto Protocol has just what you need.",,"The Callisto Protocol is a good game that falls short in almost every department of being a great one. Predictable story, gratifying-yet clunky combat mechanics and a lack of variety hold back what is an otherwise visual and audible spectacle. Dead Space has cast a long shadow since its release in 2008 and The Callisto Protocol can’t emerge from the depth of its superb darkness.","The Callisto Protocol looks stunning and can offer small doses of fun, but from misguided gameplay choices and hyper-linear design to ineffectual attempts at horror and a bland story, it stumbles and disappoints in too many ways to be labelled as anything but a disappointment.",,"The Callisto Protocol is not Dead Space and it stumbles over more than one design choice: the close-quarters combat defuse the fear of enemies who have nothing to do with the gruesome Necromorphs, the direction often does not manages to build the fear and tension that one would expect and the story ends up being predictable. However, the game also delivers solid gameplay and stunning graphics.","On the scenic front, The Callisto Protocol hits the bull's-eye with a first-rate, forward-looking visual presentation, and with a long series of intense encounters with horrific monstrosities, which react credibly to the electric baton blasts that hit them. Alternating body to body shooting or the use of the gravitational glove can give real adrenaline rushes but not the tension that many expected. From the progression at times not very stimulating, up to some playful imbalances, which emerge above all in the course of specific boss fights, this horror-tinged action is certainly a ""good first"" for Striking Distance Studios but, also thanks to a problematic narrative sector, it failed to express - sadly - its full potential.","The Callisto Protocol is the best start for a new survival horror series to date. Schofield, Papoutsis and the other veterans at Striking Distance Studios have managed to create a new nightmare with a very bright future ahead.",,,,,"The Callisto Protocol is definitely not an evolution of Dead Space or even a title of equal quality that we wanted it to be. It’s certainly a pleasant experience for horror fans, thanks to the one-note, but satisfying combat, as well as it’s no-frills linear design. Nevertheless, it’s a by the numbers horror title without many (if any) surprises and a crucial lack of variety in enemies and combat/ survival situations.",,,,,"The Callisto Protocol is a satisfyingly gory spiritual successor to the Dead Space series, but it’s ultimately more of a striking modern mimic than a scary new mutation.","Even if this game is at first glance a Dead Space clone, Callisto Protocol manages to differentiate from its predecessor gracefully. Unfortunately some annoying design choices, repetitiveness and technical difficulties are preventing it from taking the throne of the genre.","The Callisto Protocol convinced from the beginning with a great atmosphere, an interesting story and beautiful graphics. Also the gameplay is really satisfying throughout the game. Some technical issues impede the high score, but it’s still a contender for Game of the Year.","The Callisto Protocol reaches for what Dead Space once achieved, and falls dishearteningly short. It re-creates all of the brutality and tension that drained the blood from our faces whilst playing Dead Space, but once you then find yourself actively fighting for your life, leaves you quickly frustrated and let down. ",,"While The Callisto Protocol runs somewhere between 12-16 hours, none of that time is wasted in making an intriguing narrative that hopefully acts as a foothold for more new ideas in this world to come. It’s up against some tough competition, particularly with the remake of Dead Space next year, but the new ideas it brings forward make it a game horror fans won’t want to miss.","For those who were expecting the next Dead Space, I’m sad to report that The Callisto Protocol just isn’t quite it. Instead, Striking Distance Studios has crafted a largely by-the-numbers horror-action title with terrific presentation that could’ve been something truly special. Unfortunately, while your journey across the titular dead moon is a sporadically fun and entertaining ride, it fails to authentically push the genre forward in any meaningful way. Still, despite all that… at least you get to stomp on stuff, right? Phew!","The Callisto Protocol gave me nightmares. It's the best horror game of the year, and a bright new contender in the survival horror genre.","An intense atmospheric adventure with an intriguing premise, The Callisto Protocol delivers a solid horror game that focuses largely on its satisfying combat. It doesn't have much variety and is lacking a bit of creativity, but it makes up for that with impressive visuals and disgusting, intimidating monsters. It might not meet the expectations of its obvious inspirations, but The Callisto Protocol lays a strong foundation of terrifying atmosphere and crunchy combat that makes it satisfying and spooky nonetheless.",,"Horror fans can't avoid this title: ingenious, extremely atmospheric visuals, an extremely finely woven carpet of sound and a juicy portion of gore make Callisto one of the scariest games of all time.",,The Callisto Protocol immerses you in its world full of horror and gore to the bone combined with that wonderful photo-realism of the characters and environment. The gameplay is a pure Dead Space feeling but clunky. It has the features of a survival game but it still has a lot to implement. The game is more like a Josh Duhamel simulator.,"The Callisto Protocol is a gripping science fiction horror game and a worthy spiritual successor to the Dead Space franchise. Some of the gameplay and mechanics choices may be off-putting but do not detract enough to ruin the terrifying experience. In the same vein as cult classic horror movies, The Callisto Protocol prioritizes doing things well enough to be fun and approachable.","The Callisto Protocol is brutal, violent and will send chills down your spine. What Striking Distance Studios did is far from perfection, but don't let that discourage you. The Callisto Protocol is a horror experience that is well worth getting to know. Just don't expect it to be a legendary game that changes the industry.",,"The Callisto Protocol is a title that will not disorient the connoisseurs of the genre with many features undeniably coming from Dead Space. Nevertheless, it remains in its own right with many innovative features. One thinks in particular of the infiltration phases that are reminiscent of The Last of Us and the combat system that is much more nervous than usual. Striking Distance Studios' latest game has a breathtaking technique that will be remembered, but suffers from a certain lack of creativity for its bestiary and the depth of the characters. Hopefully, the DLC will be able to improve the game's shortcomings. To let off steam and live a somewhat horrific experience, The Callisto Protocol remains a good survival.","These various problems aside, though, The Callisto Protocol is still doing a lot of what Dead Space did, for better and worse. And to that end, there are moments of fun, even if, in contrast, they’re light on genuine terror. I’m okay with The Callisto Protocol being another version of its spiritual predecessor, but it struggles to nail even the basics. As a result, I’m underwhelmed, annoyed, and disappointed. If you wanted anything more out of this second crack at making a new sci-fi IP in survival horror, or something markedly different that acknowledges just how far gaming has come since 2008, The Callisto Protocol is not your answer.",,,"The Callisto Protocol is a competent survival horror game but a poor man's Dead Space, making it only worth it for those diehard fans of the genre.","An action horror clearly inspired by Dead Space, but also by Alien and Riddick's movies/games. The Callisto Protocol has promised a lot in recent months and after completing it we can say that it has kept almost all its words. Get ready for a thrilling experience from which it will be very difficult for you to tear yourself away.",,"The Callisto Protocol isn’t scary. It isn’t fun. It isn’t entertaining, fascinating, or mildly enriching. It lays a self-entitled claim to Dead Space’s stylistic and mechanical elements yet wields not a single one with grace, instead performing a crude pantomime. It’s mechanically unpleasant, bereft of a single original idea, and hostile to its own players. There's literally one jumpscare tactic reused at a rate best described as pathological. It's got some damn nerve wanting to be seen as a worthy successor - it can't even rival the weakest of pretenders.","It’s been hard to hide my disappointment with The Callisto Protocol throughout this review. While the game has the same creative forces behind Dead Space, and many of the features are retconned into the game, it’s not quite lived up to my expectations. The game strikes me as a conglomerate of ideas, like a novel approach to dodging, a similar but different storyline, tough combat borrowed from challenging games like Dark Souls, packed into a beautifully presented game. But here’s the thing: all of these ideas sound great in isolation. But the execution here in The Callisto Protocol makes for an inferior gaming experience compared to other titles.",,"Beautiful audiovisuals and heaps of gore almost manage to cover up the lack of innovation in The Callisto Protocol. Everything in this game feels done many, many times before - but nonetheless we're having fun.",,,"Through its rhythm and its brutality, The Callisto Protocol manages to put player in constant tension and discomfort, offering a memorable experience.","The Callisto Protocol is a solid first entry in what Striking Distance hopes to be the next big horror franchise. Flawed, but unique and engaging melee combat is a fun way to fight against terrifying foes, while Black Iron Prison is an alluring space to investigate. Limited exploration, a cliché story, and forgettable firearms hold it back from being truly great. However, underneath the blemishes, The Callisto Protocol pushes horrifying visual detail to emphasize tense and perilous encounters.",,,,,,,,,,"The Callisto Protocol is big dumb fun. Sadly, there’s so much middling combat that it blots out all of the great work in characterisation, art and atmosphere. The Callisto Protocol is a love letter to video game and cinematic horror that fails to be more than a scrapbook, a pale imitation of the genre’s best bits.",,,,"These little irritations are all over the place in The Callisto Protocol, steadily eroding what little fun there is at every turn. There’s the long wait time between checkpoints—because nothing screams “Spooky!” like repeating a five-minute section of gameplay for the fourth or fifth time, teeth grinding as you realize just how boring walking down these endless corridors can be. There’s the awkward weapon-switching mechanics, which make fumbling a different gun out of your inventory an exercise in annoyance. And there’s the endless low-grade frustration of thinking you’re properly dodging a hit, only to have a third of your health sliced off because of unclear signaling. It all adds together to make something that’s less than the sum of its parts—and significantly less than the sum of all the games whose legacy it ill-advisedly invokes.

Experiment 101 put together a strange chimera of ideas in their game that never quite connects in meaningful ways. Finding fun was hard because the story isn’t great, exploration is a chore, and combat is serviceable. I did like the puzzle-like nature of the Worldeater boss fights because they break the monotony of quests. Technologically speaking, the game looks and performs well enough. However, I encountered a few bugs that required dying or hopping to the title screen to fix. All in all, Biomutant had the potential to be a frolicking Zelda-like but everything about this ecologically-minded adventure falls short of its ambition.",,,,,,,,"Even a year later, Biomutant still left us impressed in just about every area.

FieldSENSE is a good change that goes along with the other recent additions in the series. The Freeform Passing is a huge and fun change and the new hit animation engine is nice, but it can leave the occasional strange animation and outcome. The defensive coverage needs to be addressed as there seems to be glaring issues. The visuals continue to improve to bring a more realistic approach and the change to the presentation is a nice touch. Franchise Mode players should enjoy the changes to scouting and the offseason even though the in-season portion remains largely unchanged. The mode still needs a better attachment to the storyline of the season. While the changes are good, there’s still a good bit left in the dust. Ultimate Team returns with new ways to earn rewards with Field Pass.

Visually, it's stunning with some wonderful views and spectacular weather effects. Unfortunately, the career mode really limits what players can do and drip-feeds content at a relatively slow pace. There's a real lack of modes and the racing is hampered by some poor AI. I never really felt confident with the handling model but at least navigation seems more straight-forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dakar Desert Rally is a game full of peaks and troughs. Your heart will be racing when you’re hurtling through a desert during a sandstorm in a rally car, but when just a little too much throttle causes you to spin your bike and move from first to last in the middle of a snowy battle, you’ll be beyond frustrated. Still, it captures the essence of the controversial rally pretty well.

Sure, it’s hard to hit all the right spots from the very beginning, but aside from an enjoyable Dakar racing experience, the game needs refinements in many key areas. There still are a few performance glitches here and there, and the AI is ridiculously stupid every now and then, as it has absolutely no problem pushing you out of the track if it can’t get past you. The game system also requires more polishing. If there’s something you can truly enjoy, it’s the pure off-road experience on dunes, in water, and so on. The scenery is beautiful, so if you’re not playing the game to win races, you could have an absolute blast with this game. Otherwise, you may end up disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,"Despite a lack of content, perfectible driving and unsophisticated opponents, Dakar Desert Rally comes to dust off the automotive genre with style. Based on the sumptuous landscapes of Saudi Arabia, Saber Interactive's game displays a remarkable achievement and should delight those looking for a different racing game.

Thanks to these additions, Dakar Desert Rally opens up to a wider audience without cutting itself off from purists. With its impression of successful speed, its panoramas and sumptuous effects and its huge map, there is plenty to have fun while waiting for possible extensions. Undoubtedly the automotive surprise of this fall.",,,,,,,,"Ambitious and promising, Dakar Desert Rally is ultimately not the great rally game that we were sold. Even if its open world is pleasant to browse, especially when the navigation aids are deactivated, the game still has problems already present in Dakar 18. We think in particular of the physics not developed, the weakness of the AI, to the indications of the co-pilot which are not connected with what we see on the track, or to the still too numerous bugs.

It has something of the charm and the shortcomings of the old VHS releases. The story is not new or unpredictable, but it does its job, the puzzles are not very hard, and the combat is basic. It is the kind of experience that engulfs you for a weekend day, being entertaining without expecting too much from its players. The limited level and game design are balanced out by the eerie atmosphere of the island. The Chant remains a breezy action-adventure with some horror elements, not that great, not terrible either.","The Chant is a pleasant surprise for fans of action and psychological horror.

It could’ve been a new fascinating way to approach and manage combat situations with three meters that operate together in harmony, giving you complex gameplay decisions to tackle alongside challenging combat. It could’ve been a new campy horror game, a guilty pleasure, similar to some of those dreadful TV shows I named at the start. But unfortunately, it’s neither of these things.

Playing as the ghost, on the other hand, has its own inherent challenges of finding the balance between being outmatched and doing the steamrolling. Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed has all the right pieces when it comes to making a GB game that feels authentic – it's bringing those pieces together in the right way every time that can hurt its fun factor.","Illfonic completely understands what it takes to fulfill every player’s wish of being a Ghostbuster in Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed. While some of the gameplay elements could be tweaked a bit better to provide a bit more of a responsive experience, I truly felt like a Ghostbuster the entire time. With awesome story beats placed throughout to keep the leveling-up experience worthwhile and exciting gameplay to keep every job feeling fun, Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed is the realization of the perfect Ghostbusters experience.",,,,,,,,,,"And, as I sit here writing this, I can’t wait to zip up my flight suit and step back into my combat boots to bust some more.

It feels like developer IllFonic pulled out all the stops to make this a great asymmetrical title, including notable attention to detail with all the Ghostbusters callbacks. In single player, the enemy AI was fine, but the teammate AI was horrible, driving home the fact that I was playing alone. If I could convince four other humans to play with me, I could invest hours of time without blinking; it’s a shame this game requires five people to enjoy it properly.",,,,,,"Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed is a great fit for asymmetrical multiplayer.

There are many different roles to play whether you’re a ghostbuster or a ghost and the core framework of both roles offers a variety of mayhem to either solve or create. Changing up how you play each role is easy with upgrade chains and skill trees and it’s got a generous leveling up system as well to minimize grinding. It’s a good-looking game with room for improvement when it comes to reflections, but nails the sound design perfectly for a team-based Ghostbusters adventure.",,,,,,,"Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed is a clear love letter to a much-beloved franchise, and it’s IllFonic’s most polished product to date.

Illfonic clearly put a lot of time, effort, and love of the IP into this game, and playing it with pals is initially very fun, whether you're playing as a Ghostbuster or a ghost. However, the game's shelf life is incredibly short, as the gameplay loop quickly becomes repetitive and stale.

thymesia,,,,,,,"The fact that Thymesia is developed by a very small group of people with a very limited budget and in a very challenging genre, earns them enough credit to give their game a try and set them up for their future projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite being a solid Bloodborne imitation, Thymesia carries over common issues in other Soulslikes. It's a great challenge for Bloodborne fans and offers the potential for exciting gameplay, but it weighs itself down with complicated and poorly implemented mechanics.","Bottomline, Thymesia does not stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the giants of the genre, but it’s a great game in its own right. Though it falters some in areas like presentation, story, and level design, the combat and upgrade systems are a lot of fun, even if the enemy variety gets to feeling a little thin by the end. Personally, I hope we see a lot more from Overboard Studios and Corvus in the future as there is a lot of potential to be realized yet.",,,"If you can handle the corners that were cut due to the budget, then Thymasia’s combat system is worth it all on its own. The game’s intriguingly dark setting and the exquisitely dark theme are more than good enough to pay attention to as well. There are certainly things that the development team could do with a sequel if this generates enough revenue to build on the foundations that they’ve created, but the earnestness that went into making this one distinctive from the other “Souls clones” is worthwhile either way.",,,,,,,"Thymesia isn't shy about its influences, an admittance that helps and harms the title when inevitably compared to its legendary brethren.",,"Thymesia is just another Bloodborne + Sekiro wannabe with small budget and big ambitions. On the other hand, it has something special inside it that keeps you playing on and on. And that's a great result for the small team.",,,,"Thymesia is quite a good Soulslike. Aside from some attacks homing in on you a little too well, only things like a lack of voice acting and uneven boss difficulty truly let it down. It’s not as polished or as epic as any of FromSoftware’s releases, but that’s to be expected given the budget price and the fact that this is the first title from developer Over Border Studio. So, keep your expectations in check, and you’re bound to have a good time.",,,,,,"Thymesia is a humble indie soulsborne that, despite its marked inspirations and forced comparisons with giants like Bloodborne, manages to bring some other details to the genre. It lags behind in many aspects, but it also manages to attract attention through frenetic and fun combat.",,,,"Thymesia is a game with beautiful graphics and good gameplay, however, what it offers in exchange for exploration is not enough to keep the game alive for long. If the title had a multiplayer mode, it would probably earn some more points, but this is unfortunately not present.",,,,,,Thymesia has copied a little too much from 'big brother' Bloodborne. The game has more than enough due to the phenomenal combat system. In this respect it is perhaps better than its two biggest sources of inspiration and such an achievement cannot but be rewarded. Even if it involves unabashed stealing.,,,,A brutal challenge for melee fans that shines on bosses and the combat system but falls short on the areas in the game.,Thymesia is one of those games that you should take its reviews with a grain of salt because it's an obviously clunky game yet its combat can be super-satisfying for the very specific kinds of gamers that it's targeting. Everyone else will probably find it too irritating to play.,,,,,,,,"If more of the game had the degree of polish that reaving does, the game could have been something special. The end result is a small-scale game with lofty aspirations that miss the mark. Stealing specials is great, but everything surrounding that is unimpressive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Thymesia makes us feel like the soulslike genre is completely played out already. A poor and needless Bloodborne substitute. No substance, little style. [Issue#19, p.81]",,,,,,"Despite some repetition, then, the full game doesn’t feel miserly, and can easily last 15-20 hours — comparable at least to other character action games such as “Devil May Cry.” Also, in the wake of the gargantuan “Elden Ring” this year, it’s quite comforting to see this kind of challenge return to more finite space. Ultimately, you may have walked grimy paths like these many times, but if the Soulslike virus remains lodged in your core as it does in Thymesia’s, you should easily become absorbed into its diseased world, never once hoping to be cured.",,,,,,"Thymesia is a game that show’s the developer’s potential, but doesn’t reach the heights of its opening promise. While the combat is fast paced and fun, it is marred by hitbox and timing issues, and the story and lore lack depth to draw you into the mystery of Thymesia.",,,"It is a little rough around the edges, which is to be expected from a small team and backed by an indie publisher. Stick with Thymesia however and you’ll make some good memories with it, hopefully with some care down the line to refine the experience.","Thymesia does more than enough to make its way out of the shadow of Bloodborne. It offers some fun levels to go around killing enemies in, and the combat is fast-paced, responsive, and most importantly, a lot of fun. Even its skill tree has some great ideas. This might not be the game for those who don’t like a challenge, but for those who do, Thymesia is excellent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Even though the setting and many gameplay elements in Thymesia aren’t new for Soulslike-enthusiasts, the game’s enjoyable combat and progression show that the developers understand the genre. The versatile plague weapons are fun to collect and use, while the compact skill system allows for useful fine-tuning when bosses get difficult. And while they rarely do that, most of them offer unique and varied encounters. But the particularly hard bosses do exhibit some of the game’s wonky difficulty balancing and sometimes imprecise gameplay mechanics. Also, Thymesia isn’t a very big or replayable game, though the fair asking price somewhat alleviates that.",,,,,,,,"Pleasant Soulslike with a well thought-out, fast combat system and a crisp level of difficulty, which often goes too far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A welcome change of scenery to the faster strain of Soulslikes, Thymesia gets straight to the point of sword and claw without lasting any longer than necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disgaea-6-complete,,,,,,,,Disgaea 6 finally arrives on PlayStation consoles in the West and brings all its DLC with it in this Complete edition. It has the majority of what you expect from a Disgaea but certain elements are lacking whilst others that have been introduced maybe aren't for the best. Ultimately I can see some enjoying the additions and others resenting them so approach with caution and you may be pleasantly surprised.,,,,,"Even though Disgaea 6 Complete brings in accessibility options, the game itself reacts negatively to some of them. A simplistic AI can't contend with automation, while the hefty price tag alone for a year old game makes this a hard pass. There are hints of fun here for a new player, but in making this game easier to play, Disgaea 6 Complete makes the franchise formula look antiquated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Disgaea 6 Complete is a huge improvement on the Switch version of the game, and is worth diving into Dood!",,,,,,,"Looking at Disgaea 6 Complete is somewhat complex as a longtime fan of the franchise. It is undeniable that it brings a series of quality of life improvements and is more accessible to new players, but the simplification of important mechanics and a story that fails to excite make it a generic title, able to please at certain times, but nothing remarkable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Disgaea 6 Complete is the perfect strategy RPG package for fans of the franchise and those looking to get their tactical fix. It won't convert those who have bounced off previous titles, but that was never the developer's intention in the first place. It's a little rough around the edges, but Disgaea 6 provides an immensely satisfying experience to its niche audience, who wouldn't have it any other way.",,,,,,,,,,"Disgaea 6 Complete offers a substantial main quest and a very huge endgame, capable of entertaining both the veterans and the newbies of the brand. Furthermore, this release has the advantage of solving the various technical problems that plagued the Nintendo Switch version. Fun and challenging, the game is recommended for all lovers of tactical jrpg.",,,,,"The story keeps you guessing, and the twisty plot is the main highlight. From the moment you meet Zed, you’re drawn into a heart-wrenching and humorous tale, and the strong narrative and whimsical characters will draw you to stick it out to the end. But you need to get through an awful lot of battles, and with a combat system that takes too long to show its good side, the Complete package may be too much. [Issue#17, p.89]",,,,,,,,"The only thing complete about this is the amount of content stuffed in this small package. Complete comes with everything you may want from Disgaea 6, but what this has done to the franchise has been a huge disappointment. At least you can recruit some of the members of Hololive on your team.",,,,,,,,"Disgaea 6 Complete doesn’t really shake up the original’s formula, but it’s still a good time. Sure, character models look pretty bland and animate weirdly, but the humour and general atmosphere is still great.",,Disgaea 6 is a masterful turn based RPG with a few interesting features that lacks visuals and narrative.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Disgaea 6 Complete is, overall, a stronger entry in the series than the original Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny, yet still leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to game balance, quality of life, and ease of use. The many game mechanics are simply too varied and plentiful, and while the game’s cast and plot are a fun ride, the best of them are left as afterthoughts as part of the pack-in DLC. The performance and stability fixes will be welcomed by those who struggled with the Switch port, as the powerful PS5 and PCs run the game with ease. I would say fans of SRPGs should definitely give Disgaea 6 Complete a spin, but expect a devilishly cheeky time that does not conform to the genre’s traditional values.",,,,Disgaea 6 Complete is a worthy sequel to the series but lacks important mechanics that fans are going to miss. It is extremely entertaining and will keep you going for hours climbing stratospheric levels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While Disgaea 1,4, and 5 are excellent on Switch and my favorite versions of the games, Disgaea 6 has too many technical issues on Nintendo's hybrid system to be an easy recommendation. Disgaea 6 Complete for PS5 still carries over some of the core game issues from the base release on Switch last year, but it is a massively better experience thanks to huge improvements in resolution, frame rate, and overall performance. The addition of all DLC with some bonuses right from the start definitely helps make this the version of Disgaea 6 I recommend for newcomers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, that sucks all the fun out of an otherwise unique space adventure.",,"What you will have to take note of, is the totally inconsistence frame rate. The game often chugs and gets choppy at certain points for no discernible reason, with some of the bigger set piece moments running fine, while regular exploration at high speeds can really have an impact on performance. I wouldn’t say it’s terrible, but definitely noticeable when they’re often unexpected, and happen often enough that you never truly forget about them.",,,,,,,,,,,"While it presents itself well and has some neat ideas, Jett: The Far Shore never launches into the stars. Flying around, soaking in the atmosphere, and gathering info on a foreign planet is relaxing fun, but it's scuppered by messy combat scenarios and a story that falls flat. You may get some enjoyment from this, as does have its moments — just don't expect it to hit the stratosphere.",,,,,,,"You can't outrun the sheer horror of existence, but Jett: The Far Shore lets you try. Its heavy narrative is a perfect complement to its exhilarating gameplay.",,,"JETT: The Far Shore is a space opera with a soundtrack so outstanding, an art compartment so beautiful, and a narrative premise so compelling that in the end it really hurts to find out that it's just an old-fashioned, “normal” video game.

Unfortunately it is not even now. It is a not at all veiled reference to the intuitions of No Man's Sky, but having adapted that playful structure to a narrative that exists and also has not indifferent apexes. The problem is almost entirely in the gameplay, which together with unresponsive controls transforms even the simplest of activities into a grueling struggle with the game system. A real shame, unfortunately, since the game was intended as a placid and relaxing experience.","Impactful and unique, JETT The Far Shore is an interesting space adventure, contemplative and thoroughly unique.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"JETT reaches for the stars, and it is tantalising to watch it do so.

The story does captivate, helped with a great audio, but the end feels like unfinished.",,,,"JETT: The Far Shore has moments of brilliance, but they're buried under an overload of mechanics that aren't enjoyable and a general lack of polish. Similarly any philosophical value in its narrative ideas is ruined by needlessly obfuscated dialogue. There's something to be discovered here, but it's just not worth the trip.","Jett: The Far Shore is at its best when you're speeding through the air and provided with the agency to figure out how to reach your destination, not slowly hovering around a space and having someone hold your hand through every step of a puzzle. Regular occurrences of the latter drag down the whole experience, and the overall narrative--though intriguingly set-up--ultimately ends in an unfulfilling way, with protagonist Mei feeling too detached from the story and the themes it's trying to explore.",,,,,,"JETT: The Far Shore makes a good first impression with its retro sci-fi visual design and expressive flight model. But it’s difficult to connect with its story and your team when you have limited scope to make discoveries and supposedly dangerous events prove trivial to deal with. Only in the final stages does it let you spread your wings a little, and feels more powerful as a result.",,,,,,,,"Jett: The Far Shore is a stylish, fascinating, and challenging work of art that may inspire you to say some very naughty words. While it sometimes succeeds as a chill exploratory experience, iffy controls, poor navigational tools, and overly convoluted missions often harsh the game’s vibe. That said, if you’re the type that can appreciate a game for its world and message, despite some issues with its minute-to-minute gameplay, feel free to join the Jett set.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Creating a game about making a home on foreign land was never going to be easy, and JETT had boldly sought to subvert the themes of colonialism that are so inherent to tales like these. But upon putting down the controller, I mostly felt let down by how little it had to say on the subject. While it touches on other topics, such as the terrifyingly big expanse of space, versus our miniscule existence in the greater scheme of things, these weren’t enough to make up for its flaws. In the end, I just wish JETT had the confidence to pursue what I know it wants to be: to subvert expectations on the well-trodden ground of survival stories."
spacebase-startopia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spacebase Startopia is not completely without merit, but it does lack in charm and depth, and simulators need one or the other (and preferably both) else they're in big trouble. With that being said there is a very specific audience for this game; it works as a competitive simulator where you learn the perfect order for doing things and then execute on that to cruise through to easy victories. In almost any other context, however, Spacebase Startopia lacks the creative whimsy and data-driven depth that we usually expect from a great simulator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spacebase Startopia is a reasonably fun management/strategy game, slightly too complex to play with a controller. Though genre veterans will not find much challenge here, Spacebase Startopia is unique and cheerful enough to make it worth a look.",,"Spacebase Startopia is a complex management-sim, but once everything clicks there's plenty of fun to be had.

gotham-knights,"Because its gameplay is already dramatically simplified compared to that of the Arkham series, Gotham Knights fails to fill the cowl.",,"Gotham Knights succeeds in bringing an action-packed but also extremely sentimental story that explores different characters' reactions to grief and the impact of missing a symbol such as Batman. However, several missed opportunities keep the game from the ""unforgettable"" title, although it can be considered almost mandatory for Batman fans.","Between a legacy it can't quite shake and a jumble of borrowed mechanics that fit neither the format nor the fantasy, Gotham Knights simply isn't it. [Issue#379, p.114]",,"Gotham Knights is a good game. Gotham is sublime and the four characters offer rich gameplay, with four distinct styles. The narration is mastered and we take real pleasure in discovering or rediscovering the slightly reworked story of the Court of Owls, alongside the well-written heroes. The secondary activities are quite repetitive but others explore the lore pleasantly. Apart from a capricious camera and a few dated elements, we're having a great time there. Even without Batman.","Gotham Knights fails to meet the expectations set by the Arkham series, and even though there is huge potential and material to work with, the end products is subpar in almost every aspect.",,"Stunning visuals and a well-thought story cannot compensate for this game’s lackluster gameplay. Recurrent frame drops, detached development decisions and generic fight mechanics make Gotham Knights nothing more than a disappointing grind-fest and serve as a stern reminder for the cruciality of player feedback during the development cycle.","Gotham Knights is a prime example of mediocrity and lack of direction. With some useful and interesting ideas, it starts promising but is drawn back fast by its repetitive and clunky combat systems that fail to differ much, with a lack of enemy variety, empty-ish world and weak mission design.",If the Arkham games are Christopher Nolan levels of invention and genius then Gotham Knights is hanging out down in the DC Extended Universe with Zak Snyder and Aquaman. Set your expectations accordingly and there’s enjoyable entertainment to be had.,,"Gotham Knights step out of the shadows of the Dark Knight and provide a breath of fresh air with four unique characters that provide a different approach to protecting Gotham. Gotham Knights' combat may feel stripped down, but it still provides some of the best melee combat on the market. Gotham City has plenty of crimes to solve and challenges to get through. It's just a shame some of its traversals can be so bothersome.","Gotham Knights is a messy, directionless open-world RPG that doesn’t know what it wants to be. Its lack of identity means that, just like its heroes, it fails to step out of the shadows and truly shine.",,"Gotham Knights continues the legacy of the Arkham Saga with a standalone adventure filled with action, mystery, drama, and emotional moments; but one that fails to carry its weight. The beginnings of Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin and Red Hood are not perfect, but there is still hope.","Gameplay-wise, Gotham Knights contains good ideas, but in practice it’s mostly repetitive. The puzzles are trivial, and the Batcycle feels as nimble as a belt sander over a slab of wood. Even the fights only require the press of a single button. In short: Batman, may you rest in peace. You deserve better than this.",,,,"Gotham Knights is a proper super hero open world game. Its story, gameplay and in general experience, were a great return to a Batman game.","There’s an argument to be made, I guess, that if you stop thinking about it as a Batman game and just judge it on its own merits, it’s not half-bad – but even if you do that, you’re still left with the reality that the game that doesn’t come anywhere near matching up to what the genre is capable of. This is a mediocre game through and through, and Batman branding or no, it’s not really worth your time.",,"Gotham Knights may not be the Arkham follow-up players were expecting. Yet it is an admirable addition to the Batman universe, striving to forge a path of its own. Multiplayer fuels the experience, allowing for seamless crimefighting with a friend. Growing pains may exist with loot, crafting, and progression but it balances out in harder difficulties that reward calculated play and thoughtful tactics. While some may be lost without Bats, this family has found a way to survive.",,"There's a compelling game in Gotham Knights, but it's hidden away behind a messy UX, needless crafting and customization systems, and combat mechanics that have been stretched paper thin to accommodate four heroes. I do believe that WB Games Montreal is capable of greatness, but this isn't the game that Gotham deserves after the death of Bruce Wayne, and it's not the one it needs right now following Rocksteady's retreat to Metropolis for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.","As the latest burger off the production line, Gotham Knights is fine. It ticks all the boxes, name-drops all the right characters, has the right voice actors, and is a big, expensive project that looks and plays like it should. At the end of the day, though, you’re still eating a greasy burger with no nutritional value whatsoever. While it’s fine to say “yeah but sometimes that’s fun,” there is a point where we need to acknowledge that this is all some people eat. That’s not healthy and I, for one, am sick of superhero nonsense being such a vacuum of talent producing such mindless output, when the games industry (and Hollywood) could be doing so much more.","Despite the cumbersome gear system and its repetitive combat elements, Gotham Knights largely succeeds as a unique, story-driven adventure that sells the vigilante experience. Its story of a Bat Family in crisis is undoubtedly the highlight, but the game also deserves praise for its open-world presentation, co-op, and detective-based approach to unraveling Gotham's many mysteries.",,"Gotham Knights steps out of Arkham’s shadow to provide a great super hero game full of excellent characters. While some of this shine is dampened by inconsistent console performance, it’s gaming’s best take on Gotham that we couldn’t stop exploring.","Gotham Knights is an enjoyable experience led by Bat Girl, Robin, Red Hood and Nightwing, a bunch of heroes that fight together both as a homage to Batman and as a way to keep his legacy alive. The city where the games take place is full of big corporations, criminals and many, many secrets. If you are a fan of open world games and of the superhero theme, Gotham Knights definitely deserves a chance.","Did Batman’s mentees manage to carry on without him? They did, buy he would’ve coped better. Gotham Knights has its moments, but its not as fun as Rocksteady’s gems and fails to hit the visual quality I expect from a PS5 game despite running at 30 fps. WB Games Montréal delivered a decent title that satisfies the hunger for adventures set in the DC Universe, but I had the feeling the developers didn’t even try to beat the Arkham series.",,,,,"Gotham Knights ends up being a pretty mediocre experience. The combat is decent, but not varied or tight enough. The story has its ups and downs, with a couple of very strange choices. The visuals are good, but the performance is not up to par, with severe frame drops happening too often.","In case I hadn’t made it clear already, I really didn’t like Gotham Knights. It lacks the speed, flow and character of previous Batman games, and its action-oriented gameplay is hamstrung by the 30 FPS lock. It became such an exercise in boredom that I couldn’t bring myself to continue playing — and because I didn’t finish, I’m leaving a score off the end of this review.","While it does attempt to carve out its own identity with its slower pace and more intimate storytelling, it’s hard to separate this game from the Batman games of the past. But regardless of its lack of originality, Gotham Knights remains a compelling experience – one littered with intriguing and thoughtful interpretations of characters, and a creeping sense of dread that will keep you rushing through case files, determined to save Gotham from itself.","Perhaps you could argue that the streets of Gotham feel a little empty at times, or that when facing off against a large number of enemies, the combat gets a little messy, but it’s hard to truly find fault with Gotham Knights. It’s an immensely enjoyable adventure from beginning to end, with lots to offer to Batman fans even though they don’t get to play as the caped crusader himself. Don’t let the lack of a performance mode put you off: with stunning visuals, varied gameplay and great online co-op, Gotham Knights is one of the best games of the year.",,,"There's a lot to love about Gotham Knights, especially when fighting or traversing the city, but a few hiccups do hold it back.",,"Gotham Knights is a good game dragged down by a few mechanics that feel a little out of place. The story, characters, and gameplay is really fun, strengthened by a great-looking open world, and tons of stuff to do. The fact that you'll need to do all of it in 30 fps is a big problem though, although some co-op makes up for it a little.","Gotham Knights doesn't know what game wants to be. It has the narrative and structure of a single player game... But also lackluster RPG elements that doesn't add anything to the formula and infinite, repeatable objectives like a MMO. It's not a bad game and we actually had fun with our time with it, but it lacks... something. And it's not Batman.","Gotham Knights is bold and brave. It removes the leading character of the universe in order to focus on those who are often pushed aside. The treatment of the new team is fantastic and as a result, WB Montreal has found new figureheads. While the combat differs from Arkham, it’s still a brilliant system that successfully evolves the formula with performance-based abilities. Some missions are repetitive and traversal lacks the speed and ferocity of the combat. However, the game is a joy to play and perfectly captures the birth and growth of a new band of bats.",,"Gotham Knights is a beautiful game that tells an amazing story. Fans of Batman and Arkham Knights will definitely like what they see. Still, the game’s over-reliance on grapple and grind can wear thin, even with a terrific nightly progression system that advances main and side missions wonderfully. Final judgment should be reserved for robust multiplayer inclusion, however.","Gotham Knights is hampered by a marketing that did not distance it enough from the Arkham series, being a totally different universe that can’t be compared. It has good combat, especially when co-op, and a fun, comic book-style campaign. However, the lack of creativity in some points, activities that look the same and the refinement in general prevent the title from shining more.",,"Gotham Knights would be a great game, its sandbox approach to exploring Gotham is top-notch and its story keeps you just engaged enough to keep playing. The problem lies in the game’s lackluster combat and endless fighting cycles of beating up the same factions over and over and over with little to no variation to dialogue.","You can't deny Gotham Knights is a spectacle, provides high octane action, and an interesting storyline. It doesn't work great all the way through, but not every game has to be a complex, mindblowing experience. Sometimes accessibility is where all the fun is.","Gotham Knights is filled to the brim with character and nods to the Bat-Family. While the locked-in 30 FPS might be a dealbreaker for some, the flawless co-op experience Gotham Knights provides is an amazing time for those who want to fight crime with friends. A fully immersive Gotham City for you to travel in your way, either straight through the story, or complete every side mission you can; your time in Gotham is up to you.","Gotham Knights stands in the shadow of giants, and while it doesn't necessarily stand as an equal, it's a valiant effort. There's clearly a lot of love and care put into the game, and while it doesn't hit every mark, it hits more than it misses. The only thing that really drags it down are some technical issues and a slight drought of unique open-world content to complete. It's a great attempt to figure out how you do Batman without Batman, and this title should scratch the itch of any Batman fan.","Gotham Knights strings together weird design choices. Whether it be the open world, the combat system or even the co-op: it's all just not fleshed out enough. The potential is there for those willing to dig deeper into this batsoup. But it shouldn't be necessary to dig this deep for highlights. Gotham Knights is the superhero game we deserve yet need.",,"Gotham Knights is both something different and something familiar for Batman fans. While the new role-playing elements create some pacing issues throughout the story, the breadth of abilities and ease of progression stop the experience from being as tedious as it could have been.",,"Gotham Knights obviously suffers from its difficult development, which buries a thoroughly fun core under many problems.",,"Gotham Knights is a pretty good experience, especially for those who like superheroes and are familiar with Batman and the other characters. The gameplay is well-developed and the fact that you have four playable heroes, each with unique combat and movement skills, makes it fun. On the other side, though, it has some technical issues, mainly frame rate drops, that are disappointing.","Gotham Knights isn’t really broken, it simply falls short of what has come before. Superhero games come with lofty expectations these days, and it’s unlikely this entry will meet them for most players. It’s safely skippable for now, but maybe check it out once it arrives on your favourite subscription service.","In many ways, Gotham Knights is a game that does everything differently from the previous Arkham games, and maybe this is the reason why so many people seem disappointed. An open-world Gotham City, four members of the Batman family to defend civilians, lots of puzzles to solve, and so on, all are part of a package that takes time to discover and which kind of grows on you the more time you give it. Sure, it’s hard to ignore the clunky controls, the performance glitches, and the graphics that need more polishing, but otherwise, there’s a good chance you’ll have a lot of fun playing Gotham Knights.","Gotham Knights is one of those games with a lot of potential that is spoiled by a bunch of questionable game design choices. Without being fundamentally bad, Gotham Knights leaves us with the sensation of an abandoned service game that could have been promising if it was assumed. A game fun to play in cooperation that will remain in the shadow of Batman Arkham.",,,,"Gotham Knights is the type of game you so dearly want to love, but time and time again it gives you a reason not to. What Warner Bros. Games Montreal has here is an excellent story with top-notch cutscene direction and a fun combat system, with too many needless and confusing mechanics bolted on top. If you can look past them, there's a genuinely great game here. We recommend trying your best to do so; you'll find a compelling narrative on the other side.","Gotham Knights narrate a very entertaining story with a well-written and endearing quartet of heroes. Its game mechanics work best when it stays linear. However, its open world makes the experience decline with how repetitive it becomes.","An average city action that can't be broken even by competent fights and an interesting story with a unique villain. Gotham Knights is a time killer with boring activities in a pathetically dead city, terrible controls, wasted potential and a lackluster graphical presentation. The game feels like the work of tie-breakers who have to look up the word ""fun"" in the dictionary.",,"Simultaneously better and worse than you’d expect, with some fun co-op and detective elements but weak combat and muddled storytelling.","Gotham Knights, orphan of the iconic figure of Batman, takes up the torch with panache. Our heroes honor the Dark Knight for an exhilarating adventure inspired by comic books. The city of Gotham, darker than ever, the technical and nervous fights, and the complementarity of the four vigilantes blow a breath of super-heroic freshness on the universe of Batman. Without being perfect with its camera flaws and sometimes redundant missions, the Warner Games title hits hard and proves that Batman is not the only hero worthy of the name in Gotham.",,"Gotham Knights wants you to sympathize with Red Hood, but the game doesn’t do enough to contextualize his existential crisis, and we never see him evolve. He’s just the same angry brute doing the same thing over and over again, mashing that square button like the rest of us...Terrible combat, unnecessary RPG systems, a half-baked ending, and miserable Jason Todd leave very little to enjoy in Gotham Knights. Surely this is not what Bruce Wayne wanted for Gotham.","Gotham Knights has a few interesting things going on. It’s just not enough to elevate it to the level of previous Batman games. Now, sure, technically speaking, this isn’t truly a Batman game, as the focus is on his legacy of proteges. But the Arkham series of games has elevated expectations quite high, and while Gotham Knights didn’t hit them, it has moments where it does feel like something interesting is brewing. With more to do in the city, and an easier method of switching characters, perhaps this could be the start of something greater.","A lot has been riding on Gotham Knights' shoulders but the wait has paid off dividends. Performance issues aside, its gripping story and gorgeous open-world enforce it as a confident successor to the Arkham franchise. Gotham Knights is a robust co-op adventure that embraces the Dark Knight's world wholeheartedly.",With Gotham Knights WB Games Montreal delivers a pretty decent and enjoyable action game with structural and balance issues that result in a mere distant echo of Rocksteady's Arkham series.,,,"We had placed a lot of hope in this Gotham Knights. The adventure was pleasant but too imperfect, interesting but not legendary enough; especially for a license around the Dark Knight, even without him in the title role. Too bad then. It is therefore high time for him to come back, and in the most beautiful way.","Gotham Knights is a lacklustre entry into the Batman mythos that feels like a major step back from what has come before. Whether it's the monotonous combat, subpar 30fps on console, lack of co-op incentives and strain it puts on the single-player experience or the fact that Gotham is dull and slow to explore, nothing justifies its existence. While its story might offer the occasional glimpse of something that could have been, it gives me no great pleasure in saying that Gotham Knights is my biggest disappointment of the year.","Don’t expect a successor to Arkham, slavish to the memory of Rocksteady’s games. This 6 isn’t that. It is a good game in its own right, despite some mistakes. [Issue#21, p.74]",,,,,,,But Gotham Knights is lacking some of the interpretive moves that made both Rocksteady’s Arkham games and WB Games Montreal’s own Arkham Origins so fascinating and unique. It’s yet another encounter on the same rain-soaked streets.,"Warner Bros. Montreal took a giant risk with Gotham Knights. Not only did the studio choose to forgo using one of the world’s most famous heroes, but also the top-rated Arkham series. What we have with Gotham Knights is an original setup filled with a great central cast and an intriguing tale of young sidekicks uncovering Gotham’s dark secrets and becoming knights themselves.","There are plenty of moments in Gotham Knights that make for a good time - the camaraderie between the heroes is enjoyable, and the city itself looks great. However, the combat is too basic and monotonous to stand on its own, and the story struggles to get going before it falls apart.","Gotham Knights is a game that we've had fun with, but it's also frustrated us. Its main story is entertaining, the few secondary villains are a great attraction, it is full of references that DC fans will fall in love with, and the construction of the superheroes and the relationship between them is one of the best points of the title. However, it wants to be two things at once, without being brilliant at either of them.","Gotham Knights does a spectacular job of creating a world that’s fun to explore and learn more about, but not without its technical faults.","With Batman dead, his four proteges have big boots to fill in Gotham Knights. Thankfully Warner Bros. Montreal has largely pulled it off, creating a Gotham City that's filled with things to do, and letting the four characters' contrasting styles show in combat and their personalities come through in the story.",,,"A worthwhile entry into the DC/Batman game series, Gotham Knights can be a fun experience in single-player or co-op with its strengths lying in variety and its four-Knight team. However, its confusing UI, repetitive stripped-back combat, and lack of stealth options leave it unable to reach the glorious heights of the Arkham games.","Gotham Knights' insistence on being a modern open world RPG leads to some gameplay issues and painfully generic mechanics, but there's a lot of fun to be had here nonetheless, and an engaging story to experience. It may not be Arkham, but it's good enough in its own right.",,"Gotham Knights offers an open world-based action RPG experience that will drive fans of DC characters crazy, while resting on controversial narrative assumptions: there are two videogame universes at Warner Bros., but in none of them Batman is alive. Once this obstacle has been overcome, the story turns out to be enjoyable and the characters well written, the combat system is a derivative of freeflow focused on the skills and peculiarities of the individual heroes, the cooperative has fun but does not appear essential. There are many enemies and excellent boss fights, within a structure that in terms of activities appears rather traditional but rich in content. Visually, the game is a spectacle but when it moves it staggers, betraying a series of technical choices that to define questionable is little: what a pity.","Gotham Knights is Warner Bros Games' experiment to also bring DC superheroes to open world RPG territory. Given the legacy of the glorious Arkham series, however, the result is a fairly controversial work: a digital playground for those who live off Batman comics and a good diversification system for the four playable heroes do not fully justify a formula in which the quantity dominates quality. The open world that acts as a theater for the adventures of Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin and Red Hood is traditional and repetitive, while the role-playing inspiration - however stimulating in terms of progression - becomes too overwhelming for the narrative and playful rhythm of the production. In general, the major divergences from the Arkham epic are in part the main limitation of the work. While having fun, the Gotham Knights still don't seem to be at the level of their mentor.",,,,,,"While it is kept back by plain side activities and poor grinding mechanisms, Gotham Knights does manage to win over the player through its well told main story, the interesting gameplay variation between the four characters and its highly entertaining co-op mode.",,,"Look, if you want to jump around and punch people, there are hundreds of other games. If you’re really keen to play a DC action game, featuring a modern and admittedly brave step away from the big black bat, then Gotham Knights is fine enough. It’s just that in the shadow of former Batman titles, in the shadow of Batman himself, it doesn’t impress. It disappoints.",,,"We can only recommend the game to extreme fans of the Batman/Gotham universe as well as people who have this as their first PlayStation 5 game because once you start any other game and see 60fps with good controls, Gotham Knights will be instantly forgotten.",,"The outer layers of Gotham Knights present quite well and will keep you entertained for hours, but there’s something rotting at the core that holds the game back from ever being anything great.",,,"Gotham Knights is a game that draws its line in the sand very early on and rarely wavers. It is a game that emphasizes the importance of support and empathy while sprinkling in every element we've come to expect and adore from these titles along the way. So no, Gotham Knights is not an Arkham game. It neither needed nor wanted to be. And because of this, it thrives.","Gotham Knights is worth playing for its story and characters, but its RPG stylings feel counterintuitive and clunky compared to the Arkham games.",,,"A production that hits the hearts of comic fans as unerringly as Arrow's arrow is overshadowed by an extremely flat combat system, inappropriate design decisions and outdated technology.",,,,"Gotham Knights has good ideas, unfortunately, never reaches its true potential. The combat is fun, but feels less agile than previous Batman games. Also, the open world is full of repetitive missions and the RPG elements are insignificant. However, we had fun with the story, charismatic characters and playing with each hero.","Gotham Knights is a dense and mostly enthralling action RPG with a competent (if predictable) story and the best Gotham City ever seen in a videogame. From a technical standpoint there are some annoying performance issues, and it doesn't look like the game was really meant to be next-gen, but the gameplay is solid and playing in co-op with a friend it's definitely an experience worth trying.",,"Gotham Knights didn’t wow me with its overly familiar objectives, combat, and activities, but it didn’t leave me sour. It’s fun to control some new heroes as they brood over Gotham from its building overhangs and uncover hidden plots against its people. Those heroes are right to wonder if they’re living up to a vaunted legacy. And even if they’re not quite up to snuff, Gotham has enough baddies to punch to make for a good time, whoever you are.",,,,"Gotham Knights is a strange beast: it's the classic example of a result greater than the sum of its parts. Taken individually, the elements that make up the latest effort by WB Games Montréal are full of many small critical issues, yet a video game is the product of the meeting and fusion of these individual parts. Yes, that's right, there are a lot of problems, almost all related to open world management and bland RPG components, but overall the game works and is capable of delivering one of the best Batman and companions stories outside the world of comics.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Gotham Knights sets itself apart from the Arkham series in all the wrong ways, leaving players with a disappointing action-RPG that’s in desperate need of refinement.",,,"Ultimately, I enjoyed Gotham Knights for what it was – a basic superhero game that provides players with plenty to do. It will not live up to the standard of the height of the Batman: Arkham series, but it's still a fun game, especially if you want to just tune out and beat up some nameless thugs. There is plenty of room for improvement in Gotham Knights, but this game provides a solid enough foundation for future installments, and I enjoyed a game that looked at the wider Batman family rather than focusing on just one character.",,"Gotham Knights is a surprising game. On the surface, it looks like a lesser knockoff of the Batman games that came before, but underneath that rough exterior is a well-crafted action RPG with outstanding co-op, engaging characters, and a story worth taking time to enjoy.",,"A diamond in the rough, Gotham Knights is a blast but feels like it could do with a little more polish. Gotham Knights’ vision of Gotham is compelling and filled with charismatic characters you’re going to want to spend time with. There’s almost too much to do here, but you’ll probably be too busy battering goons to care.",,,,"But all these unforced errors are being applied to a framework that’s so solid that it’s still hard not to have fun with it for a decent proportion of the time. The worst thing you can say about the game, really, is that in reviewing it, I’ve been unable to avoid mentioning what’s ostensibly a whole separate series of video games in pretty much every paragraph. That’s how beholden the good in Gotham Knights is to Rocksteady’s work—but that good is still present, nevertheless.","I enjoyed my time with these heroes, villains, and this beautiful world. But I am hesitant to return or recommend it, given the choppy framerate and sluggish combat. If you can overlook, you will find an enjoyable open world action game, with moments of levity and wholesomeness. While Batman himself may be dead, it felt great to play in the spandex and capes of his proteges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gotham Knights is up there with Elden Ring as a Game of the Year contender. Its fast, responsive, and action-packed combat is surpassed only by a narrative that had me glued from the very first cutscene. A must-play for fans of open-world titles, and an easy pickup for anyone invested with the Gotham Knights or DC Universe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
goat-simulator-3,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Goat Simulator 3 isn’t exactly ripping up the thin rule book its predecessor scribbled out, but it recaptures the stupid anarchic joy and amplifies its influence across a bigger, better game world.",,,,,,,,"In short, if you enjoyed the original and want to take that to larger proportions, it is clear that you are going to like it, however simple its humor is and also its graphical performance. It is totally a satire made into a video game, and if we are honest, it fulfills its function of entertaining. It's not a GOTY at all, and I don't think it wants to be.",,,,,"Coffee Stain goes big but remains shallow for Goat Simulator 3. A more ambitious sandbox and impressive customisation options aside, this is still the same gag about a weak-kneed farm animal, with a punchline that ultimately outstays its welcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Goat Simulator 3 is ridiculous, but it's so much fun that it's hard to not recommend, thanks to crazy missions and enjoyable gameplay.","Of course, all of that chaos leaves the game vulnerable to some seismic bugs. It is no shock that the first option on the pause menu is an automatic respawn, because it is quite easy to banjax yourself. (Once, I fell through the bottom of the world and into a strange, psychedelic nether-realm.) Perhaps this is part of the deal, in a game this manic. Goat Simulator 3 has no aspirations beyond what it is: a dishevelled yet appealing bender of self-destructive looniness.",,,,,,"Goat Simulator 3 is full of unfunny jokes, several once-funny exaggerations, and pretty obvious references. Underneath all this mess, we have an interesting gameplay. But still, Goat Simulator 3 is basically an open world game made entirely of bad sidequests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Goat Simulator 3 is the sequel you would expect with mostly more of the same. Hilarious gameplay, fun references and an entertaining single player make this a game definitely worth a try. Technically, however, it's not perfect and could have been a little better, but don't let that stop you from getting started with the goat!",,"For what it is, Goat Simulator 3 excels. It's a bigger, crazier sequel to the viral hit, built expressly to satiate anyone's appetite for chaos. It's the epitome of dumb fun; if you want to switch your brain off and just mess around for an hour or so, this is about as lowbrow as it gets, and we mean that as a compliment. There are some serious performance hiccups, and it's certainly not to everyone's tastes. Even if you love it, the novelty will eventually run dry, but if you're able to go along for the ride and lean into its madness, you'll have lots of fun while it lasts.","Goat Simulator 3 is an entertaining title that constantly gives you new things to do. Despite its simplicity, it grants you many fun moments you can enjoy with someone else. Unfortunately, its technical section affects the experience quite a bit.",,,"Being closer to a traditional video game does more harm than good, in a game that is all too proficient at making anarchic mayhem seem boring.",,,,,,,,,"As funny as the first episode, even more, Goat Simulator 3 improves the initial concept thanks to a larger open world and somes real nice side quests. Spending a few hours discovering all the secrets (and the easter eggs from the pop culture) of this sandbox is therefore pleasant and often very funny. But the game still has its limits and its concept of joke is still sold between 30 and 40 euros.",,,,,,,,,,"When all is said and done, Goat Simulator 3 is a solid playground to have fun in and just be the worst goat possible. There’s tons of items to find, toys to unwrap and secrets to find. It’s a well-made silly thing to follow up a joke that went too far. Even after the credits roll, it’ll still be fun to try out new ideas to see what will work and what else is hidden. Even as I am writing this, I’ve thought of a couple of things that I’m going to want to do just to see if anything happens. Based on the rest of the game, the answer is probably yes. That alone shows that the spirit of the original has been captured while still being a more complete experience. Even the bugs, and admittedly crusty references, can be ignored when there is just so much fun to be had.",,This is like a playable joke that is fun for a while… but gets repetitive too soon.,,,,,"Goat Simulator 3 nails the ridiculousness in a bigger, more intuitive way. The humour hits in every corner of the huge open world you’ll be exploring, culminating in hours of fun. The controls not feeling as modern as its peers, alongside small performance issues dampen the overall package, but if you’re looking for something truly off the wall and friendly for all ages, this game is one to check out.",,,"Goat Simulator 3 does everything it is supposed to do, much better than the original. The missions give a nice progression to the adventure, and the cooperative multiplayer increases the fun you can get out of the game.","Goat Simulator 3 is an ode to unbridled fun, a jumble of easter eggs, absurd and ""deliberate idiocy"", capable of giving healthy entertainment to all those who choose to play the sheep once again. Thanks to simple but fun multiplayer activities and a pool of weapons and cosmetic items to be collected, clearly to wreak havoc on the town at the center of the experience, the game of Coffee Stain knows how to give smiles and surprise, with its repetitive missions but guess what and the catastrophic consequences of the actions of this bleating goat and a little Dragonborn.",,,,,,,,,"This one game about an entitled goat does everything I wish the original Goat Simulator did and more. The goatfits, the whimsical joy of discovering a level like the Cellar of Doom, and witnessing just how much disarray one uncontrollable goat can cause will make Goat Simulator 3 one of the best co-op games to sit back and reset with. Watch this space, because me and Pilgor are quite the unstoppable duo – and this won’t be the last you see of us.",,,,"The open-world sandbox is so beautifully absurd, so funny, so broken that you just can't help but love this heap of dung that has become a game.","The team at Coffee Stain know exactly what the title is and how it should be played, cranking up the insanity for an outrageous time and optimum enjoyability. Goat Simulator 3 is pure absurdity, nothing more, nothing less.","Goat Simulator 3 is exactly what you expect from a game dedicated to celebrating parodies, exploring the weirdness of game physics, and running around the world as a “chaotic good” or “chaotic evil” goat. It can be a lot of fun! Sometimes, it can break! I still see pop-in issues after the day one patch and find myself getting stuck. Still, even when it isn’t perfect, it’s a good time. It manages to be irreverent, but simultaneously irrelevant and relevant.",,"Goat Simulator 3 is what you’d expect from a modern sequel.

But getting even deeper, it’s a reminder of simpler times, when just running around and making your own fun used to be more the du jour.",,,,"Despite the larger world and more tasks, the playground for explosive silliness only motivates in the short term. It gets more fun in co-op with up to four participants, but only with friends or online mistakes.",,"Let's be honest Goat Simulator 3 is not a game to be taken seriously, even the developers themselves say so. Regarding the first game, some improvements have been made such as online and local multiplayer, objectives have been added to the games and new abilities. It really amuses us a lot but once again it lacks a clear objective.",,,,,,,,,"Cunningly exploiting its own limitations among which the technical ones stand out, Goat Simulator 3 is perfect for single player or even better in co-op fooling around, has a lot of crazy customizations and proves that the devs have truly given their best - or the worst, it depends on the point of view - of themselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Goat Simulator 3 not only recaptures the crazy fun of the original, but it expands and improves on everything that came before, resulting in a big, stupid sandbox experience that made me smile from start to finish.",,,"It's not a deep or wide as some might want, as some of the missions (and gags) do wear thin, but it's still fun queuing up and just messing around in it. There's a sense that there are even more wild combinations to assert your power (or jump around as a shark on a skateboard), and the ability to even do that and scratch that itch in such a way is definitely worth checking out.

arkanoid-eternal-battle,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The marriage of Arkanoid with the Battle Royale concept is a welcome one and equally warmly received is the inclusion of the classic Arkanoid for older gamers or those who are inquisitive enough to reach back far into those halcyon days of arcade gaming. However, a distinct lack of modes and a seemingly lukewarm player base effectively cut the legs out from under Arkanoid: Eternal Battle's titular and marquee mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"That niggle aside though, we’re pleasantly surprised with Arkanoid: Eternal Battle. There have been many versions of Arkanoid (and other Breakout clones) over the years, but this might be one of our favourites. The Battle Royale format really does work, and the end-game boss mode is an unexpected but welcome twist. We’ll certainly be jumping back in again and again to chase those high scores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It is now a constant, with Arkanoid Eternal Battle, Pastagames offers a very nice reinvention of a great video game classic. Those who in their younger years broke bricks so that the little ship Vaus could carry out its mission will find their 1986 game as if they were in a game center, in addition to a Neo mode that brings enough novelties and good ideas to boost interest. Finally, the Battle Royale, a great novelty here, fits perfectly to Taito's cult title, especially when the whole is supported by visuals and electro-futuristic music of the best effect.",,,,"Outside of the online – which adopts a seasonal format and sees you unlocking new cosmetics as you work through the ranks – there’s a modernised version of single player Arkanoid which includes new power-ups and a combo system, as well as the 1986 original, both with online leaderboards. There’s also a rounds-based versus mode for four-person local multiplayer play. As a whole, the package is well executed, but with an asking price of £24.99/$29.99, it feels a little too light overall to overcome the sticker shock.",,,,,"Very respectful of the hit of yesteryear, Arkanoid Eternal Battle is adorned with a successful electro look and new mechanics that will delight fans of the genre. Uninhibited brick breaker, the Pastagames title has the good idea of integrating an ingenious Battle Royale mode, but also a single or multiplayer mode for long winter evenings. If the content could be more generous – if only in terms of rewards – the room for improvement is such that we come back to it regularly to improve our reflexes. A good little game that is just waiting for a large community to give full meaning to the Battle Royale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"What feels like the foundation for something ideally more substantial lying in wait, Arkanoid – Eternal Battle can only muster up a competent, but unimaginative, spin on the Taito classic in Battle Royale form. That’s not to say that its core mode doesn’t at least find a way to tempt you back for another round umpteen times over, but eventually the more you repeat its disappointingly shallow progression — and worst of all, its egregiously-difficult and frustrating final face-off — the more you feel your time is spent not cunningly plotting a course to victory, but instead merely wasted on a concept that should be better fleshed out. Eternal Battle is not without good ideas in spots, and while the effort on bringing another retro classic into the BR fold is appreciated, it’s far from the most emergent or compelling of takes in the sub-genre.",,,,,,,,,,,"Arkanoid: Eternal Battle saves itself in the corner thanks to a series of ancillary methods which, between classicism and modernity, know how to pay homage in an at least dignified way to a work that has made the history of the medium. As for its battle royale heart, unfortunately, it must be noted that it has a certain difficulty in pulsating, too inconsistent and frequented by the community to justify, on its own, a ticket price that is not so low.","Arkanoid is a legend that never dies, but its take on the battle royale formula is plagued by some inconsistencies that make the game not as compelling as it could have been.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s a shame that a game that was already delayed once for further polishing still came out so rough. The constant frame drops, screen tears, glitches, and poor animation rendering are only the cherry on top of inconsistent puzzles and terrible lighting.

The NCAA teams are a good addition as well as confidently implemented PS5 haptics. That said, if you hate American Football, this likely isn't your thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Madden NFL 22 is a solid entry in the sports franchise, however, it lacks innovation and doesn't feel like a truly next-gen experience like many would hope it does.",,,"Madden NFL 22 has some good parts to it, mainly the usual suspects, but falls flat with Face of the Franchise. I know Face of the Franchise is a key part of Madden’s success and what fans look forward to as a main piece of the Madden pie each year, but honestly, it has so many glitches in it that at times it is unplayable. Could these be fixed, and this year’s title saved? Most definitely, but as it stands at launch, the game has issues that need rectifying.","With those yearly grievances aired, Madden NFL 22 is still a worthwhile pickup if you were on the fence. There's nothing that's painstakingly new in this year's release. However, next-gen technology elevates gameplay with more realistic player movements, while home field advantage is, finally, exactly that. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go draft Tim Tebow as my starting tight end.",,,"As a whole, Madden 22 takes several solid steps in the right direction with very few stumbles backward. The straddling of console generations and lack of certain updates at launch make the game feel like it's only halfway to its full potential, but it still makes for an enjoyable entry for new players and current fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,"If you have Madden NFL 21, the changes here might not be enough for you to consider parting with your hard-earned cash for Madden NFL 22. It is undoubtedly a better game than last year’s version, so if you’re an ardent fan you’ll probably do so anyway. Gameday atmosphere successfully adds to the ambience from one match to the next, while the new momentum system adds a nice tug-of-war element as players fight for helpful perks. It’s just a shame that outside of Franchise mode there are few developments worthy of note, while Face of the Franchise seriously needs some work. Also, I want a proper story mode back again, EA. I miss Longshot.",,,,,,,,,"A small yet valiant leap forward, PS5 Madden remains a snazzy if still somewhat flawed gridiron offering.",,,,,,"I always find a message within the selection of the Madden cover athlete, and in the picks of Tom Brady (arguably the greatest quarterback of all time) and Patrick Mahomes (arguably the most naturally gifted QB of all time), the message felt like a dual nod to Madden's age and enduring legacy as well as the promise of a bright future. However, even with the new stuff, I can't shake the sense of sameness in the experience of Madden NFL 22. The love of football keeps me playing, but there were no moments that made me think, ""OK, we are in the next generation."" That holds the series back while other games have passed it by. It looks like another year where ""the leap"" will have to wait — if it ever comes at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,"A new year, a new part, but it is not really groundbreaking. The game has too few innovations and improvements compared to the previous part and the game also suffers from technical defects. In addition, the performance isn’t optimal on PS5. But credits where credit’s due, the improved Franchise mode is a great step forward, but corrupt savefiles are a shame though.",,"Madden NFL 22 takes big strides forward from last year’s game, with the focus on Franchise being overdue but appreciated all the same. We like the direction EA Sports has taken this year, with even the new Gameday Momentum system adding immersion to every individual match. Face of the Franchise still falls flat, and patches will need to be applied to the way deep coverages work. But some irritating bugs and glitches aside, it feels like this series is at least on the right trajectory at last.","The addition of the momentum bar gives a new gaming experience to Madden NFL 22, but it's not an adjustment attractive enough to think EA Tiburon did a solid job. Graphically we have a game worthy of the next generation of consoles, but in practice it fails. It's time to offer a title with better physics instead of default animations.",,,"There’s some mild improvement on last year’s game but the Madden franchise still feels lost, with too little depth and too many bugs.","If we have to compare Madden NFL 22 to one of the two quarterbacks on its cover, the latter is more Tom Brady than Patrick Mahomes: he becomes thinner and more complete over time, but still idles like his last years. The game is running out of steam from a technical point of view, and the difference between the next-gen and the PS4 / ONE versions is not so obvious on the visual, especially as the online and solo bugs are still also common. On the other hand, Madden does not fall into the trap that made Opus 21 a failure, namely to give a second youth to Franchise and Career modes via cool additions (Momentums, coaching staff talent tree ... ). For the rest, we will wait for the real ""slap"" episode that the new generation of consoles deserves in the years to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The gameplay is still far from perfect, and I’d be interested to see how FIFA develops its machine-learning AI and if that would be accessible for Madden in the future. Hits can be brutally nasty using the Hit Stick and seeing different tackles, catches or sack-evading animations will leave you impressed.",,"This year’s Madden is a lot of fun and adds some nice gameplay features, but as a series it needs a big push to keep us engaged outside Ultimate Team and Franchise.",,,"Madden NFL 22 is meant to deliver a simulated and engaging experience to fans of football. Its animations are great, and you’ll likely only gravitate to one mode that you prefer over the others, but it all acts as a way for fans to connect, and sometimes a rare glitch won’t impact that. There’s a lot of demand for some growth of the series, and this game has a long way to go, it seems, but seeing my dad pick up a gaming controller for the first time in years and can’t be overlooked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Some things are better, some things are the same, some things are still broken; it’s a guessing game each year what will be up or down, and in the end, it all ends up at the same result: a passable but uninspired football simulation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Madden 22 is not a huge step forward in a series that needs to shift gears to return to its former glory. There is no shortage of interesting ideas, too bad that there are quite a few gameplay issues and that some game modes (Face to the Franchise, for example) are way too boring and uninteresting.",,,,,,,,"Improvements and additions are scarce with Madden 22, it all makes it for an average game unworthy of next gen consoles.",,,,,"When everything's working as intended, Madden 22 marks a recent high point for the series. The gameplay doesn't move the needle much mechanically, but changes to the AI make for a more interesting and varied challenge, while Gameday Atmosphere and Momentum brings every team's fans to life to palpable effect. With Franchise making the moments between these games more engaging, it's relatively easy to sink hours into building a team to challenge for the Super Bowl. It's just unfortunate that this comes with the caveat that technical problems might prove to be the biggest obstacle standing in your way.",,"For every enjoyable new thing in Madden NFL 22, there's something else that's equally as frustrating. The real saving grace that makes the game a solid experience is the upgraded gameplay and graphics for next-gen. If you like Madden, you'll have fun, even if you get annoyed from time to time, but the franchise still has a long way to go if it wants to catch up with the other sports games on the market.","Let’s be realistic. For an annual sports franchise, it’s not necessarily practical to expect huge evolution year on year. It’s also fair to say that at a minimum, players should expect EA to deliver incremental quality of life improvements and make an effort to hone their overall experience of the game for the better. Whilst there is only so far the needle can be pushed year on year, the launch of a new Madden on next-gen systems presented EA with an opportunity to really raise the bar. That’s why it’s particularly disappointing that Madden 22 only offers stagnant content and, sadly, creative disinterest.",,,"Madden is as compelling as it ever was, but it can’t escape the slight feeling that things are spread a little too thin. Improvements to franchise mode are welcome and help the experience, but they are smaller than perhaps they deserve. With so many different ways to play football, it’s a little difficult to get in invested in any one game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"You can certainly have fun with Madden NFL 2022, but overall the changes over 2021 feel incremental at best and show more potential than they actually deliver. My wish list for 2023 would be an NFL game that gets me as pumped-up to play it as I feel on game day, one that has an AI that actually reacts and adapts to my play-calling, and one that has animations as fluid as the real thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
destroy-all-humans!-2---reprobed,,,,,,,"Like the story that sets in the 60s, it seems that the developers’ mindset is also stuck back then, as none of the gameplay mechanisms are upgraded to meet today’s standards in this supposedly remade title.","Whether you're coming to Destroy All Humans 2!: Reprobed fresh or as a fan of the original release, there's a lot to like about this package. The work that's gone into remaking the game's locales and assets has been really well done. Whilst it can definitely feel like a game showing its age, the writing remains funny and the gameplay is fun. Multiplayer is hampered by keeping it local and I do find the boss fights go against the game's brisk pace. Still, it's a surprise to me that this can hold up after so long.",,"Destroy All Humans! 2: Reprobed is another great remake-sequel, and it is a sign that we need to support THQ Nordic more. Who knows, we might even get a full-on sequel in time!",,,"Destroy All Humans! 2: Reprobed might be a brutally honest remake of the original game, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant to sit through all its rough parts. Few elements of the core gameplay remain as fun as they were on the PS2, but it's far too shallow to be worth it, especially when it is still riddled with performance issues that can seriously effect your experience.",,,,,,,,,,,"Destroy All Humans! 2: Reprobed is a fine remake of a largely unnoteworthy game. Amounting to what is ostensibly more of the same, fans of the original or even 2020’s remake will probably be able to extract some fun for a few hours. Everyone else should probably just check out or replay through the original Destroy All Humans! And its 2020 remake, as it’s by far the better experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you enjoyed 2020’s Destroy All Humans! remake and want more outrageous exploits with Crypto, you’ll be very happy with Destroy All Humans! 2 – Reprobed. It’s a continuation of the tried and tested gameplay – for better or worse – but with more weapons and bigger, more varied environments. We can’t help but wish that Crypto was treated to a new outing though, one with revised controls and mechanics. These remakes are entertaining enough, but with one foot in the past, Crypto just can’t fulfil his potential.","Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed looks and sounds great, like a well-made game from 2022 should. The issues start to arise with the gameplay. Open world maps feel small, missions are short, and the story lacks depth. I never hated my time spent with Reprobed; it started as pushing a pea up a hill but felt like heaving a boulder up a mountain by the end. There are times when I like to think back to being a 13-year-old boy who finds fart jokes amusing; you just don’t see games with the same raunchiness to them as you did back in my youth Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed has kept that level of humor, for better or worse.","Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed is sure to be a nostalgic blast from the past for any fans of the original game and series, although given its buggy state, it might be worth waiting to see if a patch can add some much-needed fixes before you dive in - it’s not currently the love letter it aims to be.","Destroy All Humans 2! - Reprobed is a chaos-induced joyride through various cities on Earth, using plenty of weapons to get the job done. Some of the humour feels outdated, but there's no denying the fun to be had causing tons of destruction.",,,,"Destroy All Humans! 2 Reprobed is not hard to recommend for gamers who missed it the first time around, or remember it fondly and want to play it again. It looks, sounds and controls like a current title, and most of the jokes hold up just fine. Not all the gameplay mechanics and mission designs feel that fresh anymore, and it can feel simplistic and repetitive against the backdrop of recent action games. Like the remake of the original Destroy All Humans!, it’s hard not to wish that Black Forest had gone further into actual reboot territory, because the narrative bones, characters, and style could be something special in a more open-world, contemporary game.","We don't know if it's a necessary remake or if someone asked for it, but since it's here, it's an enjoyable game. One of those that you can enjoy on a weekend when you don't feel like doing anything truly existential. The original is from 2006 and the passage of time is noticeable in terms of narrative and conceptual development; but on a technical level it is up to the new times.",,"Like its predecessor, Destroy All Humans! 2: Reprobed may not be a technical masterpiece or offer a thematic approach that appeals to all audiences. However, it is visually refined, it has a humorous narrative and offers simple and responsive mechanics, resulting in a fun game.",,,The new version of Destroy All Humans 2 is painfully mediocre that nevertheless manager to keep me entertained for a while.,,"Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed will appeal to fans of the original and a more niche audience that craves destruction without caring that the plot isn't too cohesive. Others who will be aficionados are players who like mayhem on foot rather than from a flying saucer and appreciate gameplay improvements, even if they make the title much easier. It's a fun experience for everyone who's willing to check it out, especially with the title's relatively low price point compared to many other PS5 games.",,,"When looking at the original release, Destroy All Humans 2! improved on its predecessor in almost every way. For the most part, this rings true with Reprobed, with the visual and mechanical overhaul bringing it into the modern scene. Still, the rough technical issues and poorly aged missions may have newcomers shying away.","Destroy All Humans 2: Reprobed is even more fun than the first remake with improved and colorful visuals, smooth gameplay and the same amazing sounds that we know and love. Some games don’t need to be improved but we sure are glad this one was.",,,"Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed is another remake of the Destroy All Humans! franchise. It's a pretty cool experience, the game has nice visuals and, of course, those funny lines we all love are there too. But, unfortunately, it has a lot of glitches and the gameplay does not shine.",,"Destroy All Humans! 2: Reprobed remains a good example about how a remake should look and feel. Although part of the PS2 era, the game has aged well, and it remains largely entertaining. The new elements do not feel out of place, but they also do not overhaul the game experience. If you loved the original, the remaster will be a pleasant stroll down memory lane. If you are a newcomer, I recommend starting with the remaster of the first game to understand the story and fully appreciate the evolution of the gameplay.",,,,,"It's apt that the character you play as in Destroy All Humans! 2: Reprobed is named Crypto. Like crypto, the game is an interesting idea on paper, but we don't really need it, we don't want to hear about it, it keeps crashing, and if you invest any money into it then you're probably going to end up with buyer's remorse.",,"A very good remake of the cult action-adventure game. Crypto's world is more beautiful than ever before, the environments grander and more imposing - as is the inevitable chaos and destruction that the alien hero brings about. Great to play and great to look at - but the game is dragged back by some technical issues.",,,"Those who had tasted the previous remake will be delighted to learn that Destroy All Humans 2 Reprobed corrects many shots: the experience is based on a funnier and denser narration, on a rich gameplay and an overall feeling more fluid, more modern. This is obviously due to the original game which, at the time in 2006, had been able to rise a level but the redesign work is also appreciable: the graphic aspect sometimes delivers some nice surprises, despite bugs and problems techniques to highlight. We had a frankly pleasant time and in its finality, this second adventure testifies to a very good mood to be devoured without moderation.",,,,"Whereas another kind of Crypto is making waves in the world, THQ’s is a welcome, nostalgic character that will take you on a literal mind-bending trip. If you can overlook the frustrating technical issues that try to mar your enjoyment throughout your Destroy All Humans! 2 – Reprobed! journey, then there’s a cracking game here to soak in! From start to finish, its story, characters, and satisfying gameplay reinforce that this remake lives up to expectations and delivers a stellar sandbox stay that doesn’t look out of place in 2022.",,,,,,"There’s some enjoyable fast-food gaming in here, but it’s buried beneath a painfully unfunny script and unambitious mission design. This ET should go home. [Issue#19, p.80]",,,,,,,,"Like many of the B-movies that inspired it, Destroy All Humans! 2 – Reprobed isn’t something that will be considered great by a general consensus, but does have a certain appeal to the right audience. The game makes many attempts at subtle and not-so-subtle innuendos and while the intention is humor, many of them fall flat. Not because they’re offensive, they just mostly go for the low hanging fruit which may have been more risque in 2006, but nowadays just doesn’t seem that creative. There are sections of enjoyable gameplay, but these moments come as part of a greater narrative that’s difficult to care about. Fans of low-budget sci-fi are clearly the target audience, and for those this will probably be a good time, but there are better options available for the rest of us.",,"This remake, just like its predecessor, is really fun, but do not expect anything particularly noteworthy beyond its graphical update.",,"Destroy All Humans 2 - Reprobed is a good-looking remake and certainly has its fun moments, but the repetitive missions of its predecessor remain, and there's a lot of bugs that need addressing. Crypto remains a fun protagonist and the gameplay is entertaining, but it feels this remake needed a bit more care.",,,"Crypto’s second return in Destroy All Humans! 2 Reprobed is another successful remake from Black Forest Games. A few technical issues and poorly aged mission designs aside, this irreverent, smartass alien still has plenty to offer the modern world with hilarious quips and hugely entertaining gameplay. Fire up your death rays, crack a joke at 1960s society, bust down that fourth wall – Cryptosperidium is back and he’s standing tall. Arkvoodle be praised!",,,"Destroy All Humans! 2 Reprobed is exactly what we expected it to be. A totally crazy action shooter title that follows in the footsteps of the remake of two years ago. A few has changed, something has been optimized and there remains the madness and the story of a saga that has been able to mark a generation and which still maintains its user base, welcoming even some new fans.",,"Despite a fun co-op mode, Reprobed it's just not enough for making us wanting more Destroy all Humans games, right now. This series needs to be refreshed from ground up in order to have something new to say and offer.",,,"Destroy All Humans! 2 – Reprobed is a really good game that doesn’t take itself seriously. In some ways, it’s a relic from another era, a reminder of how simple and fun games used to be; a time before the endless grind. Heck, there’s even couch multiplayer, once a standard feature in games that has slowly faded out over the years. Despite its heritage, Destroy All Humans! 2 – Reprobed feels and plays modern enough with refined controls, decent visuals, and enough over-the-top fun to easily overlook the few shortcomings.",,,,,,,,"For a remastered game which doesn't offer anything authentic by today's standards, ridden with bugs, framerate drops and repetitive missions, potentially you will have couple of hours of fun with Reprobed, until you find some other ways of entertainment.",,,,,"I highly recommend Destroy All Humans! 2 – Reprobed. While Reprobed left me feeling a bit empty because it is another exact one-to-one recreation, the new updates and additions as well as a beautifully recreated world gives me just enough trust that Black Forest Games is the team to resurrect the Furon Empire.",,"Destroy All Humans! 2 Reprobed is like a younger, more immature sibling of the original. Gameplay wise, it is bolder and more logically put together, but overall it lacks the comedic intelligence that the original presented. Sure, Destroy All Humans! wasn’t exactly an intellectual experience, but it did offer discussions on social commentary that had a lot to say about society as a whole and problems with 1950s America. It seems as though the developers spent more time on improving gameplay than they did on developing a script and story that would offer the same elements of satire and intellect as the first. Although the original was released in 2006, a very different time socially and politically, this remaster could have ironed out a number of the narrative problematic edges. Unfortunately, by sticking with the “nature and soul” of the original release, the world of Destroy All Humans! 2 Reprobed doesn’t quite feel right in this more progressive world of 2022.",,,,"Destroy All Humans! 2 – Reprobed has a notable improvement over the first remake of 2020. We will visit various parts of the world with much larger scenarios, where each one has its own theme. Weapons are still just as fun, with the ability to do double the mayhem with a friend in co-op. The only problem is that it gets to feel a bit repetitive.",,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’re expecting Destroy All Humans 2! – Reprobed to be more of a remaster of the original game than a remake, you’ll likely be happy with the results. The game looks great and feels extremely faithful to the time it was released. Those with nostalgia for the original will get what they need out of it. After finally spending some time with it, though, I can say confidently that this was only ever an okay game, featuring the same lack of content and empty areas that open-world games of that era were known for. Today's open-world games are better at creating an overall experience worth your time.",,,,,,,,,A glossy and streamlined remake of a cult classic faithfully updates the experience for modern audiences but struggles to make much of an impression nearly twenty years after the original release.,,,"Despite a handful of nitpicks, Destroy All Humans! 2 – Reprobed has been a fun trip down memory lane. This updated remake of the classic alien shooter doesn't bring a whole lot new to the table, and by modern open-world standards, it definitely feels dated in some areas. Still, if you're someone who grew up playing the original Destroy All Humans! 2 like I did, I'm hard-pressed to think that you won't have a good time coming back to this extraterrestrial adventure in 2022.",,,"Whilst the updated visuals and much improved control scheme are welcome touches, the cracks start to show quickly as it doesn’t do anything to improve on the PS2 original’s gameplay. However, this is still an easy one to recommend if you fancy something simple, but fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you can look past the occasional bug and some decidedly un-PC humor, Reprobed offers up a good time.

The shoot 'em up genre taken to the limits and we love it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tesla Force is one of the few rogue-lite games I have ever played, and I also rarely play twin stick shooters. I found the experience a little chaffing at times, in how I had to restart a chapter of random stages after dying, but there is a lot of satisfaction derived from unlocking better and better weapons, abilities, and perks and laying waste to the monsters. Best played with a friend or three, Tesla Force is pretty cool and reasonably priced for the experience it offers overall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’re a fan of twin-stick shooters, Tesla Force is up there with the best of them. It wastes no time in throwing an overwhelming number of monsters at you, and to succeed you need to become a master of shooting, dodging, and collecting those mech parts. It’s simple, but it’s fun – and gunning down a full horde of nasties with a machine gun is oh so very satisfying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As a roguelike follow-up to a pretty fun twin-stick shooter from a couple years back, Tesla Force incorporates plenty of interesting mechanics and systems that help make its frantic shooting action feel fresh and exciting.",,,,,,,,"Tesla Force is a bizarre amalgamation of ideas that never seem to really make much sense together. While science relies on experimentation, Tesla Force could really have used more time in the lab.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"10tons has taken their titles to another level with Tesla vs Lovecraft by replicating the twin-stick shooter of their previous Tesla outing, and incorporating the roguelike elements has made this the ultimate Tesla & Lovecraftian crossover thus far.

The 'Doomsday Clock' keeps the AI a tricky beast to tame, as they slowly begin to climb in difficulty throughout the run, culminating in the end boss fight that differs in difficulty based on how quickly or slowly it took to get there. The visual display that is on show when the enemies become quite sporadic and overwhelming, only to then get destroyed by Tesla in a mech suit is one of the more exciting and riveting experiences that makes this adventure worth going back to.",,,,,,,,"Tesla Force is a twin-stick shooter with fast action and procedural generated levels that after a little while look the same.

In any case, this eclectic mix of genres works, and whether played alone or in co-op it’s largely a beat-filled blast.",,"Soundfall isn’t a perfect game. I’d love to see the narrative throw more challenges my way and the somewhat repetitive levels would benefit from a few added platformer elements for variety's sake. That being said, I haven’t had this much stake-free fun playing a game in a long time. Amidst the heavy gaming themes I’m used to, I loved shimmying my way through Soundfall’s varying levels as it took me on a musical tour for the senses. Soundfall has the groundwork to be a timeless hit, it just needed a little more tweaking in the studio.",,,,,,,,"Soundfall is a game that makes an excellent first impression, but it ends up becoming boring throughout its numerous stages.

The music never fails to suck you in to each leve,l and the story and characters are cute. However it’s not all solos and encores, as the level design is rather bland and repetitive and the multiplayer leaves a lot to be desired. If you are in the mood for a dungeon crawler with a nice twist, you have a gem in Soundfall. Just don’t go expecting an overly deep loot system or anything too complex. It’s a rather straight forward game that’s all about getting lost in the sounds, which honestly can be rather nice to do.",,,,,,,"It’s no chart-topper, but the funky flows of Soundfall resonate.

warhammer-chaosbane,,,,,,,,"As an unashamed Diablo clone, Warhammer: Chaosbane Slayer Edition fares better than most. The game performs very well on PS5, enjoying the benefits of a high frame rate and resolution while keeping the hordes of Chaos minions coming, however the core of monotonous gameplay and lack of mission variation keeps this from being considered a classic experience.

session-skate-sim,,,,,"Despite how ugly I might find it, there’s no doubt that the gameplay in Session is its strongest suit. The difficulty might not be for everyone, but I urge anyone interested to stick with it and try to embrace what it offers — a sim-like, realistic skating experience. I commend the devs for trying something new and interesting within the genre, and while not as immediately approachable as most games, it’s something that any skating fan should try.",,,"Session's ultra-realistic skating mechanics are spot-on and reward your practice and patience. However, it's set in a world that feels a little dead, empty and cold at times and the structure the game does give you isn't particularly interesting or user-friendly.",,,,,"Session: Skate Sim is unique amongst its peers. Its control scheme, while taking time to master, is massively rewarding. Rolling around the streets and finding your own skating lines is addictively entertaining. It's a shame about the quest system, its overall presentation and some of the rough edges but do I feel Session is a few patches away from greatness.",,,,,,,,,,"Session: Skate Sim is a skate simulation that was very clearly designed with skaters in mind. From the extremely involved control scheme to the perfectly captured recreation of skate culture, the game seems like it was never intended to be a gateway for non-skaters to get into the sport. But the bugs, difficulty, general lack of fun, and incomplete state of the game make it difficult to recommend Session to its target audience as well. Some gamers may be able to break through the learning curve and appreciate the thoroughness put into creating such an involved skate sim, but at the end of the day, it's simply not fun.",,"Session is the skating game I've always dreamed someone would make, where performing even a 'simple' trick is significant and challenging. There are no mile-long grinds or 900-degree kickflips here: just real skating in its rawest form. It doesn't just simulate the sport, but the art of skating too. You need to get creative, looking at the everyday clutter of a city and dreaming up ways to make something rad out of it. That's what street skating is all about, and why Session is the best virtual expression of the artform yet.",,,"With the presence of multiple pro skaters including Daewon Song and Samarria Brevard, as well as a semi-open world with legendary skate spots like Black Hubbus and FDR Park, Sessions: Skate Sim is a well-written love letter to the sport.

Hardcore players will enjoy it, others not so much. Session: Skate Sim is just an unfinished version of a project with good ideas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Although Session: Skate Sim is a difficult game to get used to, the joy of pulling off tricks far outweighs the frustration. It faithfully recreates skateboarding culture of the 90s, and offers tons of freedom to play however you want.",,,,"Sim games approach their subjects with a mix of reverence and intense focus. Unlike more arcade-style skateboarding games, Session is a pure, unfiltered experience. If you want to recreate the slow, careful process of learning how to skate, this is your game. But be warned!

The missions have a habit of being poorly explained, furthered by being unable to re-read text boxes explaining what you need to do. And rarely do the inputs needed for specific moves get shown during these prompts. For better or worse, Session is a game for the hardcore skater. While its dedication to realism is impressive, the frustration in the early hours is likely to turn most off.",,,"Session: Skate Sim knows how to capture what makes skating so much fun with its in-depth settings and excellent board control and physics like no other game.

Add onto that a healthy serving of jank and bugs, and Session: Skate Sim becomes a hard sell. However, if you can look past its flaws and are down for a challenge, it’s worth giving a shot as the innovations it does present are worth experiencing, and the highs you will receive from mastering the complex controls are unlike anything else the genre has to offer.",,,,,,,,"It’d be nice if the game did more in the way of teaching you the ropes, offered different control schemes, and provided a wider array of accessibility options.

The additions that have been made here make it even more complete and also worth a replay for the Neptunia faithful. And if nothing else having an excuse to watch Neptune and the other girls run around in swimwear costumes for a few hours is always worth the investment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Neptunia ReVerse has enjoyable combat and engaging RPG systems, but it's not worth enduring the ""fan service"" to experience them.",,,,,,,,,,,,"For newcomers to the series, Neptunia ReVerse isn't a bad starting point. The story is breezy and the overall gameplay is good, even if you have to deal with uneven difficulty. For veterans, the new fishing minigame is cute, but Arrange mode throws off the balance and isn't much of an incentive to return to the game. Overall, it isn't a bad PS5-exclusive RPG, but you might want to wait for the team to develop something new for the platform.",,,,,,"Neptunia ReVerse is a wonderful iteration of a lovely RPG classic that both fans and newcomers can enjoy.

The fishing minigame is the only real use of the DualSense’s triggers, and while the game’s loading times have been basically erased, that is likely due to the PS5’s SSD speed and little else. It helps when the game’s assets aren’t all that graphically intense to begin with, after all. Neptunia ReVerse plays it safe with a standard JRPG setup for this long-running series, and while it’s something fans of the series will have some fun with, it’s not necessarily a standout title. Neptune has seen better treatment, but she has also seen worse. Thus, fans could hardly go wrong in picking this re-remake up in the near future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Neptunia ReVerse is a title that sticks too closely to its roots to be a standout, next-gen experience. Despite the presence of a moderately entertaining gameplay loop, decent mechanics, and delightful character banter, the embarrassingly feeble graphical quality, lack of innovation for the series, and disturbingly overt reliance on old systems from a Vita remake from over half a decade ago brings this experience down more than a few notches.",,,,,,"If you love the fanservice and the typical demented humor that distinguishes Japanese productions, Neptunia ReVerse will be the perfect starting point to discover (or rediscover) a franchise that has now become a cult among fans of Japanese role-playing games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite its strengths, Neptunia ReVerse should have been so much more. The best parts of the original continue to hold up, with a hilarious script and engaging combat. Yet, this is a remake to a fault. The game looks basic for a PS5 game while the narrative ignores the larger cast. The new features like fishing are welcomed, but aren't implemented well enough. By adding very little and doing nothing to take advantage of the new hardware, Neptune's latest ultimately feels like a missed opportunity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Compile Heart, and the Neptunia series in particular, have the kind of negative reputation that begs you to push through and find the treasure that keeps these games releasing a full decade later. Sadly, if there is a diamond in all this rough, it’s not to be found in Neptunia ReVerse. The repetitiveness of the core experience is unlikely to win over non-fans, and longtime fans will feel disappointed, if not insulted, by the lack of changes from Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1, and PlayStation 5 exclusivity proves the final nail in the coffin for this remaster in search of an audience.",,,,,,,,,,"While Neptunia ReVerse is a great package for newcomers to get into Neptunia games, veterans should wait for a sale before jumping into Compile Heart's first PS5 release.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A pity it doesn't take more risks and is so predictable in almost everything it does.",,,,,,,"Aliens: Fireteam Elite has an interesting premise: co-op shooter set in the Alien universe where players must push their abilities, refine their build, and face a continuous onslaught of enemies.

Aliens is an action movie at heart, and it’s evident that Cold Iron Studios made a strong effort to capture that ‘80s action movie feel. While the campaign is lackluster and mission variety is sparse, it’s hard to deny that tearing through hordes of Xenomorphs with your friends isn’t fun. While I don’t know if the game has a long-term impact in the way of future content that Cold Iron Studios is going to be putting out in Seasons, there’s enough content here to enjoy for a weekend or two with friends.

It can offer lots of fun and tons of shooting, which should be enough for at least a couple of evenings.",,,,"Aliens: Fireteam Elite is a hugely entertaining co-op shooter, only brought down by the formulaic structure of its missions and the odd rough edge. Developer Cold Iron Studios is promising more free content in the future, however, and has the chance to turn the game into something rather special. With more horde maps, marine classes and perhaps a mission tweak here and there, we could imagine returning to Aliens: Fireteam Elite time and time again, long into the future. Right now though, while some team-based third-person shooter fans will have plenty of fun with it, it’s only really a must for Alien fans.",,,,,,"A nice cooperative shooter with a great atmosphere and plenty of customization possibilities.Its only flaw is that its mechanics end up being quite repetitive, but if you get together with two friends you will have a great time killing aliens.",,"Aliens: Fireteam Elite is a proposal that, in general terms, we have loved for its fidelity to the Alien movies and because it does not seek to be anything more than an action experience a la Left 4 Dead, already with built-in improvements that can be seen in Back 4 Blood, to kill aliens without stopping. However, it could have been much more and bring some variety to not always be the same. Still, if you are fans of the movie saga you can't let it escape.",,,,,,,"Aliens: Fireteam Elite is tricky to judge. The gameplay loop is repetitive and retreads a lot of the tropes found in similar co-op shooter experiences. Its presentation is good but inconsistent. What it does well is capturing the visuals and sound of the movies and distilling them into a well-established formula. There's a good variety of combat classes and engaging ways to customize and improve builds, so players are incentivized to continue playing and get better as the difficulty ratchets up to add a thrilling survival component. I am concerned about the title's online matchmaking, which we were unable to test. Since the title does not support crossplay, the game's longevity and player base will depend on early adopters and future content releases to prove that this online shooter is here to stay.",,,,"For 35 years, Aliens fans have experienced letdown after letdown with video game adaptations.

Stuffed with guns, gadgets, and plentiful alien goo, it's a frenetic cooperative firefight against some of sci-fi's most iconic monsters in an all-new tale that takes us beyond the original trilogy. No, it's not the most sophisticated shooter, and no, its truncated runtime is unlikely to occupy you for more than a couple of nights, but it's an unashamedly good romp that'll hopefully satisfy your Ripley power fantasies, too.",,,,,"There have been a slew of movie franchises that have gone with cooperative multiplayer experience in recent years. Aliens: Fireteam Elite goes deeper and offers a lot for those that like grinding. The game just lacks a hook to keep players engaged as missions are long and redundant. The weapon unlocks and adding perks helps to keep things going, but the means of the game is separately leveling up each of the five classes across twelve long missions. Hardcore Aliens fans that liked the action-focused movies that differ from the original may find this right up their alley. The audio aspect could be amazing if there was a way to mute the comms narrative that ruins the atmosphere of the game. Ultimately, Aliens: Fireteam Elite is a functional cooperative third-person shooter that’s an improvement to Colonial Marines, but doesn’t supersede Isolation.","Aliens: Fireteam Elite (finally) proves that a great game based on the Alien films is possible in the modern era.

When you’re in the moment, obliterating hundreds of enemies using iconic weapons, against the backdrop of stunning locations that tap into the amazing cinematography the Alien franchise is known for, any shortcomings almost seem irrelevant. And, with the promise of free playable content to come across the next year, the rock-solid foundation which Cold Iron Studios has built could turn into something truly special.",,,,,,,,,,"Despite what its reduced price might suggest, there's a lot here to keep you entertained for numerous hours, especially once you've managed your first run through all four acts and start tackling them again with higher difficulty settings in the pursuit of consistently better gear.

Can't wait to see what comes next!",Oddworld: Soulstorm is a great game with some great problems.,"Oddworld: Soulstorm is an adventure platform of yesteryear, which manages to modernize its playful formula only at times, with the addition of some guessed tricks aimed at perfecting the framework of Abe's Exoddus. Not everything flows with the right fluidity, and the consistent difficulty of the game is aggravated by unfortunate game design choices: yet, when it works, the work of Oddworld Inhabitants manages to guarantee a good dose of satisfaction, thanks to a substantial amount of content and of Abe's immortal grotesque charm.","Even with some technical issues and a lack of originality, Oddworld: Soulstorm is still one of the ideal games of what Abe's adventures should be. Good.",,,,,,,"If the original games were part of your childhood, then Oddworld: Soulstorm deserves your visit, especially if you have a PlayStation 5, as it is one of the PS Plus offers. The journey is long and hard, loaded with moments of frustration caused by forces that exceed our expertise. But if you are willing to overcome these countless barriers you will find a title filled with good puzzles and excellent cutscenes, led by a strangely relatable protagonist.",,,"Oddworld: Soulstorm is a fantastic modernized remake of one of those side-scrollers that we remember as great but the original doesn’t hold up. Although it can be an aggravating slog to get through its escort quest-heavy levels, it’s also a unique, delightfully bizarre, and utterly rewarding experience with a fantastic story and a lot of heart. Of course, it also has far too many bugs that force restarts to circumvent, and that can turn the frustration of a good challenge into the bad, controller-throwing kind, and the sound design is all over the place.",,,,,,,,,,"This is a wild ride with ups and downs, cheering and cursing. Fascination and disenchantment are constantly fighting for dominance, so in the end this is merely a mediocre experience.",,,,,"A great narrative Oddworld game, but with too many technical problems and a I.A. that sometimes will destroy your nerves.",,"Soulstorm retains the series' signature charm, but it's not enough to forgive its tedious and dated design as well its litany of swear-inducing technical issues.",,,,"Oddworld: Soulstorm is an imperfect game, like many other, but unlike most of them it accepts the idea of taking risks to achieve something different. Unfortunately, it only sometimes happens, but it was worth trying. As Abe knows well, there’s no way other than fighting (or jumping, or chanting…) to achieve what you want.",,,,,,,,"The setting of the game is beautiful and makes us want to contemplate the universe of Oddworld. The cinematics are also outstanding and the game is very generous in terms of content. The gameplay first seems more modern and nervous, yet the overall experience is as frustrating as frustration can get. The crafting elements combined with the 1st-time only activated check point force us to loot lockers and dumpsters as we die (so again and again and again). The game has a lot of bugs and the repetitiveness of some segments of the game can make the overall experience dull instead of fun.",,,"Oddworld: Soulstorm is an excellent adventure game and platformer, with cool mechanics that keep gameplay fresh. The environments are stunning, and the 2.9D animation makes the world feel three-dimensional and lived-in. Only held back by a slew of bugs, Oddworld: Soulstorm is a great installment in a classic franchise.",,,,,,"This flashy remake of Abe's sequel is gorgeous to look at, but it rarely captures the excitement or feeling of the Oddworld forebears.","Oddworld: Soulstorm refines a lot from the previous games, but it comes at the cost of adding in new mechanics that never really click. The core element has improved, and it’s easy to see the franchise continuing to improve going forward, without needless additions. Soulstorm just falls that little short of great this time around, sadly.",,,,,,,,,"Even with its issues, Oddworld: Soulstorm is, without a doubt, one of the best games released this year. Despite some weirdness in the checkpoint system, a few bugs, and a difficulty level that may be too high for some, there is no denying that the long wait has been well worth it, as the game is clearly a product of love that all fans of the series and of 2D platform games in general will like.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I can’t say that what I played is a bad game, but saying that the audience for this isn’t somewhat narrow in scope would be doing it a disservice. Then again, Inhabitants just wanted to make something that’s serviceable, and I feel safe in saying that it succeeded on that front. It’s not very often you find yourself doing stealth in a 2.5D game these days, but it’s here and it’s doing its thing with reckless abandon. If you don’t mind the slow burn pace of the gameplay, you’re going to find yourself helping Abe stick it to the man to be an enjoyable experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isonzo,,,,,,,,"Isonzo injects some much needed verticality and colour into attritional World War I conflict. The class types allow players plenty of ways to contribute, although online competition can feel like a meat grinder. A way to gradually introduce new faces would've been very welcome, although there isn't that much to Isonzo as a package. For offline combatants, the bots do provide a more forgiving opposition, if a touch predictable. Online with strangers, I struggled to find organisation amongst players. Still, there are moments where it shines with a mix of tension and victory. More maps are forthcoming and it is cheap which could entice someone to give it a shot.",,,,,"Shifting the action from both the muddy trenches of the Western Front and the snow-dappled rural expanses of the Eastern Front to the blood-soaked peaks of The Great War's arguably most sophisticated theatre of conflict, developers BlackMill Games and M2H have excelled themselves with Isonzo. A thoroughly thoughtful and visceral first-person shooter where tactics and strategy are valued equally to a quick trigger finger, Isonzo isn't just the best entry in the WW1 Game Series to date, it also happens to be one of the best tactical multiplayer shooters full stop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Isonzo is an honorable attempt at creating the historical events of the battles between the Italian and Austro-Hungarian armies. The multiplayer-only component with concern for long-term player base sustainability, alongside a multitude of user experience gripes make it an unremarkable experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Isonzo is already the third World War 1 shooter from the Dutch Blackmill Games studios. It's pretty clear that Isonzo refines the renowned formula.,,,,,,,,,,,"The third installment in the WW1 series does not disappoint with recognizable gameplay in a new format, considering the battlefield has moved to Italy. It looks graphically neat, the authenticity is evident and the gameplay can be very hectic. At the same time, though, you have to expect a relatively steep learning curve and somewhat clunky controls on consoles. Nevertheless, Isonzo is a shooter worth mentioning.",,"Isonzo is a decent game. Solid in many areas, but never one to show off, the title delivers a good gameplay core, and offers it up at a reasonable price. Performance problems aside, good gunplay and interesting maps are enough to make the experience worth it, at least in the short term. A campaign or a large pool of maps could certainly enhance the value of the title, but even without it, you have a lean, satisfying experience that will be especially appealing to anyone with an interest in the First World War.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"World War I returns with the Italian theatre authentically recreated for some grounded, methodical FPS action. The real war was a grind and Isonzo maybe captures that feeling a little too well with a lack of variety in maps and modes, coupled with some major technical and visual issues. Even so, it’s an earnest effort that’ll draw in appreciators of history and those who like their FPS experiences to be more tactical and threatening than the Battlefield 2042s of the world.",,,,,"Isonzo may be fascinating for people who enjoy historical settings in an FPS. Unfortunately, gameplay wise is far from perfect and it needs way more content to captivate its players.",,,,,"The realism of the battlefields, uniforms and guns is at the heart and core of the game. The combat is brutal and unrelenting for anyone looking to dive into the historical battlefields of Isonzo. Players will have to deal with constant deaths while engaging with this historically accurate, tactical FPS delivered by BlackMill Games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Isonzo is the third act of the WW1 Game Series franchise developed by Blackmill Games which, even without proposing major changes compared to Verdun and Tannenberg, proved to be a good tactical shooter that evokes the battles on the Italian front.

The ambient weight of the setting provides essential context. We’re watching the antagonists as they struggle with impending defeat. Every glimpse of the flagship Gundam across enemy lines spins up genuine dread. Yet even this power is used too sparingly. The Gundam franchise is a massive, sweeping saga whose greatest battles are also remarkably intimate. Colossal wars are distilled into two machines engaging in physical and ideological struggles. So far, this is markedly absent from Code Fairy. Hopefully, the next two volumes find more solid narrative footing.",,,,,,,,"It's difficult to recommend Gundam Battle Operation: Code Fairy - Vol. 1 on its own merits. It's effectively one-third of a storyline that is a tutorial and stand-alone story for GBO2's gameplay without its ""gotcha"" elements, but at this moment, the game is effectively incomplete. Vol. 2 and Vol. 3 will be released within the next month. When it has the full storyline and set of units, it'll be a lot easier to make a determination about the entire package, but until that happens, you're better off waiting unless you're a huge Gundam fan who has to play this right away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation: Code Fairy is strictly for the fans. That isn’t to say people who are unfamiliar with the series won’t enjoy it. Indeed, with as few walking tank games out there as it is, anyone into this type of gameplay will probably enjoy things here. It’s just that being invested in the story of Gundam helps a lot, because much of the game is about taking in the story. Combat is clunky, but gets the job done, and the episodic format makes that fact easier to forgive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation Code Fairy is a unique game. It’s unlike any I’ve played from the Gundam series as it’s carried by its story and characters who I grew attached to over the chapters. The quality animations and voice work do wonders for the enjoyment factor, and the missions provide just enough interaction to get the player involved in the action. Sure, it can feel a bit oversimplified, but if the idea is to make me want to play Battle Operation 2, then I just might be more interested now than I’ve ever been.",,,,,"Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operation Code Fairy tells an original, different and interesting story set during the One Year War.

I was finally able to get a handle on the combat and movement system that Battle Operation uses. But really the true cherry here was the fantastic story of the Noisy Fairy Squadron, watching this team start off on shaky ground but ultimately coming together and meshing as all good teams do was just the feel-good story that I needed to see. Its one that really resonates with people, and the fact that it's so well done and is an all-female team is a nice chef’s kiss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though Milestone's practiced hand at crafting reliably enjoyable design frameworks and handling models from previous games make it to Sony's latest console intact, there's simply not enough done on the feature set and visual presentation side of things to make Monster Energy Supercross 4 feel like a true leap forward from its last-gen predecessors. Nonetheless, though longtime fans of the series will surely lap this up, newcomers should expect to be freshly punished by the game's unforgiving, though ultimately satisfying handling system.",,,,,,,,,,,"Monster Energy Supercross – The Official Videogame 4 isn’t a bad game at all, rather it’s just an incredibly difficult one that leaves no room for novices to enter the dirt track arena.

The multiple modes work well, the track creation is solid, and the customization in the game is on point.",,,,"Monster Energy Supercross 4 is not easy to get the hang of, and even seasoned players will find frustration in the game's very grindy career mode.

And it still could be with a patch or two. But right now, the issues with the difficulty, AI and physics are notable setbacks. Series veterans who can give Realistic AI a run for their money will find plenty to be happy about, but those who aren’t so capable are likely to find themselves frustrated time and time again. It’s not so much that Monster Energy Supercross 4 is hard, it’s that sometimes it feels like it’s unfair – that the AI doesn’t play by the same rules as you. And that doesn’t lead to a fun racing experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This game is a battle against yourself. A race against your own patience, response time and decision making in every second, in every race. It's something very technical. Is it the attachment to realism that makes Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 4 a title that scares off the most novice or less patient of players? Probably. But Milestone bets on those who indulge in this level of technical simulation that, although far from perfect, does invite you to lose yourself in it.",,,,"It's a small step further for the official Supercross game, but a step nonetheless.",,,,,,Supercross 4 is another solid entry in the popular racing genre. Its lackluster career and the fairly steep learning curve however is stopping the racing game from accelerating further.,,,,,,,,,,,,"Milestone delivers on its slate of upgrades introduced in Monster Energy Supercross 4, but the racing remains frustrating and unapproachable for new players. The Career Mode is a welcome addition even though it may not match up to other franchises that are out there, while The Compound gives players a new location to free roam around in, but is ultimately the same thing outside of the location. The PlayStation 5 version allows for better visuals and the inclusion of the DualSense Controller, but the engine that everything is based on is old. Those that are hardcore fans of the series will enjoy these additions if they continue to overlook the legacy issues. The next-generation version is basically an improved version of the previous-gen version by default due to the hardware, and outside of the Career Mode, Monster Energy Supercross 4 is more of the same.",,,,,,,,,,,Supercross 4 is a complex game to approach that doesn't do much to be appealing to the general public.,,,,,,,,,,,"Monster Energy Supercross 4 is another typically robust take on the AMA Supercross Championship but, with fewer concessions for newcomers and casual players and the changes to career mode ultimately being a little rudimentary, this particular instalment feels as if it’s both steering away from courting new fans and not quite doing enough to compel existing players to upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 4 could have been a racing game with some brilliant ideas and a quite fresh career concept, but the overall result is quite opaque.

It might lack significant new features, but it’s damn entertaining and its qualities are undeniable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With such assured motion, incident-packed races and gorgeous stadium track visuals this should be an easy recommendation, especially since it’s a deluxe version of an already-polished series.

I’ve never had a Monster Energy drink and I haven’t played a motocross game in over 15 years, but the game is a blast. The tutorial sucks and leaves out (or brushes over) absolutely crucial information, but the bike physics and racing action make a difficult to master game so exciting to play.

redout-2,,,,,,,,"Redout 2 delivers where it matters with some of the fastest, most hardcore racing we've seen in a game. The bold visuals add to sense of excitement too. It's just a shame that the difficulty isn't more consistent and that the game is lacking in variation, especially as some of the gameplay modes aren't ready yet and will be patched in later when much of the game's already small community may have drifted elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Redout 2 is specifically designed for people who need to master every track – anyone who stops short of that probably won’t enjoy it too much. It’s meant for people who want racers to challenge them, so if that’s what you’re after, this is a game you need to play.",Players experienced in this genre and fans of F-Zero will likely love Redout 2. It's appropriately challenging and adrenaline pumping. When players struggle with control there's little fun to be had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While the core gameplay of Redout 2 is solid, the difficulty spikes will suck much of the fun out of the experience for some. And while steadily developing your ship helps players adjust to the increase in speed over the course of the career, it’s a strange and unfortunate choice to not offer a range of starting craft, tuned to multiple play styles. With a bit of work, then, Redout 2 could really stand out in the anti-gravity racer genre. But until then, it’s hard to recommend to all but the brave and the hardcore.","Redout 2 is a game that looks amazingly sleek and fun through pictures, descriptions, and videos. The facade is dropped when you actually play the game for yourself, and find a slew of poor design choices, unnecessary difficulty curves, incomplete features, and repetitive gameplay. This doesn’t even include the atrociously implemented HDR that burned my eyes and gave me a headache. Even if you’re a fan of the genre, I recommend sticking with the first Redout until this sequel is heavily patched or discounted.",,,,,,,,,"Overall, the Redout 2 experience was mind-blowing due to its speed and excellent mechanics. But it was also frustrating because of some paths, some events in campaign mode, and the inconsistent AI. It is certainly one of the best and most complete packages in the genre today and a highly recommended title for racing fans and those who like a good challenge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Redout 2 won't be worth the effort for a lot of people. It is rewarding, sure, but to be brutally honest, part of us thinks that you should just boot up WipEout Omega Collection instead and save yourself the trouble.",,,,A successful tribute to F-Zero and WipEout where going fast never stops being fun. Its surprisingly meaty career mode more than justifies the price tag but it may struggle to win over more casual racing enthusiasts.,,,,,,,,,,,"If you liked Redout, you’ll adore Redout 2. It’s magnificent, but ruthlessly hardcore. [Issue#17, p.74]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Thanks to its focus on speed and a relatively high-skill ceiling, Redout 2 might end up being too niche for some. This also means that it’s a rather one-of-a-kind game these days, and if going down insane tracks at high speeds in futuristic rocket ships sounds fun, Redout 2 can be a great time.",,,,,,,"Redout 2 has no time for the casual player and, sadly, that means it's often an infuriating and frustratingly un-fun experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blasting through unbelievable tracks at sonic speeds, Redout 2 is one of the fastest racing games around. It shows off beautiful science-fiction races across an alternate Earth and galaxy. Yet, the track design is impractical, making it a challenge to play and that difficulty extends into the beastly AI, tiresome overheating mechanic, and time trials demanding precision and perfection. Multiplayer doesn’t hold up either, with network and matchmaking problems galore and a handful of bugs breaking races and visuals. However, there is still a fantastic amount of single-player content for the adrenaline junkie looking for extreme fun.",,,,Mastering curves and gravity in Redout 2 is quite a challenge on its futuristic tracks. The game has a fairly decent level of customization and hundreds of challenges. It can be played online but it does not have local multiplayer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
monark,,,,,,,"Monark brings to the table a lot of fresh ideas, but the bad game design prevents the game from reaching its full potential, leaving you with nothing more than a mediocre experience.",Monark has some good ideas and systems in place but the low budget presentation and enforced grinding stop this from being more than an interesting experience.,,,,,"Monark has many great ideas, and some of them are executed well, but the game falters when it requires you to grind for hours just to stand a chance against the next story battle. The exploration and puzzle-solving keep things exciting, and the use of the Seven Deadly Sins for character personalities is a unique way to develop your characters. All in all, though, Monark may have been a better adventure or visual novel game than an RPG.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There is enough here that I’d give a Monark follow-up a shot. One that fills out its stories a bit more, amps up the horror, and flattens out the grind. There are some novel ideas here, and if you’re looking for something outside the RPG status quo and with a darker vibe, Monark could fit the bill. Just go in knowing that it can get arduous, and you’ll need to overlook those faults to find what Monark does that’s really different.",,"Monark can be seen as a good opportunity to try something new in an ocean of stale JRPG tropes, especially for the players who enjoy tactical thinking and resource management gameplay.",,,,,,,,,,"Monark is a slow and frustrating RPG for several hours. Its Ego system is its most interesting point, along with its puzzles, although everything is diluted with uninteresting characters and a gameplay that becomes stagnant. It feels like ""more of the same"", but after a while it becomes enjoyable to play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The story and the philosophical themes give Monark a reason to play and that also counts for the tactical combat. However, visually the game is not that good and the level design could also be a lot better. Monark introduces a lot of original ideas and styles, but fails in the execution which is a shame. Don’t get it wrong, it’s a fine game, but it has so much more potential.",,"There's an interesting story here and the horror-JRPG vibe is much appreciated, but whatever enjoyment they could bring you is utterly annihilated by the outrageous, egregious amount of grinding you'll need to do to see the game through. Monark is gaming reduced to a thick, treacly sludge to wade through, no cutscene or story beat or reward ever feeling like it was worth the struggle. Just play Shin Megami Tensei while listening to Nine Inch Nails and you'll have a better time.",,,,,"Rich and demanding, the clashes are gripping, worthy of frenzied chess games during which each placement must be thought out and calculated. On the other hand, the title is served by its technical shortcomings, a lack of depth in its dialogues, as well as a difficult attachment to the characters. Despite everything, Monark knows how to establish itself as an experience to live for any J-RPG lover looking for strategic brawls that oppose him with some resistance.",,,,,,,,,,"Despite uneven patches in overall presentation, combat is superb. Easily understandable yet laden with depth, gripping enemy encounters elevate Monark. [Issue#12, p.89]","A new scholar JRPG adventure game in the same vein as Shin Megami Tensei, but not as good. Pretty lengthy, deep and engaging, but somewhat unoriginal and technically dated.",,,,,,,"Monark weaves an engaging story even though it may rely on tropes and archetypes to do so. While characters and certain themes may feel familiar from playing similar games there ego centric method of character development helps carve a unique identity for Monark. The puzzles and exploration aren’t very difficult but occur in a way that feels organic within the story. The tactical turn based battles do offer a challenge but nothing that can’t be overcome through learning the system and properly strategizing. Level grinding can become tedious quickly and can disrupt the overall pacing. In spite this, Monark is a very enjoyable RPG that offers satisfying combat along with a compelling story.",,"It does its job as a JRPG, thanks to its universe and battle system, but some limitations and repetitiveness prevent it from making the most of its virtues.",,,"Monark puts a spin on the high school JRPG design by offering unique gameplay and combat systems for fans of the genre. The narrative heightens this experience with a memorable cast and plenty of mysteries to uncover. The spike in difficulty hurts the experience as the balance of vague puzzles and encounters slows the pacing down to a crawl, but genre veterans might enjoy the art of grinding and not notice this too much.",,,"Monark has a lot of good ideas, but almost all of them are let down by a repetitive structure, grindy combat, and baffling design decisions.",,"A solid JRPG with good arts and bad graphics, Monark has some edge in terms of combat system and its great cast: a game that hardcore JRPG fans will surely enjoy a lot.","Seven years after the launch of Lost Dimension, FuRyu and the Lancarse studio are back on the scene to impress JRPG fans with dark-hued tactics. Although the influence of Shin Megami Tensei and Persona 5 in particular is evident on the narrative level, MONARK has won us over with a dramatic, crazy and sometimes brutal story, as well as able to make us reflect on the most hidden and primitive desires of mankind. So put aside any skepticism related to the almost unknown name of the Japanese developer and let yourself be overwhelmed by MONARK's excellent turn-based combat system: you'll go crazy!","We had high expectations for Monark, as some of the people who worked on it have given birth to some of the old Persona games, but we've come highly disappointed, due to absurd design choices and PS2 era graphics.",,,,,,,,,,Monark has some good ideas on how to reinvigorate tactical JPRG combat but its repetitive level design makes it feel more like a prototype.,,,,"It may not be the next great JRPG, but if you’ve been looking for a tactics style game that provides a decent challenge, I’m going to recommend picking Monark up when your budget allows. It fits right into the niche, and the story’s twists and turns might just surprise you. If you look past the bland character models and focus on their individual stories, there’s something charming and alluring lurking below the drab surface.",,,"Monark is a nice debut effort from Lancarse but I wish they’d spent more time balancing it. It’s got interesting ideas and a great combat system but is bogged down by repetitive level design, narrative cliches, and grindy gameplay. If you’re seeking a JRPG with a more horrifying aesthetic, you’ll have fun if you can look past those flaws. Shin Megami Tensei fans will probably enjoy what’s offered but otherwise, I can only truly recommend this to the JRPG faithful.","Monark has all of the dot points needed to be a great game, but it just doesn’t go far enough to stand out in any one area. It has a few great nuggets of ideas that would have been great to see expanded upon, but it barely scratches the surface. There are too many areas that were lacking either visual flare or gameplay substance for it to be memorable among titans like Persona and Megami Tensei. Despite that, it still might be worth playing for fans of the genre. It’s like popcorn — it’s not a masterpiece, but it’s easily consumable and will scratch that JRPG itch.",,,,,,,,"MONARK borrows more from the urban dark fantasy fictions of the 90's/2000's than from a Persona 5. Its rough approach, and especially its outdated realization will put off many of you. On the other hand, the most patient will discover a real good RPG, with a lot of passion inside, and whose interest grows with the time you give it.",,,,"Monark is a game filled with great ideas and themes, and it manages to deliver on some of those in spades. Unfortunately, Monark is also its own worst enemy, and many of the gameplay elements simply get in the way of making it something truly exceptional. Still, if you can manage to get through the slog of repetitiveness, there’s a fascinating and thematically engaging story underneath.","Monark is a turn based JRPG that brings to the table a lot of longevity and fun, especially for anime lovers, but unfortunately fails to reach its potential due to a technical department that is simply too dated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Monark isn’t a great game. I am not even sure I would call it a good one, but if it weren’t for the transphobia and atrocious pacing, I would likely be enthusiastically recommending it to the right sort of player. There is an earnest quality to its themes, characters and stories paired with an inventiveness to its combat. These qualities build a solid foundation a follow-up title could improve into something truly special. As is, if you have read my review, watched the trailers, played the demo, and still have interest in playing Monark, there is probably a good chance you would find some joy in playing it. For anyone else, you are likely best off waiting for the next Persona or a Monark 2.","Monark is an unrefined gem, but it is definitely a game worth checking out. While it certainly has some similar ideas as other properties, it pulls out enough tricks to make it different and individually inviting. Despite some issues, it’s a good first attempt with plenty of room for polish in any subsequent follow-up.",,"I wouldn’t be against seeing a Monark 2 one day, I’d love to get more of this combat, and if they can get the character models to look more like the drawings - even better. If we do get a sequel, I will definitely be approaching it with far less excitement than I went into this first Monark game with. Get yourself the free demo and when it’s over, ask yourself if you would have fun doing that same stuff over and over and over. If you think you would, then maybe you will have a better time with Monark than I did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
button-city,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Perhaps I have been rather critical of Button City; there is something sweet in its cuddly art style and although its dialogue and narrative may be try-hard, it is effective at times. The real issue is that it feels like its developers have relied too hard on simply being cute rather than focusing on creating engaging gameplay. Regardless of how adorable the protagonist and their friends may be, there’s just not enough here to hold my attention.",,,,,,,"Like a good diorama, Button City has a lot of fine detail. Sure the story is breezy and the characters are charming, but what about the games? What about the simple, engaging level design? I wish the sidequests were less about long walks, yes. I want a run button so very badly, it’s true. And the games could actually be harder. But I still want to visit this weird little town. I want to keep coming back to this arcade, I want to get sick of the only good games, I want to save up for the only good prizes. Whether you remember places like this or not, Button City is a delightful escape to the lost world of arcades. Heck, if you’ve got one in your town, this might convince you to start going again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Button City is one of those games that I really wanted to love but ended up displeased by its clunky setup and subpar mini-games. There is still a good time to be had in its cute world, though, especially if you don't mind taking the bad with the good.",,,,,,,,"Overall, it's a chilled out game with personality and charm, but there's not much more to it than that. While you may enjoy exploring the town and meeting its residents, there isn't enough substance here to keep things interesting.",,,,,,,,"Despite these bugs, Button City is a relaxing little game with a great storyline and characters you care about despite their faults. Players can work their way through the game at their own pace as they battle to save the arcade from greed, and Fennel from his own shy and unconfident self. The story isn’t lengthy, clocking in at 6-8 hours depending on how much time you spend playing arcade games and completing side missions, but it’s a nice little distraction for a rainy day.",,,,,,,"A good game for kids, sure, but adults will get even more out of it. Doesn’t quite meet 7 its potential, but this is a funny and clever little tale nonetheless. [Issue#5, p.91]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, Button City has more depth than I anticipated and the replayability is high if you fall in love with the mini games. Main story can be completed in under 6 hours, but there is more fun to be had after with the mini arcade games, and finishing side quests. The story is touching and has a really emotive meaning behind it. The characters are designed well, and are utterly charming and I can imagine some good merch coming out from their cute faces. The music is a bop, the art style is charismatic but there are a few hitches along the way. Movement speed can slow your game down a lot. There are a few technical bumps, but I would recommend for anyone who wants to free flow through an adventure narrative of Fennel and his Friends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Button City gets a lot right in its attempt to mesh late 90s low-poly style with narrative adventure gameplay and a heartfelt story full of great characters, but it's undone by numerous and often game-breaking bugs and a tad too much backtracking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There’s a definite appeal in its cozy atmosphere and oddball characters, and the story about a community banding together to save what’s important to them is a heartfelt one. The minigames are a lot of fun, and what they lack in the precision you’d expect of a full-fledged arcade game, they make up for in sheer charm. But it’s also a game that leans a little too heavily into the quirky style of the “wholesome game” meme at the expense of substance and depth.",,,,,,,,,,,Button City is a child-friendly adventure that pushes the right buttons with its combo of a sweet narrative and fun gameplay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
serious-sam-4-planet-badass,,,,,,,,Serious Sam 4 is exactly what you'd expect from a Serious Sam game but not what we've come to expect from a PS5 game. It's a simple but action-packed FPS that is full of enemies and carnage but it hasn't been ported across very well.,,,,,,,,,,Serious Sam 4's biggest sin is its lack of ambition. It is otherwise a decent and fun entry for its series of games.,,,,,,,,,"I'm not the world's biggest fan of shooters, but I have a soft spot for Serious Sam. It's partly because it exists to make fun of the rest of the genre, and do so in a colourful, easy-going way such that it's the equivalent of a Sunday morning cartoon. It's also all-action, but in the right way. I find more realistic shooters stressful when I'm being swamped from all sides, but Serious Sam does such a great job with the power fantasy that you'll look at a screen filled with 100 ugly beasties... and wish they had brought friends. I enjoyed getting re-acquainted with Serious Sam earlier in the year with the collection. With Serious Sam 4 I have a game that should have done better on the PlayStation 5 hardware, but is a new favourite shooter anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Stick Serious Sam 4 in performance mode, then, and while your experience won’t be perfect on PS5, you’ll still have a bloody good time. It’s perhaps the humour and simple premise of the game that will be more divisive; some will love it for its daft one-liners and balls-to-the-wall action, others may find it too repetitive and macho. If you like the idea of butchering an entire army of monsters ranging from vampires to reptilian demons that throw green balls of energy at you, however, then be sure to give it a go.",,,,,,,"Playing Serious Sam 4: Planet Badass can be fun. It’s also clear that the franchise is at a crossroads. It wants to steal from other AAA shooters, to have believable characters, NPCs, and a story. At the same time, it goes all-in with a lame-joke cracking juvenile in a man suit and gameplay that is rote, lacks creativity and is repetitive. Long load times and framerate issues don’t help, either. Twenty years on, Sam isn’t edgy, goofy or ironic. Sam’s schtick, and the gameplay that goes with him, are seriously due for a makeover.",,,,,,,,,,,,"A return to classic linear FPS gameplay is lost beneath a pile of broken mechanics, terrible dialogue, repetitive villain design, and some of the most boring environments I’ve ever seen. Serious Sam 4 is a remarkably dated game that should be reserved for the most “serious” of Serious Sam fans.",,,,,,,,,,"While fitfully fun and well designed, Sam 4 disappoints as both a sequel and a next-gen product. While it wasn’t particularly optimised on PC it still represents a low for PS5 performance. A compromised port of a game that’s only slightly above average in the first place. A serious shame.",,,,,,,,"Serious Sam 4 is good, mindless fun, that is unfortunately mired by performance issues. This is recommended for big fans of the series, or for those looking for a nostalgia fix, for back when games were simpler, linear affairs which could be completed in a weekend. It’s not a particularly great-looking or running game, but it is also only $39.99 at launch. The full campaign doesn’t overstay its welcome, and its many secrets will tempt completionists. Give it a shot if you like your bloody kills combined with quippy one-liners. Just be ready for a bumpy ride.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Serious Sam 4 on consoles is a beautifully fun mess. It’s more Serious Sam, which isn’t a bad thing, but there are performance problems that cannot be overlooked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For those who want a brutally raw retro-styled shooter where constant carnage is the order of the day, Serious Sam 4 will sate the bloodlust of even the most maniacal gamers. Not only that, but it’s genuinely funny and well-written, and the trials and tragedies Sam experiences tugged at my jaded heartstrings far more than I expected them to. Many would not enjoy Serious Sam 4 because gunning down endless waves of slavering aliens and mutants becomes brutally relentless – but if you’re a hardcore shooter purist, that’s exactly what you’re looking for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plus, the meta-humour and lovely cast of characters are more delightful than ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Confusing for newbies, Neptunia: Sisters VS Sisters hooks all genre fans. While it seems dated in many ways, it touches on red-hot topics surrounding influencers and AI, as well as media addiction. For this reason, a recommendation to play at least a little while.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Neptunia: Sisters VS Sisters has some fun ideas and absolutely beautiful visuals, but with an incredibly flawed combat system that fails to learn from its predecessors, we're ultimately left with another clunky spinoff that fails to move the needle for the franchise.

last-stop,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Variable State follows up the wordless weirdness of Virginia with a far more talkative, and more grounded, supernatural drama with Last Stop. The focus on its three protagonists’ everyday problems over the underlying odd phenomena helps to make each tale more engaging, and in turn, makes the stranger things that occur feel more captivatingly mysterious in their initially limited use. It’s a little light in terms of traditional player control, but Last Stop tells a hell of a good story that you still very much feel like you’re in the director’s chair for.",,,,,,,,,,,"Last Stop is endearing with its story and characters with a Hollywood caliber narrative design. It just wants to be a movie more than it wants to be a game, but it is entertaining, nonetheless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Last Stop’s anthology-based approach to storytelling is great and helps to keep you engaged throughout. Even though your choices don’t really impact the story, it’s a lovely journey that touches on some interesting themes. Unfortunately, the conclusion is disappointing as it delves a little too far into the realm of science fiction. Regardless of this, the grounded characters and interesting cast are worth meeting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Last Stop is all about the story, making its three storylines the centrepiece of the experience. Characters introduced by them quickly become staples as their personalities and unfortunate predicaments take hold, all the while the overall plot takes shape and builds to a crescendo. It's disappointing that the vast majority of your decisions have little to no impact, but the ride Last Stop takes you on is worthwhile regardless.",,,,,"Last Stop gave us an overall pleasant experience by concocting three distinct plots with fair flavors. Precise rhythm, convincing characters, story that keeps us in suspense: there is no doubt that the Variable State studio masters its pen. What a pity that the player's freedom is so compartmentalized by its lack of impact on events and that the technical quality tarnishes the experience. The adventure will however prove to be appreciable for fervent fans of narrative games who are just waiting to discover an entertaining story.","Last Stop is most enjoyable when it isn’t going anywhere. The end of each episode may hook you with a cliffhanger, but, when you look back on the game, the story fails to hang around. Instead, the scenes that stick in the memory don’t mean much at all.",,,,,,,,,"More of a playable movie than an adventure game, Last Stop boasts great characters and intriguing mysteries.

However, the chasm left by what is missing from the game at the moment is almost irredeemable. Whilst the actual fighting mechanics of the core gameplay are well worked for competitive play, the lack of voice acting, game modes and general party utility leaves much to be desired. The general zaniness of Nickelodeon carries reasonably in the game, but certainly not enough to warrant purchase by casual players who are fans of the franchise.",,,,,,,,"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is full of quirky references, easter eggs and cameos of many popular Nicktoons franchises. But once you manage to see past that, it's easy to notice what a shallow and empty game this is. Sure, it can be fun at times, but the magic dies down quite easily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ultimately, the success of Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl lies in how lively its online community is. We’ve found players easily enough so far, but who knows if they’ll stick around. It’ll be a shame if they don’t though, because this is a competent brawler. Its pleasant visuals, varied roster of beloved characters and surprisingly deep combat make it one of the better Smash-type games out there. But if there’s nobody online to play with, its offline content will quickly lose its fun.","Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl offers surprisingly competent Smash-like brawler gameplay, but is severely lacking in the bells-and-whistles department. Brawling fans will likely have a great time with this one, but those looking to ease into the genre should look elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There's a good skeleton to Nickelodeon All-Stars Brawl. The fighting is fast and extremely deep, despite having only one more attack button over the Super Smash Bros. series. For pro-type players who always play without items and can quickly master the game's nuances, this is excellent. However, the presentation is as basic as the game's modes, and the lack of anything that provides more of a Nickelodeon ""feel"" (e.g., voices and music) makes the whole thing feel rather cheap. While the online performance can be good, it doesn't matter much if there's no community behind it. The game is a contender, but some serious effort in more than a few areas needs to be done if Nickelodeon All-Stars Brawl or a potential sequel wants to be taken more seriously.",,,,,,"Although I was impressed by how solid its gameplay is, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl still feels like a hollow experience that could have been elevated to new heights if it featured additional modes and a more fleshed-out presentation complete with voice acting.",,,,,,,,"Again, it’s the best Smash clone we’ve ever played – we just wish Nickelodeon had shown some confidence in it.",,,,"A mechanically solid and fun Super Smash Bros. clone which doesn’t have the style, personality or affection for its characters to reach the heights of its inspiration.","Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is riddled with flaws. Not very pretty, not always very precise, a little sparse in content, the dubbing of the original cartoons are absent ... However, the fighting game of Fair Play Labs exudes passion. We don't recommend it to everyone, as NASB is targeting a very specific niche. By mimicking the physics of Super Smash Bros. Melee and implementing one of its advanced techniques, this atypical brawler manages to seduce those nostalgic for the early 2000s. Those will see it as a good way to immerse themselves in the licenses of their childhood while by rediscovering familiar sensations and a solid competitive environment. Hopefully the studio's follow-up will be good, as Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is holding something.",,,"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is a great Smash clone that painfully underutilizes its Nickelodeon license, to its own detriment. Lacking some of Nick’s biggest characters, franchises, and environments, absolutely no voice lines whatsoever, and all wrapped up in a rather unimpressive package, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is a good concept, and one of the best Smash-alikes to come along in the last 20 years. But it really needs a stronger presentation and more thorough use of its namesake license to earn a better foothold as a mainstay character brawler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl doesn’t bring anything new to the table, instead offering a certainly competent if not hugely exciting brawler with a confusing roster of characters cynically chopped up seemingly for future monetisation and very little to actually fight for in terms of unlockables for the fans. The fundamentals are here, and the Sports modes are terrific fun, but there isn’t much else to get too excited about when the content included is this lacking.",,"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is, well, fine. It will provide a good few hours of harmless fun and raise more than a few smiles in the nostalgia sector of the cortex as Reptar beats on April O'Neil. Underneath that initial sheen however is nothing of real interest. Thankfully, support seems to be very much active and maybe the initial issues will be focused on to provide a more well-rounded, in-depth experience. For now, though, the shadow of its inspiration looms heavy and ensures that this will not be challenging for any place in the top tier of party'esque fighters for some time.","A game clearly made by Smash aficionados, with great gameplay based on solid and layered mechanics.

Hopefully, Ludosity and Fair Play Labs can keep adding to Nick Brawl post-launch and flesh out what's missing while getting Nickelodeon’s full backing to make it a better product for the fans.",,,,,,,"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl feels incomplete in a lot of ways. It needed more modes, better sound design to provide some personality, a better selection of stages. If the developers take the time to fill the game out further, it could even end up being something pretty special. For now, this is still far better than a Nickelodeon fighting game has any right to be. The most important part of a fighting game is the feel, and the team at Ludosity nailed that. When I was tearing through foes with Reptar online, I had a hard time caring about what was missing. Players coming in with the right expectations will have a ton of fun, just don’t expect a game that is more than it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl may be basic on the surface, but the exhilarating gameplay and edge of your seat action more than makes up for its lack of content by providing players with a fun platform fighter that rewards those who take the time to learn its surprisingly complex combat mechanics.

Its narrative is lacking but the core characters are charming enough that by the end you can't help but almost feel attached to them all, as you've fought your way through to whichever ending you've chosen. If it weren't for the fact that you're constantly having to make everything work in spite of a camera and lock-on system that feels against you specifically, it would be a much easier game to recommend.",,,"Valkyrie Elysium shows its best side in combat, offering a frenetic, dynamic and demanding experience that does not have the right company in the other facets of the game.

There are aspects that need improvement, but this is still a great experience.",,,,,,"I found myself utterly captivated by this game, which takes so many creative risks in the name of its vision. The limited “story” in favour of a deeper narrative working on a more subtle level, downbeat and muted visuals, and graceful rather than visceral combat are all things that are lauded in video games, however appropriate to the experience that the developer is crafting. But this team stuck with the vision, and we should be thankful for that. If you do enjoy the likes of theatre, opera, and ballet, then Valkyrie Elysium belongs to the incredibly small group of titles that share a similarity to those art forms, and that’s more than a nice to have, it’s the kind of art we need to see more developers experimenting with.","Valkyrie Elysium is a lot of fun, and maybe that's good enough. It's a shame that a new Valkyrie Profile game isn't more than simply adequate, especially after all this time, but anyone looking for a quick and engaging action RPG will leave satisfied. It may not be a masterpiece, but Valkyrie Elysium is still entertaining and enjoyable.",,,,,,"Despite the cliche of the angry video game reviewer who “doesn’t even like video games,” it’s not that fun tearing down the work of people who haven’t done anything catastrophically wrong.

Still, if you’re an action game junkie like me, this is well worth your time and more.","Valkyrie Elysium is rather fun. Divorced from its heritage, it's a solid, if unexceptional, action-RPG.

But ultimately, they're minor annoyances compared to the main problem: Valkyrie Elysium is a mostly technically competent game weighed down by the dullness of its story, setting, and strategy. There are glimmers of fun in the combat and some of the dialogue--the rare mid-level Einherjar banter is always welcome--but it's not enough to overcome stifling mediocrity. Valkyrie Elysium is a mere pretender to the glory of this series' past endeavors.",,,"I was excited going into Valkyrie Elysium because of what I had heard about the series. While after my time with it that excitement certainly has dulled, not because of the combat but just because everything around it just kind of felt ‘meh’. If the world was more populated or at the very least more interesting there would be much more here to really sink one’s teeth into, as it stands once players are done doing Odin’s bidding they will find little reason to return in my opinion.",This 15-hour trip through humanity's end of days will leave you envying the dead.,,,Valkyrie Elysium delivers an average action experience that fails to revive a classic RPG series.,,,,,,,A fast-paced combat system and operatic soundtrack from Motoi Sakuraba aren't enough to save Valkyrie Elysium from a fate worse than Ragnarok: mediocrity.,,,,"For many, Valkyrie Elysium may be average at best. However, what ticks it up a notch for me are the themes, elements, and pieces of the Valkyrie franchise that I know and love. Many games have tried to copy the series, only to fall short and become little more than superficial knock-offs that take the combat and little else. Developer SoleiL has managed to take the soul of the Valkyrie games and put it into a new vessel. It may look and play differently, but it certainly has the heart of the series in it. Though Valkyrie Elysium is much better than I’d expected, I’m hopeful the next entry in the series will be less restrained and “safe,” opting for crazier and flashier instead. In the meantime, I’ll continue trying to will Valkyrie Profile 3: Hrist into existence. Maybe this time, it’ll work.","Despite the action trappings, Valkyrie Elysium shows deference to its spiritual ancestors in terms of aesthetic, tone, and emphasis on strategic use of allies in combat. Those looking for an expansive narrative will be disappointed as there is polish missing in the presentation and story, but that does not detract from an exhilarating combat system and enjoyable interactions between the Valkyrie and the Einherjar. Valkyrie Elysium may not be the game long-suffering fans have been asking for, but it represents an organic shift for the series that can appeal to fans and newcomers alike.",,"Valkyrie Elysium is an okay game with a fun battle system. Its biggest strength is that it’s fun to play when there are enemies on-screen. Everything else about it is relatively lackluster. This new take on the Valkyrie series is a solid gameplay foundation while leaving a lot of room for improvement in many other areas. Still, I think the developers at Soleil have done a decent job as newcomers taking their own interpretation of the series. I don’t think I’d want Valkyrie Elysium to completely overtake the Valkyrie Profile series moving forward, though I’d be happy with a peaceful co-existence as each strives to improve themselves - given that Square Enix greenlights more Valkyrie titles, of course.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
terminator-resistance---annihilation-line,,,,,,,,"Terminator: Resistance’s Annihilation DLC is a solid four-hour expansion to the main campaign. While it retains some of the foibles that kept the original experience from reaching a higher score, there is a lot to like about what this content brings both in the narrative and action. For Terminator fans that want to experience every piece of lore associated with the first two movies, this is a treat. However, if you found yourself burned out by the main game, then you may want to give this a miss as it is mostly more of the same.",,,,,"With some seriously neat moments that echo some key scenes from the first two films and at just over five hours in length, is a neatly digestible morsel that doesn't surprise or innovate in any sort of meaningful way, but instead gives us more of that Terminator: Resistance goodness. Essentially, if you're a Terminator fan and played Terminator: Resistance through to completion, enjoyed it and wanted to stay in that world, then Annihilation Line is absolutely your ticket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Annihilation Line doesn't solve the issues with Terminator: Resistance, such as its slightly clunky overall feel, but those fans who overlooked its lack of AAA polish won't mind that. Instead, the DLC refines what came before and doesn't have the same amount of technical problems that the core game had at launch. As such, for fans of the Terminator series who enjoyed Resistance, this is certainly something to enjoy.",,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’ve played Terminator: Resistance and found yourself wanting more, Annihilation Line is definitely worth considering. It doesn’t really try to offer anything new gameplay-wise, but it does allow you fight beside Kyle Reese and go behind the titular Annihilation Line. Those two factors alone will be enough to convince most fans.","Terminator: Resistance Enhanced is a game that doesn't really understand its source material. The evidence for that can't be made more plain than the way it can't even maintain consistency of vision from one mission to the very next one. The NPC models, audio, bugs and glitches, and repetitive nature of much of the play speaks to an implementation that falls short of any vision, whether the one presented or the one I believe should have been the goal. It does get better with the DLC, and the Infiltrator Mode is an excellent experience in it's own right, although one short lived - clocking in at less than three quarters of an hour with little replayabilty. But factoring in that minor triumph and better subplot of DLC into the mess of the main campaign still falls short of something I can really recommend.",,,,,,"If you were unimpressed by Terminator: Resistance, your mind will not be changed by Annihilation Line. For better or worse, it is more of the same. The cast mostly carries over, as do the mission types, enemies, and weapons. It’s a little more challenging, perhaps, and the pace is faster. Annihilation can’t compare to the best recent shooters, but it does have an audience. The ideal player might be a diehard Terminator fan eager for a compact few hours in their favorite sci-fi universe. Players who really liked the main game will enjoy the DLC as well. For everyone else, it’s probably a pass.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The main draw here is getting to spend time with Kyle Reese, and this standalone adventure does indeed succeed in rounding him out as a character. This being Terminator: Resistance, though, expect to see lots more Easter eggs sprinkled in. That’s why, much like before, Annihilation Line delivers another ho-hum FPS experience that only true franchise veterans will fully have fun with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

forspoken,,,"Overall, Forspoken is a failed experiment. The few moments of joy are rarely not succeeded by the most absolute boredom or by questionable gameplay decisions. Look for something else, really.","Away from its story missions, Forspoken feels short of ideas, and even the narrative runs out of steam. [Issue#382, p.102]",,"Forspoken is a disappointing game in so many ways. Dated on a whole bunch of points like the visual, it can't keep the player in suspense because of a badly told story and an open world that is unfortunately poor and hopelessly empty overall. The title of Luminous rings hollow despite successful gameplay and a universe that could have been much more generous and provided.","Forspoken is a massive open world game, and that's its biggest problem. It's unnecessarily big and there is not enough content and things to do to make up for this huge world, and even though the combat system, spell mechanisms and parkour gameplay are mostly solid, the final product feels shallow and unsatisfying.",,"I don't know what happened during the development of Forspoken, but this can't be what they were aiming for. The traversal, story and graphical elements of the game all suffer from the same issue: untapped potential.","Forspoken is an absolute disappointment with ridiculously cringe storytelling, a dead open world and lacklustre AI that prevents the creative combat system from really reaching its potential. With obnoxiously bad optimization for both PC and consoles, this is a game that just tries to be an average open-world experience with some assumed original twist but fails even to meet its mediocre expectations.",,,"Forspoken lacks the kind of refinement expected of a AAA title. If the concepts had received more attention, then the entire package would have been more cohesive. Still, despite its issues, there's definitely something here to enjoy if you can focus in on what the game does well: narrative, accessibility, and writing.","Forspoken is a magic-by-numbers game that is marred by a generic narrative. While the world of Athia can feel bland, the occasional spark of magic from the combat helps it along.","The focus went to combat which is fun and refreshing but enemies aren't varied enough for it to carry the whole game. There are many weak points in Forspoken... be it the mediocre side-content, or the repetition, or how unimpressive the game looks, etc. Storytelling disappoints too. Sure the game is ambitious, but the end result is far from being satisfying. Still, combat-focused lovers may find something to like here.","An adventure in which the need to conquer the lady and the altruistic obsession to save the world give way to more human interests, more visceral and easier to connect with.","Forspoken is somewhat reminiscent of the fusion cuisine that caused a furor in the average bistro in the early 1990s...The result is a potpourri of uncomfortably poorly written dialogue, a giant open world of cardboard and struggling to find 'meh' action and combat.","Nice fleshed combat and parkour, fun and very fast-paced fights. However, the open world and the activities within it are not as satisfying.","Forspoken is an ambitious title that builds both its fluid movement and its battle system around the concept of magic. From comfortable exploration to speedy combat, this unique open world action RPG has plenty of appeal, and its story that depicts the spiritual growth of its young New Yorker protagonist is immersive. That being said, the game does have issues, such as a lack of variety in side quests and a hub area that takes too much time to navigate through.","The story is cliched too and features far too many well-trodden gaming and movie tropes. So the freshness of what could have been in Forspoken isn’t realised. It’s a good game to play, just not a great game and that’s a shame.","Forspoken manages to stand out for its fantastic combat system and spectacular exploration in its open world. However, it clearly could have been better in other areas.","Despite the sheer amount of words that have been written about the game – including by me, I’ll acknowledge as I pass the 1,500 word mark on this review – the reality is that it’s just a forgettable, mediocre game. It does plenty of things very poorly, but it also does one or two things well enough that you can’t say it’s completely and irredeemably awful. There’s no real reason to seek the game out, and there’s no reason (apart, maybe, from that stupid talking bracelet) to avoid it at all costs: Forspoken is just kind of there.","So much of the design of Forspoken takes a starting template and duplicates it ad nauseum to the point the biggest incentive to do anything is to flesh out the magic. By the time the credits rolled after 15 hours of story (and a decent amount of side activities), there weren’t any compelling reasons to keep going and cross items off the checklist. Instead, it felt better to appreciate the things that were enjoyable about Forspoken and leave it at that.","Forspoken is on the precipice of something great. Behind the funneled narrative beats and the obese, sprawling world is a game that simply wants players to engage with its every part. Past the eye-rolling dialog and self-serious narrative is a potentially interesting protagonist and universe that occasionally mesh well. Each puzzle piece of Forspoken is so close to fitting and so often I could see the picture clearly, especially when bounding across the seemingly boundless landscape, making the screen quiver and explode with Frey’s awe-inspiring magic. Perhaps in another place, in another time, Forspoken will speak to everyone.","Despite its flaws, I enjoyed my time with Forspoken. While the narrative is janky at times, the premise is compelling and the world of Athia is exceedingly well-built. The movement is where the game shines, making exploration a joy instead of a chore. The postgame is also surprisingly competent when it comes to dealing with the implications of the main story’s twists and turns, a rarity for open-world games. I didn’t know what to expect when I started playing Forspoken but I came out feeling satisfied.","Forspoken shines brightest when its protagonist is dipping, ducking, and diving along the generally striking world of Athia while casting a variety of spells, but the standard fish-out-of-water fantasy story of Frey only subtracts from the experience.",,"Luminous Productions clearly had a vision for Forspoken, and it shines through brilliantly when the player is unshackled and left to their own devices in the gorgeous game world, buoyed by Forspoken's atmospheric music. Unfortunately, the narrative's pacing has left it feeling as though it was significantly scaled back during development. Forspoken is sprawling, awing in its scale, and a treat to look at, and while the gameplay is snappy and engaging, it's not necessarily impressive enough to completely distract from haphazard discussions with NPCs and a narrative that should have been given more space.","Forspoken is ambitious action RPG with the promise of a new world and gameplay possibilities, but some of them felt flat. Unambiguous heroine is a challenge but her view of the world is satisfying and there is a lot to fight for. Magic parkour and combat is solid, but controls are occasionally frustrating.",,,"In some respects Forspoken is a truly modern game that ditches the past generation and its limitations. Sadly, it turned out to be no more than a beautiful foundation ultimately used to create a benchmark rather than a compelling experience. I greeted the end credits with some relief and I’ll remember this game mainly as a case of a criminally wasted potential.",,"Given the opportunity to dare, Forspoken chooses to play it incredibly safe, with muddled pacing and strict adherence to both narrative and gameplay tropes holding it back from reaching its groundbreaking potential. Regardless, its dazzling visuals, charismatic leads, memorable boss battles, and energetic and varied combat will reward the more patient player with a solid, spellbinding adventure… And, for everybody else, there are magical cats.",,,"Forspoken is so uninspired and mired in cliches that its fantastic voice acting cast can only do so much to keep the game afloat. And while the movement and combat systems are interesting, they're often on the cusp of greatness without ever really realizing their full potential.","I’ll come back here and rate the game once I’ve finished the last chapter. However, I’m not convinced that it’s going to become any more magical and entertaining than it is now. It’s a shame, because the game starts from a good place: A new fantasy IP with a take-no-prisoners female protagonist. And I can tell that a lot of the people who worked on the game were sincerely trying. But I can also tell that several others very much were not.","Rough and ready, just like Frey, Forspoken is a tale worth stomping through one high-stakes, magic-infused battle at a time.","Early on, Forspoken‘s somewhat empty, barren world isn’t the most appealing. Stick with it, though, and you’ll be rewarded with more interesting landscapes, plenty of side content to sink your teeth into and a range of magical beasts itching for a fight. Frey makes a great protagonist, and we couldn’t help but be charmed by her punchy personality. But it’s her exhilarating parkour that really sets Forspoken apart. This open world adventure offers up the type of fun that’s hard to put down once you get started. We’re certainly keen to keep returning to Athia to mop up those remaining distractions.","Forspoken is absolutely fantastic. With all the spells you can unlock, the gear you can upgrade, the fights, the bosses, and a storyline that rivals the best video game stories, this isn't a return to form for SquareEnix, it's a testament that they still got it, and will have it for a very, very long time.","Did we really, really, really need a cat taming minigame? And you already told me the story of Athia at the start of the game. Why am I now ‘learning’ it again at the end of the game, strolling from point to point, pressing triangle for exposition. It’s a gorgeous game, but God if it’s not like a minorly insipid make-up artist’s Instagram grid. Loads of things to look at but no actual meaning in any of them.","There's something here to get stuck into for fans of open world adventures, and Forspoken isn't without its charms, but like Frey herself, it's often its own worst enemy.","What a shame that Luminous Productions didn’t capitalise on its best assets. Frey’s taken some heat for being overly chatty in Forspoken, but without Ella Balinska’s fantastic performance, the game would be totally forgettable.","Forspoken has a good foundation, but is a mess in execution due to a horrible protagonist, dull combat and technical problems. While there is enough to do in this pretty-looking open world it amounts to very little and so does the story.","Forspoken it's not the next gen game that we're waiting for, but it's not as bad as some found in the demo. It has its share of elements to improve, starting with the script, but it makes combat and traverse very fresh and enjoyable, in a world full of things to do, that invites to keep playing even after watching the ending credits.","Forspoken feels like a test that was turned in with answers missing, returned with a big red ""Finish Your Work"" inked at the top. So much of the game feels like unrealized potential, a big, messy first draft. There are too many mechanics, there's too much story, too much empty world, and too little chance for surprise or discovery. However, I can't say I didn't enjoy a lot of my time with Forspoken. When the combat clicks, it can be a lot of fun. Forspoken is ambitious, and there are hints of a winning formula. I hope the developers keep chipping away at what doesn't work. It would be a shame if Forspoken is forsaken.",,"While Forspoken has its fair share of glaring issues, I have to admit that I still enjoyed my time with its warts and all, as it managed to entertain and engage me with its combat system alone.","Forspoken is a unique game, with a very distinct gameplay, setting and story that compose a very fun and interesting experience. It suffers with its short duration, problemactic camera, lack of variety in side missions and it needs a few adjustments to its gameplay, but its one of the most beautiful games on the PS5 so far and a title that deserves everyone's attention.",,,"Forspoken isn't for everyone - and this is its strength. Games that spark controversy can be the most interesting. This seems a sign that the developers have successfully realized their vision. Such courage is commendable, especially in the era of clones.","Forspoken is an incredible title. Although the story suffers from being a bit too generic, the gameplay is inventive, magical, and an absolute blast. This is a game I’ll come back to again and again just to move around and exist in the fascinating fantasy world. Forspoken is an exciting leap forward for action games, and I can’t get enough of it.","It might not seem like it right now, but Forspoken had some very good ideas, and I ended up still having some fun with it. It feels like it needed a little more time to figure out its real identity instead of its disjointed little-of-this, little-of-that experience. I think it's true form, which it hinted at, is as a young-adult, Bayonetta-adjacent ass-kicker, that needs to pick a tone and lean into it. If that's what it had been, we'd be onto something.","Forspoken would like to share the personal story of a woman who was abandoned as a baby and how it shaped her as an adult. Unfortunately, that only half works. The other half tells a worn-out fantasy story in a (cliché) moderate way. Although there is more than enough to do and experience in Forspoken, the actual fun is sometimes hard to find.","Forskpoken isn't a bad game, but it isn't outstanding either. If you get interested in its universe, whether for its story or combat, it won't leave you indifferent. However, the game doesn't dazzle, and it might not meet the expectations of all players.","Forspoken offers a unique and thrilling experience with its impressive combat and smooth traversal mechanics. The story and open world may fall victim to the pitfalls of its genre and the largely formulaic side quest design only shines occasionally, but it's an overall satisfying and well-crafted action RPG with fast-paced and energetic gameplay.","Forspoken presents a genuinely human story blended well with combat and a variety of exploration options, setting it up to be PlayStation’s next big franchise.","Forspoken inspires with its parkour and combat system, but is otherwise only moderately convincing and gives away a lot of potential.",,"Forspoken is average. It has the highs and lows of an overall regular gaming experience. The nods to Alice in Wonderland, the combat and Frey Holland's story are pretty good, but the game fails to deliver next-gen visuals and a better storytelling experience. There are so many fades to black and cutscenes that you feel bored, especially during the first hours of gameplay.",,"If Forspoken had been a tech demo, it would have been amazing. As a game it is just a collection of inexplicable decisions that ruin the entire experience. The game - just as its hero - does not have a clearly defined identity, the pace is slow while the world is huge, the controls are clumsy at best, the animations are stiff, and the AI is limited to a few patterns. The around 30 hours required to complete the main story feel painfully long, and it is hard to justify investing twice as much time to uncover everything. You can see the hard work put in some aspects of the game, which makes it even harder to explain the neglect of the rest. Forspoken is nothing more than a foot note in an essay about wasted potential.","Square Enix did the right thing by investing in an entirely new franchise. But in the end, Forspoken is a huge disappointment with too many flaws to be a good game. A bland open world with forgets to shape its own identity, a poor writing and too many weakness from a technical point of view, coexist with some good gameplay mechanics like the spells and the parkour.",,"A competently made game, which unfortunately colors a little too much within the lines of the genre.",,"Forspoken should and could have been a better game than it actually is. Its strengths lie in its core gameplay, which is fast, fluid, and great fun at its best. However, unnecessary open world clutter hampers exploration, and the combat system only begins to hit its stride hours into the adventure. If you can push through a poorly paced story, packed with desperately dull characters, then you might find enjoyment in Frey's fantastical abilities, which undoubtedly steal the show both in and out of battle. It's not quite the disaster that the memes would have you believe, but it's certainly not the PS5 showpiece that was once promised, either.","You can spend hours completing spell challenges, exploring dungeons, fighting enemies, and activating altars to upgrade your powers. But that fun is often held back by the story. Forspoken's pacing could be better. The game takes you away from what you want to do. We often wanted to explore to our heart's content, but the game forced us to spend minutes that felt like forever in uninteresting storytelling.","A below average game that does nothing well. It’s ugly, it’s boring, I’m tired of it. Steer clear of this mess.","Forspoken has a great combat system, a cool way to move through the game world, minuscule loading times and is presented in an acceptable way. Unfortunately, the weak dialogues, the much too short story and the soulless open game world full of repetitive activities mean that the mediocre level is only surpassed at a few moments.","A litany of missed opportunities results in one of the most aggravating action role-players of recent years, with irritating characters, dull combat, and a frustrating movement system.","Forspoken is therefore an experience that takes time to reveal its potential, but which, once the controls have been mastered, offers to discover a pleasant open world thanks to the magical powers of Frey.",,"Forspoken is vibrant, experimental, and undercooked all at once. It feels like a throwback to the Xbox 360-era of Square Enix games that were weird and experimental, like The Last Remnant and Infinite Undiscovery, only with a much bigger budget and flashier visuals. Its traversal and combat mechanics shine, but they’re trapped underneath a story and setting that feels painfully average and completely unwilling to engage with more challenging themes.","Forspoken represented a huge risk taken by newcomer Luminous Productions. While the story may feel a bit contrived at times, the Flow method of traversal and combat more than makes up for it. Frey may annoy some people as the protagonist, but stringing together a chain of magical commands within just a few seconds while deftly avoiding incoming fireballs is rewarding, and ultimately, I came away from Forspoken having enjoyed my time helping the people of Athia.","While Forspoken delivers a solid action-based combat system and an array of challenging bosses, it fails to create an engaging narrative thanks to the surface-level characters and at times, unbearable dialogue. Not only that, the outdated open world feels like more of a checklist rather than an opportunity for exploration, leaving you yearning for landscapes from other games that are more memorable, and less lifeless. Ultimately, Forspoken lives or dies with its combat, so if you fell in love with it in the demo, it may be worth your time. However, if you’re looking for an engaging RPG that immerses you in its world with a strong main narrative and interesting side activities, this is certainly not it.",,"The parkour and combat systems are worth developing further. Unfortunately, the developers fail to embed this groundbreaking approach into a convincing overall concept. Great moments are repeatedly thwarted by a lack of polish, a dull game world and an incredibly sluggish story.",,,,,"Forspoken is a good idea that is unable to build the playable and narrative style to make it shine. We want to explore its world, but there's not much to do, nor does the story push you to do so. [Not Recommended]",,"Forspoken takes it time to get over a wobbly start, but there's something worthwhile here amongst the noise.",,"Forspoken deserves better than what shipped on January 24. The strength of its story and protagonist do outpace its many problems, but much like Frey’s early struggles in seeing her own greatness, it’s clouded by unfortunate circumstances.","Forspoken doesn’t do anything new for the open-world genre of games, but it does offer just enough to distinguish itself, mostly thanks to Frey and her magic spells, and a story that’s able to stick the landing. Or to translate this to Whedonspeak, “Yep, she really did just do that!""","Forspoken’s final hours feature a bizarre difficulty curve, where I found myself absolutely destroying certain bosses before the full dialogue could even play out, only to then be pitted against the big bad who, among other things, featured a one-hit kill cleverly disguised as a cutscene.","Where Forspoken should’ve been a striking and appealing fresh start for Luminous Productions, the end result sadly is a game not only bland and unpolished, but deprived of a reason to care for its unfolding mystery. A bevvy of technical inconsistencies, lackluster open world design and most disappointing of all, a handful of systems with genuine enjoyment at times that don’t see their potential fully realized.",Want to explore a beautiful and desolate fantasy world without being stomped into the ground by every enemy you meet? The power fantasy of 'Forspoken' might just be the game for you.,"Forspoken has a good foundation, with great combat design and parkour, but the contents of this world are not as good and, consequently, struggle to keep the player engaged.","Forspoken fails to impress in several ways. Almost every good aspect of the game has a negative flip side. Though Forspoken isn't a bad game, the problems it does have hold it back from being great. All in all, Forspoken is just okay.","Forspoken was once one of the big reveals for the PS5 in 2020, but aside from using the SSD for open world magical parkour and the ultra quick fast travel, it is difficult to really see how it takes advantage of the latest console generation. The world of Athia looks good, and the combat is full of flashy magic, but there's no major side quests to divert from repetitive activities and a predictable main story.","Those who stick out Forspoken until the end may derive enjoyment from how certain elements were tackled like I did, though, ultimately, it’s all too little too late. At the very least, exploring the open world and completing optional tasks after completing the story can be fun, albeit in brief doses, since there’s not much of interest within the environments.","As a new title from Luminous Productions six years after FFXV, Forspoken continues to show the shortcomings of its open-world design. The abundance of magical combat and the still-excellent story make up for most of these shortcomings. However, the hopes for a fantastic magical world cannot be fulfilled.","Forspoken is a fun action RPG when it gets out of its own way. Its linear narrative and heavy-handed first few hours sap the player’s goodwill, before letting you free and realising its true potential. Strong combat and traversal mechanics really shine, and by the end, even the story manages to rise, like Frey herself, to the challenge.","Rather than letting its awful story simply be a good excuse for its excellent gameplay, Forspoken insists on constantly interrupting your fun to throw some truly bad exposition your way. Forspoken's character building and lore are a disaster but it manages to make it up with its incredible combat and traversal mechanics.",,"Truly a waste of potential. Forspoken gets saved by its spectacular combat and traversal mechanics, but the value of those systems gets skewered by a disappointing story and a trite open world structure. It's still a fun experience if you love experimenting with combat and magic, but we sincerely hope to see those systems recycled for something less rushed in the future.","There was a moment in which we really feared for the success of Fospoken, which, due to a not exactly crystal clear communication from the publisher, often ended up making us feel mixed sensations. Confirming the impressions gained on the occasion of previous direct contacts with the product, however, the new creature of Luminous Productions convinces in every respect, without excelling in any field. While the staid pace of the isekai matrix plot is counterbalanced by surprising twists and turns that leave a love flavor, the albeit chaotic combat system and the exorbitant number of optional activities offered by an open world that is anything but empty compensate for a surrender visual not quite state of the art.","Forspoken is a game of ups and downs. The title is much more focused on the story than on the open world component and this is not a bad thing at all. The narrative is enjoyable, but not without flaws, while the open world is very classic in style without particular flashes of originality.","Forspoken isn't without its hiccups—hit-or-miss side quests...and repetitive activities. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my time with Forspoken's focal storyline. The graphics, voice acting, and musical score are phenomenal, and the cat content is a lovely addition.",,"Forspoken is packed with flaws — be they outright missteps or simply middling executions — but there are definitely qualities to this game that can deliver an entertaining and sometimes thrilling experience. I did ultimately enjoy my time with it, all told and considered. There’s interesting lore here, and at times the story approaches compelling, but it was held back so much by odd design choices, an often bland world, and uneven pacing in both the story and moment-to-moment dialogue. On paper, it could and should be great, but nothing quite fits together to make a stronger whole. It’s crammed with so much, and beyond the combat and traversal, the whole experience just winds up feeling like something of a relatively enjoyable mess.","Despite its flaws, Forspoken is a fun adventure that nails the minute-to-minute gameplay with Frey’s parkour abilities and magic spells.","Forspoken may have some merits, in terms of combat design and the magic parkour, but it is also, unfortunately, one of the most derivative games we have seen in many years in terms of open world design as well as questing. Especially the secondary quests are joyless and devoid of any redeeming value.",,,"In the cut-throat race for your attention, Forspoken feels like a new IP that’s trying to run full pelt alongside heavy-hitting franchises from other big publishers. But it ploughs, shin-first, through every hurdle along the way. Its stuttering start belies a combat system that’s worth investing the effort to learn, but takes so long to get up to full speed that it’s already on borrowed time.","In the end, Forspoken is okay, with its world, parkour, and combat as its high points. And while I didn’t thoroughly enjoy the story, I want to see Ella Balinksa as Frey again in a sequel as her performance (and, frankly, the majority of the cast) was a definite highlight, despite the poor writing she was given. Unfortunately, the performance issues really have made Forspoken hard to recommend at its full price, as it negatively impacts so much of the moment-to-moment gameplay. Hopefully with a few patches Square and Luminous can improve it over time. But until then, traveling down the rabbit hole into Athia might be best done on a sale.","Forspoken’s flashy combat and parkour can be fun, but they aren’t enough to make its cliche story and barebones open world very interesting to explore.",Magical world with exciting and thrilling story that eventually delivers. But until it does deliver it feels forever. A must play for those who love action paced fluid combat and enjoy different vibrant colours but can overlook and tolerate few cheap scripts and few silly bugs.,,,"While Forspoken is a much better time than chatter on social media might suggest, those who opt to take on Frey’s journey will likely encounter bumps and stumbles that are hard to ignore, as well as have to deal with some unpleasant traveling companions strapped to their arms. Folks who can put up with those shortcomings, though, will find a dramatic and very pretty adventure as a stranger running freely across a strange land.",,"Even with its unfortunate first impression, I’d (heartily) recommend Forspoken. Its exceptional gameplay is more than enough to make it worth playing and is all the more noteworthy, given it’s a fresh new IP. If nothing else, it lays the groundwork for a new series that has plenty to build from and could go on to be remembered for far more than some rough dialogue.","Forspoken is both ambitious, yet incredibly flawed. It pairs hammy dialogue and some poor pacing with a world I want to explore. Forspoken is a game tied between two worlds - losing out by never quite understanding either.","It’s a shame that the early pacing issues with Forspoken and the slow-burn drip-feeding of abilities will likely put off a lot of players and prevent them from seeing how fun the game can actually be when it’s firing on all cylinders. Bland and boring environments with some awkward visual choices and lifeless character models give an unfortunate first impression that is saved by its enjoyable parkour and versatile combat during the later stages of the game, along with a surprisingly heartfelt story. Forspoken might not be the savior we were all hoping for, but it’s a decent adventure with enough soul that it shouldn’t be cast aside entirely.",,"The technology, which is impressive in places, stumbles over questionable design decisions, an uninspired game world and a combat system that is only visually exciting.","While the cheerful combat with cool parkour moves were exceptionally fun, Forspoken has been lacking in so many ways for players who have endured its delay announcement for twice. All those cute cats fill Frey's room only serve to double the loneliness that is already been full in Athian world.",Forspoken is undoubtedly a game that fails to attract interest. It has simple textures and unpolished graphics. The color palette in the environment is very limited and gives us the impression that everything is very dark. The plot is straightforward and highly predictable; perhaps it is the typical storyline that we have played countless times in different games. The gameplay is indeed the most valuable aspect of this game because it keeps us interested and helps to make the experience more enjoyable.,,"To say that Forspoken is a disappointment may seem harsh, but it's also not something that's far from the truth. It's not that Luminous Productions made a bad game, they just put out one that isn't particularly good either. It will be a run-of-the-mill release that will earn some fans for its strengths, but will fail to transcend.","Forspoken is neither black nor white, it's a mottled gray of spectacular combat and magical parkour to be experienced within a dated open world.","Forspoken barely avoids disaster thanks to its gameplay and its two main characters, two aspects that are not without their faults either. Its few good ideas simply don't manage to make up for its huge shortcomings: Luminous' title quickly gets bogged down in a rousing structure, which will take you through areas that are certainly huge, but empty of interest. The activities all look the same, the level design is very poor, as is the bestiary... In short, it is impossible for us to recommend it at full price.","Forspoken's story and combat fail to reach the heights of its movement and exploration, but thankfully those two latter elements make up most of the experience. I sprinted, often literally, through the campaign in about 15 hours, and now I have a large world filled with nooks and crannies I'm eager to run through and explore. The narrative won’t linger with me, and I avoided combat in the open world often, but I loved making Frey leap and fly through Athia to discover all its treasure chests and secrets.","There's a lot I can't get over with Square Enix, but the fact that they made such a big investment in a new brand was a big deal for me. If only Forspoken could have taken the opportunity given by Square Enix much better. At least we still have Final Fantasy XVI on the horizon, right?",,"Forspoken feels like a breath of fresh air for open-world adventures with its stylish engine, but is held back by pacing and other foibles.","Forspoken is a game that has great potential, expressed in a precise, fast and fun combat system. Sadly, everything else in the game lacks novelty or interest in exploration.",,"This damn thing should have been linear. It absolutely, positively, should have been linear, and in decades past, before the game industry had boiled everything down to a handful of trends, it would have been. You could have had the parkour, you could have had the combat, and on top of that you could have had some real direction, pacing, and a streamlined experience without so much self-defeating fluff. It should have been linear.","As Luminous Productions’ first project after being formed from the developers of Final Fantasy XV, Forspoken is a remarkable yet flawed experience. There’s so much potential here, with an outstanding magic parkour system and a beautiful open world. However, it’s clear that the ambition was a little too high for this studio, as there are just too many incomplete (but great) ideas at work here that just don’t come to fruition.",,,Forspoken feels like an unfinished game with a lot of untapped potential. It looked like an indie game that came out that way due to budget constraints when it could have been so much better.,,"Forspoken falls into all the traps set by the design of an action adventure game in an open world, where linking narration and gameplay is a very difficult alchemy. A game that really only begins when it ends.","After all is said and done, Forspoken emerges as a solid new IP. It has its fair share of issues, but the longer you spend time in Athia, the more its world draws you in with its intriguing combat and the simple pleasure of freely crossing massive environments with spellbinding abilities. Luminous Productions is definitely onto something with this concept, it just needs a bit more focus and refinement. At the very least, Forspoken proves its worth on its own terms, and demonstrates the potential to someday hang alongside Square Enix’s staple franchises.","Forspoken would be a passable PlayStation title if it were released a decade ago, but it drops the ball as a contemporary AAA game due to its awkward voice performances, muddy visuals, and many bizarre design choices.","It's a shame, because Forspoken's terrible story and its unlikable main character largely bog down what's otherwise a competent action RPG. There's a foundation for something good here, but it sadly doesn't realize that potential.","Despite some moments of genuine enjoyment, with a combat system that does its best to entertain, Forspoken never makes the most of its potential. Ultimately, there are bigger, bolder and more inventive action games both already out there and soon to be upon us in an already stacked 2023 release schedule.","Forspoken is visually stimulating and a musical delight, but boring combat, poor characterization, and loose movement mechanics make for a mediocre experience.","Add to this a less-than-likeable Frey who barely manages to endear herself upon the player, and even less likeable NPCs and a bland, bland game-world I have no desire to learn more about, let alone live in (take me back to New York and my real-world troubles there, please), and you have a game that just… lacks.","Forspoken is a game that clearly has cool ideas. It just can't manage to reach the level it aspires to operate at, which is really disappointing. An annoying main character that bogs down a somewhat compelling story, frenetic combat, but weak AI to fight against, and a satisfying traversal system in a dull open world make it clear that every interesting thing comes with a caveat. All of that makes it all the more painful, because you can see the heights this game could reach if it wasn't constantly getting in its own way.","Forspoken is a solid action RPG that sadly falls short due to some of its design. The world is just not that interesting to explore and the weird dialogue can detract from an otherwise interesting narrative. I enjoyed my time with the game and if you do dive in, I recommend simply mainlining the core story as it keeps the repetition to a minimum. If you are a sucker for tons of mindless side content though this game has it in spades. I truly wish it was just more interesting though.","Despite all of those missteps, Forspoken skirts by on the merits of its traversal, combat, and upgrade systems. It won’t win any awards come the end of the year, but it's a decent podcast game, the type of title you can play while consuming other content in the background, all without feeling like you’re missing too much.",,"There’s nothing bespoke about Forspoken’s world, which is why it’s so hard to get caught up in its atmosphere, no matter how it feels to play. It’s a long-haul montage of middling action movie trailers beamed directly into your skull, and you don’t even get to watch a cracking film at the end of it. I’m sure the mechanical joy hiding under its disjointed set dressing will be worth it for some, but it feels like the kind of flat tire that is destined to have its ‘so bad its good’ merit extolled in YouTube videos later down the line. It’s a rare miss for Square Enix, as its big RPGs usually tend to find an audience, even if they do have a bit of jank about them, but I’m not sure Forspoken even knows who it’s targeting.","I would recommend Forspoken to action and RPG fans, but I wish I could give them one of my save files with total open-world freedom and most of the traversal and combat spells unlocked from the jump. The adventure is at its weakest when it's forcing players to wade through lots of poor narrative content that takes too long to pay off. Its best beats aren’t paced or delivered well and serve as a weighty vambrace holding back this game’s true magic: a dazzling open-world game that truly does feel next-gen.",,,,There’s a fascinating story and incredible parkour action buried under lackluster combat and a game lacking technical polish.,,,"Forspoken is a fun action game that shines best when you're taking advantage of the great magic parkour to soar through the fantasy world of Athia and blast enemies with overwhelmingly cool spells. However, its content is underwhelming, its RPG systems are weak, and its visuals are less advanced than advertised. As such, Forspoken's potential is largely unrealized in its current state. It's still a decent romp for genre fans to go through, though waiting until it gets a discount or is added to one of the many subscription services is recommended.",,,,"Forspoken is a far better and more compelling game than I had feared, but it also doesn’t reach the heights I dreamt of. There is a lot of fun to be had exploring Athia and the main quest keeps things interesting even when you get bored with the open-world checklist. But at the same time I can’t help but be disappointed with how safe Forspoken plays the open world, and I am unlikely to go back to clear out all of those rote points of interest. And I also can’t deny there are some eyebrow-raising moments as to how the writers chose to portray a black woman like Frey, despite personally liking her quite a bit when viewed through the lens of having finished the game. There is a lot of diversity in the cast too, in a way we don’t usually get from big-budget RPGs. I am not sure how many steps forward versus how many steps back Forspoken takes, but there are steps taken forward. In the end, I recommend Forspoken to anyone who loves Final Fantasy XV or Ubisoft-style open worlds and especially anyone who has a thing for character mobility. Yet, the game has a certain charm that I believe makes it worth giving a try to anyone.",,,,,,,,,,"There's a lot to love about Forspoken despite its technical issues. It makes up for that with great traversal, a fantastic DualSense implementation, and solid storytelling. It might not be for everyone, but I enjoyed my time in Athia and will be checking out the story DLC when it launches in the future.",,,"Forspoken is a disappointing outing from a developer that touts 'key members' of the Final Fantasy XV team, one which feels at best uninterested in its Black protagonist, and at worst resentful of her.","Forspoken is fun to play most of the time, but it's a damn shame that the game's remaining elements eagerly attempt to ruin that enjoyment at every turn.","Forspoken is a disappointment on many levels, including those that can't be fixed with an update. It's a great shame, because Square Enix's open world adventure definitely had potential. It's not a complete write-off, but the quality is simply too far from other high-budget AAA releases it strives to imitate.","My time with Forspoken was a strange one. Elements of the game are fantastic, with an engrossing story and a gorgeous world. However, it all just feels segmented, like nothing really wants to work together. Forspoken is a good game and one I would recommend to most open-world fans, but it just feels so close to greatness that I can’t help but walk away disappointed.",,,,,,,"Despite enjoying some aspects though, Forspoken was unfortunately overall an incredibly disappointing experience. I can absolutely see it working for those who just want an open world with things to tick off, but any form of substance beyond busy work is severely lacking within the world of Athia. It was rather unsurprising to see the game label its side quests as 'detours' - momentary distractions from the driving path. But you quickly figure out once you rejoin the main road that it is, unfortunately, leading to very little.","It’s always going to be on my desktop or my PlayStation, and I’m gonna keep going back to it every once in a while because it’s really relaxing to hold down the parkour button and go through this huge world to unlock stuff and find new quests.","With better pacing, slightly lighter tone and some self-restraint Forspoken would have been a much better game.",,,"The breezy combat with lots of spells and the beautiful acrobatics are fun — it’s just a shame the same can‘t be said of the story or setting … Still, I find myself wishing that Luminous get the opportunity to build upon what they have, working towards a more modern, lively adventure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
aragami-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aragami 2 could be a good stealth game, with a good foundation of stealth gameplay and even an intriguing story, but it is plagued by constant bugs, performance issues, poor level design, pacing, rough implementation of gameplay mechanics and a visual style that only further serves to make its flaws even more evident then they already are.",,,,,,,,"Aragami 2 is a very linear stealth experience that gives too much power to the player, making it extremely easy to overcome any kind of challenge the game throws at you. Repetitive missions and buggy performance make it a hassle to play through.",,,,,,,"Aragami 2 ends up being a bit of a mixed bag as a gaming experience. On one hand, the stealth mechanics, outstanding skill tree and playground-esque level designs means that the core gameplay is a blast. On the other hand, the new combat system isn't great, repetitive mission objectives and map reuse is maddening, and the bugs certainly don't help matters. The new addition of co-op has potential to make missions more fun by working with a friend, but this is purely speculation as Screen Rant was not able to test the feature as of writing this review. Stealth fans should find enough to enjoy about Aragami 2, but be prepared for a few stumbles along the way.",,,,"Aragami 2 was released in an abysmal state. Tons of bugs and lame AI made it pretty much impossible for me to enjoy the two main improvements over the original game – increased focus on the co-op mode and enhanced character mobility. I was also disappointed by boring mission design, as the tasks I had to tackle made the impression as if RNG worked on them.

Until then though, you might want to think twice before diving in. While it’s initially fun nipping around Aragami 2‘s maps thanks to traversal options such as shadow leap, and later unlockable abilities really empower you, repetition does take its toll on the experience. All the while, frequent bugs and technical issues make you wonder if you’re playing something that was ready to step into the light for all to see.",,,"Aragami 2 is wonderful when you're being a ninja, but one-on-one encounters are poor, and a lack of variety lets it down.",,,,"Aragami 2 is an adventure that can be enjoyed by stealth fans and anyone who wants to try infiltrating an enemy base with satisfying results. Even if you’re bad at stealth games, Aragami 2 encourages you to create your own path and explore different ways to tackle a challenge. Sometimes close combat is my jam, and other times I just want to avoid confrontation. The many ways to experience Aragami 2 made it feel less catered to one specific audience and more towards anyone who is interested in trying a stealth experience. While the plot isn’t all that engaging, it is satisfying in its own way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Is Aragami 2 rough around the edges? You bet. Does it lack challenge? Unfortunately.

In fact, its arcade-style approach to stealth gameplay had me hooked and I'm looking forward to more sneaky action.",,,"Aragami 2 tries to add a layer of co-op action on top of its core stealth gameplay. Funny enough the stealth and combat mechanics are anything but co-op friendly. It feels like a half-baked release, with the developers having no clear direction how to continue the first game. It has its moments in co-op, but even those are ruined by the glitches and bugs. After the first few hours it becomes a repetitive grind and there is no real motivation for anyone to finish it. Aragami 2 is a completely unworthy and unmemorable sequel.",Aragami 2 manages to offer a classic infiltration game that offers a very dynamic gameplay thanks to very fast movements. It does feel quite repetitive with dull missions and only a handful of maps to play.,,,,"Ultimately, poor combat fails to sour the strong level and encounter design here that meshes beautifully with well-thought-out controls and plenty of mechanical variety. An impressive sequel, but perhaps lacking the purity of its predecessor.",,,,"A bigger, more ambitious stealth sequel which revamps the original’s mechanics and personality but most of the changes are to the game’s detriment.","With its simple and nervous gameplay, Aragami 2 offers a classic infiltration experience but of formidable efficiency. Add to this the many skills available to players, and the levels can be crossed with great ease for an exhilarating sensation. Unfortunately, the title suffers alongside a lack of variety which gives the feeling of always repeating the same levels over and over despite their large size and barely different objectives. We also regret the change of artistic direction for a result less captivating than in the first part and which reveals a fairly simple technique. Nonetheless, it remains a nice and effective infiltration game that will surely gain in depth thanks to its multiplayer mode.",,,"Aragami 2 had potential to be a great follow up to an indie classic released five years ago. Unfortunately it lacks any real challenge and feels bloated with repetitive mission types and locations. The game starts to overstay its welcome after a while, but there’s definitely fun to be had before reaching that stage if you can put up with the plenty of bugs that still need to be fixed.",,,,,,,"Feeling excellent in the hands, it’s a shame that the repetitive missions almost entirely feel like side-quests, seemingly hampered to fit the multiplayer vision. [Issue#7, p.75]",,,,,,,,,,"Whilst not revolutionary, this sequels improves over the foundations of the original, with a greater, better focus on multiplayer and replayability.",,,"Aragami 2 will surely scratch any itch that you’re looking for within the stealth action genre. Laying waste to unsuspecting enemies with your buddies and jumping from rooftop to rooftop provides a certain sense of satisfaction. Unfortunately, however, the other systems can’t keep up with this action, leaving the narrative, AI, and overall game loop to simply exist in hopes the play doesn’t get lost in the shadows.",,,,,,,"Although an intriguing atmosphere, Aragami 2 can't stand out as the first game did and some choices in level design make it feel more linear than it should.",,,"The appealing character designs and settings, carried over from its predecessor, have lost stylistic flare alongside repetitive missions. However, Two Feathers’ score, pretty backgrounds, and smooth sneaking are the sequel’s saving grace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Coming off the first game, the hope was that the sequel would expand upon the hardcore stealth mechanics, and it would have worked a treat with Aragami 2’s larger levels. The increase in co-op partners make for more ways to have fun, and being able to see how certain groups tackle things silently or with all-out mayhem could have given the community more to strive for. The new direction in Aragami 2 is not a bad thing at all, considering the general quality present, but perhaps giving players the option between this new style and the old would have made this sequel a more complete package worth killing for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aragami 2 is a bold and aggressive take on the stealth genre, when it finds the confidence to step out of the shadows.

vampire-the-masquerade---swansong,,,,,,,,,,"Swansong will be compared to Bloodlines, and that’s inevitable even though this is not the same kind of game. Unfortunately, Swansong wants itself to be compared to Bloodlines and doesn’t really make a stand against its older sire. A mess of RPG and adventure mechanics boil down to luck, and with weak voice acting and not very Camarilla vampire models, Swansong leaves a lot to be desired. If you’re looking for an adventure akin to Life is Strange, you’ll surely find it here. But if you’re looking for a World of Darkness RPG with deep and charismatic characters, better hope Bloodlines 2 comes out soon.",,,"In the end, despite its penchant for occasionally boring puzzles, rough character animations and wildly varying voice performances, Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong is nonetheless a roundly fulfilling detective adventure with a vampiric twist that will appeal greatly to anyone that follows the World of Darkness setting. For others, Swansong makes for a fine, if occasionally clunky introduction to that sprawling world of supernatural politics and generation spanning stories.","Vampire the Masquerade Swansong is a top-tier narrative-focused adventure set in the World of Darkness that offers complex characters and a fascinating world. However, performance issues on PS5 mar what could have been a sublime experience.",,,,"Ambitious on paper, Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong is one of those games that runs up against a budget that limits its good ideas. Technically, this Masquerade needs an overhaul, improved animations and textures. And in the gameplay there is a certain imbalance in sections such as puzzles and basic tasks that only extend the duration without contributing anything. But as a Vampire game it's worth it, especially in its deployability, because the world of The Masquerade is really well implemented. If you're a fan, give it the Embrace and become its Sire while you wait for the arrival of the messiah Bloodlines 2.",,,,"As I said up top, I get that it’s a little unfair to come into a series that’s been around for a couple of decades and complain that you don’t know what’s going on. But at the same time, the more you play of Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong, the more you get the sense that it’s being so convoluted because it doesn’t know what else to do. It tries to wrap everything together sometime around the 15-hour mark, but there’s really no reason why you should want to stick around for that long.",,"Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong is a dialogue and story-driven experience with a side of detective to help push it all along.

The developers could have made a stat-heavy action thing, or followed a bunch of other games and thrown players into a generic open-world that barely resembles or is relevant to the base material. They didn’t, and the game is better for it.

I can appreciate an entirely combat-free RPG, but I think that you’re going to have to do more than occasionally let players unlock certain dialogue choices or bypass locks by leveling up specific skills. I’m not too worried, though. This series has been going on for a long time, and while this game may have Swansong in its title, I doubt it’s the last Vampire: The Masquerade game we’ll be seeing.

The strength of the narrative-based gameplay, bringing a rare weight to choices, successes, and failures, will give any fan of narrative or adventure games something to enjoy, even if the tedium of exploration will likely wear on players at least a bit.

You’ll no doubt enjoy taking in the picturesque scenery and listening to the game’s wonderful soundtrack, and there are some pockets of fun to be found. If you’re after something a little bit different and have a lot of patience, give it a try, especially if you like foxes. If not, steer clear, or maybe pick it up in a sale.",,,,,,,"Even as a fairly short game, Spirit of the North managed to accomplish what it had set out to achieve – to tell us a story without words and to slow us down. A truly unique experience where the visuals and music were its greatest strengths, it shows that a game does not have to be filled with excitement for it to be gratifying. It wasn’t a perfect adventure, but it served as an important reminder to always be curious about your surroundings, to take your time, and to stop and smell the flowers.",,"Is Spirit of the North worth playing? Despite the previous few paragraphs of ranting, I think it is. There’s genuine beauty in the design of the environments and the way the world is brought to life, which is really quite extraordinary. Also, that soundtrack is just superb and pairs well with the quiet isolation of the fox’s cross-country journey. Just be prepared for some awkward 3D platforming and make sure you’ve got a walkthrough nearby for when you inevitably get stuck at a dead end.",,,,,"Spirit of the North may look beautiful, sound beautiful, but is a confusing and boring mess. It tries too hard to be artsy while disregarding the importance of fun gameplay and an interesting story. During their short playtime, players are required to interpret the weak narrative and their overall purpose in the game. The only replayability comes from completing the collect-a-thon. However, that provides zero satisfaction to the player and has a hard time trying to stay relevant to the gameplay and story at large.","Spirit of the North: Enhanced Edition is a beautiful remaster of an average game. If you enjoy wandering around pretty environments and solving some light puzzles, then this is a fantastic ""chill out"" game, but anything beyond that is somewhat forgettable. Add on some frustrating bugs and the lack of meaningful improvements over the last-gen version beyond visuals, and it isn't a must-buy for anyone who has played the original title. It's worth experiencing if you haven't played it before, but you should perhaps wait for a price drop, since the $35 price tag isn't worth it when you can purchase a last-gen copy for $20.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Infuse Studio has done a fantastic job in remastering Spirit of the North’s visuals for PS5, but while it looks gorgeous, this edition neglects the elements that needed an update most.

If you’ve been searching for a new adventure game, Spirit of the North is short but sweet and despite these flaws, comes recommended.",,,,,,,,"Exploring Iceland as a furry fox friend has been a real treat. It’s delicious eye candy with a satisfyingly chewy center. Yes, there were times when I hoped for a little more direction in solving puzzles. Those brand new help cards on the PlayStation 5 dashboard sure would have been nice (fingers crossed we see those when the game officially releases). That said, Spirit of the North is too beautiful and captivating to be disappointed for long.

Essentially, what is on offer here is a beautiful relaxing experience accompanied by a haunting and fitting soundtrack. Occasionally some sort of gameplay element and extremely light puzzling will be experienced, although this is often hampered by janky controls and glitching. The sheer gorgeousness of the world old red inhabits is worthy of admission alone, and the overall style and presentation of the package is what elevates this from ""leave well alone"" to ""give it a lazy Sunday try."" If already owning the original release, there's nothing here to justify jumping back in for, but for newcomers looking for something a bit different, certainly consider giving this fox a fumble.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Spirit of the North: Enhanced Edition is a short and lighthearted adventure that boasts a good visual department but is crippled by several annoying technical problems.,,,,,,,,,"When it comes to presentation, Spirit of the North: Enhanced Edition is a treat and a real step up from the previously released versions of the game.

But as much as I wanted to smash up giant robots with my own mech monster, the limitations of Super Mech League left me cold.",,,,,"Giant mech battles are nothing new to the gaming scene. Unfortunately, also not new is that the genre has few examples of quality mech-battling gameplay. Override 2: Super Mech League recently added its name to the fray, bringing hectic arena combat to PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. Although fun at times, it’s ultimately hard to recommend this particular arena fighter over other fighting games that are also available right now, unless you REALLY like mechs. After saving the planet from an intergalactic threat, giant mechs battle it out in arenas for the pleasure of the people they saved. These giant robots - controlled by a human pilot - vary in size and stature, ranging in everything from beefy and strong to smaller and elusive. You’re the newbie on the mech-fighting circuit, seeking to make a name for yourself as you rise through the ranks and gain influence and rewards in various Mech Leagues. via Modus Override 2’s career campaign has everything you need to experience the game’s various game modes. 1v1, 2v2, 4v4 free-for-all… even a King of the Hill mode is available to you as you duke it out as one of the game’s 20 different robots. Each mech has a handful of different moves while having a special Ultimate ability available to them once their special meter bar is full. Of course, just because your Ultimate is ready, it doesn’t mean an automatic hit. Therein lies part of the game’s frustrations: the controls. Related: Hitman 3 Review - Slick, Stylish, Smooth I never expect a mech game to have the tightest of controls. They are giant mechanical robots, after all. However, I feel like Override 2: Super Mech League just isn’t sure what kind of game it’s trying to be. I’d love to say that this game feels like a legitimate, heavy-geared robot fighting game, but it just doesn’t. There are times when controlling your robot feels great - like you’re behind the wheel, levers, or whatever it is that you use to control a giant mech. Then, there are times when the hand-to-hand combat - which rewards combo attacks - is fun and exciting. But there’s never a good mix of the two mechanics. Often, this results in you attempting to make some sort of offensive attack, but the wonkiness of the robot’s controls causing your robot to veer off in the wrong direction. As such, there is a lot of button-mashing that takes place, which really doesn’t work well from a strategy standpoint. via Modus Battles also include weapons that randomly drop around the arena, such as laser blasters and giant melee weapons. Weapons are limited-use items that eventually disappear. That said, some of the melee weapons well outstay their welcome. I have won multiple matches from trapping my opponent in a loop of being hit with my melee weapon, with them being unable to escape. For some reason, the weapon’s limited usage is greatly extended, allowing me to take full advantage. It’s an incredibly cheap way to win, and an even worse way to lose (speaking from experience). Not a great mechanic for any fighting game to have. This extends into the game’s online multiplayer component, which features the same game modes that are available offline. Online matches can be fun and more challenging than single-player mode, but actually connecting to an online match can take a very long time, that is if you’re even able to connect. There just aren’t enough players playing the game, leaving much to be desired in terms of replayability. https://youtu.be/cIWzzAzmUxU The main selling point of Override 2: Super Mech League is its playable robots. If you’re a fan of kaiju or large-scale mech battles, you’ll likely enjoy this game. This is especially true with the game’s DLC character of Ultraman. Override 2 offers plenty of fun characters to play as in the base game, but Ultraman shines as one of the most enjoyable characters to play as. It’s a shame that Ultraman is locked behind a paywall (in the form of coming with the Deluxe Edition of the game), as he should really be a major selling point for the game. Ultimately, your Override 2: Super Mech League experience will boil down to one simple factor: if you’re playing the game for its take on giant mecha/kaiju arena combat, you’re probably going to enjoy Override 2. Unfortunately, with its control woes and small online player base, Override 2: Super Mech League just doesn’t really have anything else to offer for fans of the fighting genre in general.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Override 2: Super Mech League is a great local and online multiplayer 3D brawler. With a ton of moves, a huge roster of cool and unique characters, and flashy special effects, Override 2 offers hours of fun.

But when battling friends at home or online, Override 2 can’t be beat.",,,,,"Override 2 shows great character design in its twenty (plus Ultraman as a DLC) giant robots, and the combat system is simple, yet fun.

It’s easier to grasp, much faster paced and far more dynamic. Fans of the first game might not gel with these changes which make it more akin to a traditional fighting game. Despite the tweaks and a lack of game modes, this game manages to bombastically portray destructive kaiju battles in a very satisfying way.",,,,"Override 2: Super Mech League has failed to expand the good ideas of its predecessor, because the absence of the single-player campaign adds a limited play offer on several fronts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite some changes from the previous chapter, Override 2: Super Mech League is a decent fighting game that can count on a larger roster of robots and a gameplay suitable for everyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With revamped combat and a slick presentation, Super Mech League is a vast improvement over the original in many ways, though a lack of content might limit the amount of time you spend with this robot rumbler.",,,,,,"Great mech design and accessibility cannot save Override 2: Super Mech League from it’s weightless, lifeless gameplay. The maps often come across as too small, leading to cluttered fights that really affect the games flow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Override 2: Super Mech League skirts the lines between good and bad without ever settling on either side. The online play is a nice touch to make the Leagues actually feel like there’s something at stake if you can actually find anybody to play with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Override 2: Super Mech League is a great sequel, and by removing Mech City Brawl’s more tedious elements, Modus Games have created a thoroughly enjoyable 3D brawler. With more refined gameplay, improved performance, and a great roster of mechs, this isn’t a simple rehash of the original. Though Leagues can be repetitive in solo play and it holds infrequent performance issues, there lies a fun multiplayer experience here for Kaiju fans that comes highly recommended."
bright-memory-infinite,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In the end, Bright Memory: Infinite feels like an advert for a much larger, much more ambitious game and the price tag (around $15 or so), reflects that.

But a lacklustre story and repetitive pacing coupled with unnecessary additions such as the skills makes Bright Memory: Infinite an uneven and jarring experience. Perhaps in the near future, given a bigger budget, developer FYQD Studio could make a more fully realised vision.",,,,,,,,"Bright Memory: Infinite feels like a tech demo someone made just to prove they could do it.

Maybe too short.",,,"Bright Memory: Infinite is a shining example of the power of development tools when placed in the hands of someone who truly knows how to get the most out of them. With its AAA production values and polished gameplay, it provides an evening’s worth of action that entertained me in a way that the genre has struggled to do since Respawn’s underappreciated Titanfall 2.

It poses some questionable gameplay changes, some good, some bad, but it still presents itself as a dash of fresh air with great modes like Portal and Hazard Zone.

It’s fun, frantic, and as engrossing as Battlefield has ever been. While the launch has been filled with a myriad of technical issues that I failed to mention in this review, those are sure to be ironed out over the next few months. The main issues I have with 2042 are some of its inherent design decisions. The majority of maps are too large to be impactful, the Specialist system has taken away a core aspect of what makes Battlefield work as a franchise, and the tone of the game is often at odds with itself.

astria-ascending,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Astria Ascending has the makings of a great game, but it falls short on several fronts. A version of the game that started out at an earlier point in the story, in order to gradually introduce each character and their abilities, would have helped smooth the transition into the main quest. A number of QoL improvements, especially related to the speed of the battles, would also drastically improve the gameplay. As it stands, Astria Ascending feels like a throwback to a different era, while needlessly ignoring the modern conveniences that have improved the genre in the time that has passed since then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Astria Ascending is a gorgeous, very ambitious and at the same time flawed experience. It has deep mechanics, but their implementation could have used some more attention. The graphics are as gorgeous as some tracks are memorable, but sometimes they are out of sync. The background story is rich, yet the game fails to use it, making you do to the very same actions in different locations. If you like old school JRPGs you will overlook the shortcomings and have a good time with the game. If you never had a soft spot for the game best represented by Final Fantasy, Astria Ascending will not make you fall in love with the genre.",,,,,"Astria Ascending is a beautifully hand-drawn game with an old school JRPG feel. It tries to keep the experience modern with some much needed quality of life improvements, but annoying bugs hold it back. It’s a bit of a shame that the story is fairly forgettable but the fun combat system does help alleviate this to an extent. With a very detailed job system and plenty of optional side content to get involved with, there is entertainment to be found here if don’t mind the grind — but as an overall role-playing adventure, Astria Ascending has clear flaws.",,,,,"Thanks to the beauty of its graphics and music, Astria Ascending has an undeniable charm. Far from being content to be a beautiful postcard, the title does not forget to offer solid RPG mechanics to offer a tough challenge to fans of the genre.

Nonetheless, it remains a nice title which, behind its flaws, has an atmosphere that will delight those nostalgic for old-fashioned J-RPGs.",,,"Astria Ascending will take many gamers back to the heyday of classic RPGs. This is a single-player turn-based game that is easy to grasp, with perhaps not enough challenge for veterans of the genre. But with an entertaining story, great musical score, and pleasing art style, there is plenty of enjoyment to be had for any RPG fan. Play Astria Ascending when you want to be completely absorbed into a game with no strings (or services) attached.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For a game with so many valid criticisms, a recommendation might not seem forthcoming, but Astria Ascending rises above all of these issues as a total experience, with the art alone making worth the price of admission. The character customization gives a feeling of constant, incremental progress that fulfills the effort put in. There’s always a new skill to learn, a new strategy to try. It would have been nice if the story was better and if the dungeon exploration was less frustrating, but this is a game that’s well worth the time for any fan of JRPGs, especially since it’s being sold at a lower price than most new titles. So long as the player knows what they’re getting into, then there’s too much superlative stuff in this package to ignore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"When it comes down to it, Astria Ascending is a charming blend of new and old, and a very enjoyable RPG experience overall.

I would hesitate to label it a good one. In a year of winners, it's not a complete outlier but it's no contemporary classic. Despite a few flirtations with intrigue, the story is generally vacant of anything compelling enough to stick around until the credits. Poor writing compounds the problem and unlikable characters can't overcome it. Gameplay ranges from strong to stale, with just enough gumption and innovation to keep things lively.

However, their proposal is limited and it may be that after a while there will not be too many incentives to stay in the game. I would have liked to see more synergies between the skills of drivers and cars, I think the team component loses a bit of meaning within the framework of a game like this.

[Impressions]",,,,,"This is an interesting approach to multiplayer combat games, although a bit flawed. The main issues? The arenas are too big, the matches too long and the story mode is just a bunch of challenges you need to buy.",,"The car combat genre has long been out of fashion and still has a way to go if it wants to take us back to its glory days of the 1990s. Destruction AllStars is a mostly satisfying modernisation that has some neat ideas and looks fantastic, though ultimately spins its tyres on repetitive rival-wrecking gameplay and a lack of truly worthwhile content at launch.",,,,"Destruction AllStars delivers delightful carnage and non-stop mayhem, but issues with progression, monetization, and some poorly designed modes hold it back. Hopefully, Lucid Games and Sony will continue to build on this excellent foundation, because Destruction AllStars has the potential to be a special game with a little bit of work.",,"For now, the biggest selling point of Destruction AllStars is the fact that it's included in the PS Plus: at 80 euros we certainly wouldn't have recommended it.","Big doubts remain about the durability of the product: in terms of content, Destruction AllStars did not seem ready to sustain the attention of the average player for more than a handful of hours, and despite its undoubted qualities it could easily end up in oblivion well before the arrival of any additions and corrective noteworthy. To this we must unfortunately also add the total impossibility of playing with friends in the individual modes, undoubtedly among the most effective of the package. A limitation that, in a game like this, could prove to be particularly disabling in the long run.",,,,"If Destruction AllStars was entirely focused on the driving and crashing aspects, this review would be a hands-down recommendation. I just wish it didn’t come to a complete stop as often as it does when you lose control of the car. It does interesting things with the DualSense’s adaptive triggers and has a satisfying loop but comes to a screeching halt in other areas. Lucid Games has promised at least a year of new content for the game following its release, so hopefully, things will be fixed over time. Waiting for a fix, however, isn’t how I like to enjoy games. Luckily, Destruction AllStars is one of the free PS+ games for February, so with an online subscription and a PS5, I would recommend downloading it to give it a spin.",,"Destruction AllStars is a fun multiplayer game, but the lack of content and some questionable monetization decisions prevent us from recommending it, especially if we consider that it is a full-priced game. On the other hand, as a free PS Plus game it makes perfect sense, and we hope that Sony makes it a permanent addition to the PS Plus Collection.",,"Imagine a future where Volvo found a way to make car crashes absolutely harmless to humans and, consequently, built gigantic arenas where 16 cars were pitted against each other, looking for the most aggressive and skillful driver. Destruction AllStars is the latest trend on PS5, not because of the representation of this fantasy, but rather because it's accessible and fun. I don't know how long it will last without increasing the cooperative options or if it will be able to survive outside Plus offers. What I do know is that it needs a lot more to become entrenched in the habits of Sony players. When that happens, yes, they'll be able to dream of living and prospering from cosmetic microtransactions.",,,"Destruction AllStars can provide fun bursts of frantic car combat action, but never adds up to much more than that.",,,,,,Scratch the surface and you’ll find a very shallow car combat game that simply doesn’t have what it needs to pull you back in over and over again.

The scope could also be more generous in general: If you deduct Stockpile, which is currently too haphazardly for me, only three modes remain in very similar arenas; The character skills and special attacks of the hero cars are too interchangeable for me. Ultimately, however, I'm curious to see where the journey with Destruction AllStars is going - both in terms of new content and the question of whether it might become a full-price title at the beginning of April.",,,,,"Destruction AllStars is undoubtedly fun and has a very original concept, but its lack of content represents the biggest flaw of the combat racing developed by Lucid Games.","Destruction AllStars has many strong points to offer. Mainstream and approachable, the directing is quite good and the gameplay quick to learn — although it takes time to be truly mastered. We had a lot of fun throwing out violent bumper blows and jumping on platforms to change vehicles, as well as unleashing the powers of the many heroes available. However, it's hard to predict whether it will be successful in the long run, and the PS5's exclusivity and high purchase price may prevent it from reaching a large audience.","I had a good time behind the wheel in Destruction AllStars, even if I don’t know that it has enough to keep me around forever. That’s not to say there isn’t anything to do; there is a decent-enough selection of modes and activities between online and offline, with more on the way. And I appreciate the instantly satisfying action that’s as easy to drop in and out of as the cars themselves. Even if the novelty of vehicular mayhem isn’t enough to sustain my interest for many more long-haul sessions, I’m looking forward to taking it for a quick spin every now and again.",,,,"Destruction AllStars is, above all, fun and enjoyable mayhem, supported by a very polished technical aspect and an undeniably cool stylistic approach. The choice to launch it as part of the Plus Collection will certainly give it a huge boost in terms of playerbase – certainly more than its 80,99€ launch price would have attracted otherwise – but, as usual, these kinds of games are a matter of endurance. And for how long Destruction AllStars manages to keep its audience engaged remains to be seen.",,,,,,,,"Some fun but no content, Destruction AllStars is typical of those games getting a precocious release, and who deserve to be played again later on.

I love the pageantry when a match starts and my character does their intro before kicking things off. The visuals are smooth and pristine throughout the fast-paced action and the gameplay in different modes is absolutely delightful. I would like the foot game to be boosted a bit, and it desperately needs some better cosmetics and an easy-access Mute All function, but there’s an absolutely enthralling foundation here in Destruction AllStars. I want to see more characters, more arenas, events… I want to see where Destruction AllStars goes in the long run and I’ll be happy to keep playing as we work our way there.","With slick and satisfying gameplay wrapped in a visually stunning package, AllStars has an almost limitless potential that will only go unrealised if a few irritating roadblocks stay unmoved.","The on-foot gameplay plays a large role in Destruction AllStars' true problem: It feels like there's a lot of downtime. Even though there's always a new car to find or an enemy to chase, there's only one thing that's really worth doing--crashing--which takes a lot of setup for a short-lived reward. Even with great looks and solid controls, you spend too much time spinning your wheels.",,,,"Destruction AllStars is a fun game to watch and play. However, the slow pace of progress and lack of tangible goals limit the motivation to continue playing. The funneling towards microtransactions for progress and paywalled single-player content is frustrating. That's not to mention balance between AllStars is sorely in need of work. The good news is all of these issues can be fixed. The bones of a really great online game are here.","Destruction AllStars can be an enjoyable Twisted Metal-like experience for those nostalgic for that, but once you feel the frustration of the crashing mechanic and realize there isn’t much to work towards, you’ll probably turn around and use that nitrous in the opposite direction.",,"Destruction AllStars has a sturdy engine, but it’s overworked in almost every respect. The needless on-foot component and character abilities clutter an otherwise light but fun pick-up-and-play game with satisfying wrecks. Toss in some overeager DualSense support, and the result is a multiplayer game that’s chaotic for all the wrong reasons.",,,,,,,"Destruction AllStars certainly has its charm. It exudes personality, thanks to a varied cast of characters that - despite having zero story - seem to have something about them that makes you want to learn more about them, such as their name. You’re here for the cars, and they are fun. The smashing, or destruction, of other cars, is a genuinely fun experience that's made all the better by each character having their own ability to mix things up. The game modes do keep things ticking over, though It needs to be said that the game needs to add more in the future to keep things fresh. This isn't a bad start for Destruction AllStars, but it's also one that needs to focus on the strengths and drop the weaknesses - particularly the abysmal on-foot gameplay - to make this game the online draw it could be.",,,"Shallow, but also attractive and a lot of fun.

Playing through it again in 2021 has been enjoyable enough though and its old-school level design is actually pretty refreshing in this era of open-world titles. It's just a shame that the PS5 facelift and new DLC didn't add anything to the experience but if you want a reason to replay the game, this is it.",,,,,"No less janky or unambitious than its 2019 incarnation, Terminator: Resistance Enhanced offers up a mildly polished up experience that is augmented by some initially promising, but ultimately disappointing DLC.

You’ll no doubt have a more enjoyable time, too. It’s those who have yet to dive into what is perhaps one of the best Terminator games of all time that will get the most out of this enhanced edition, though they should still temper their expectations.

saints-row,,,,"We could have coped with technical issues, curious UI choices and unsophisticated mission design had Saints Row given us even half as many memorable moments as previous entries ""The Third"" and ""IV"". We could even forgive a Portal joke that would have felt old hat a decade ago. But this whole enterprise feels misbegotten, even before the story goes wildly off the rails, belatedly introducing a new threat, before wrapping up with an ending that almost feels algorithmically generated. [Issue#376, p.100]",,,"Volition's name has always been tied with destructible environments, and Saints Row's reboot is no different. Unfortunately, that's not the only familiar thing as the level design, combat and gameplay mechanics are all mostly the same as almost 15 years ago.","It was always going to be a difficult task but Saints Row feels like a game that doesn't really need to be. Even if the technical issues weren't a factor, what remains is an okay but fairly forgettable criminal escapade. The new characters felt like a party I wasn't invited to and whatever confidence the old games had has been sanded away. It's not awful but there was a massive sense of disappointment I could never shake through my playthrough. I wish this was better.",,,,,"Saints Row is a necessary reboot for a series that was getting out of hand (pleasingly so, but still), and Volition has made smart decisions in retooling the origins of the purple-clad gang without losing that silly, violent, and crude spirit. It leaves room for future improvement and escalation, and that’s an exciting place to put the Saints in.","Saints Row offers a fantastic sandbox full of opportunity and some great new gameplay additions, but its story and characters feel underutilized and neglected, making for a rather unmemorable experience.",,,,"Saints Row arrives as a new starting point for the franchise, but the final version makes us miss what the saga once was. Its problems goes beyond an open world that did not evolve the structure of the genre a decade ago.","Combining the realistic settings from the series’ earlier titles with the over-the-top style of entries that came after Saints Row: The Third, this is an excellent reboot. That being said, a lack of polish in the gameplay department and low quality localization for Japan cannot be ignored.",,"This installment of Saints Row delivers on the fun factor, but it's not quite the groundbreaking change what the fans of the franchise might expect, so we'll see what happens in the next chapter. An entertaining way to kill time while great open world proposals like Zelda: Breath of The Wild 2 or GTA VI itself arrive.",,,,,"My Saints Row experience was enjoyable and more than occasionally frustrating: at times it feels like Volition is on the cusp of a breakthrough in both social commentary and open-world game mechanics, while at other times it feels like it's upholding the status quo. I love the new cast of characters and what they represent to marginalized community members who will play this game, and the story is compelling enough that I persevered in the face of some irritating bugs. There's a solid game here, and plenty of fun to be had with the new Saints Row, but I find myself wishing the team had taken the concept and ran with it to the bank - before robbing said bank, of course.",,,,"It’s a below average open world game that’s stuffed to bursting with bugs, and the best thing we can say about it is that making our Tobias Fünke-inspired character crouch over and do the wanker gesture while he walked down the street made us laugh. Probably not quite worth the price of admission.",,"The feisty, distinct series was transformed into another run-of-the-mill sandbox game. New Saints Row is painfully unremarkable. The gameplay is pretty fun but repetitive and formulaic. The city – large but bland. The chaos – still present but kept on a short leash. As to the new characters, Volition must have recruited this grotesque, random gang in front of a Starbucks. What’s more, the AI is terrible and the whole game desperately needs patches.",,,,"Saints Row had chance to be something much more, if only the team behind the game tried to take a more bold and careful approach.",,,"If you find yourself in the right frame of mind, the unhinged nature of Saints Row can be cathartic, particularly if you find yourself in a good series of missions where the writing and humour aren’t too manic, and the action isn't too humdrum. In the end, Saints Row succeeds in recalling and refreshing the affable personality of the dormant series, but this reboot is simply a return, not an evolution.","While much of this review may seem negative, there’s a lot to like about Saints Row. Its cast quickly grows on you, it has some entertaining set-pieces, and there’s explosive fun around every corner. Customisation is also a high-point: if you like creating zany characters, you’ll be in your element. But while in many ways this this the best Saints Row game to date, there are also multiple design decisions that pull it down. For a game all about building a crime syndicate, the fact that engaging in such activities feels so optional on the main path is a crime itself. It also won’t come as much surprise to Saints Row fans that this is just as scrappy as ever before. Still, it’s ridiculously enjoyable nonetheless.","Volition’s gamble to reset and reground Saints Row pays off generously. A visual delight, with plenty of gameplay mechanics to keep players goofing off for days, and the Santo Ileso setting is one of the best in video game history. Sure, the shooting gets redundant after a while, but with so much to see and do you can go hours in between gun battles. Saints Row manages retain what players loved while feeling fresh and new. Other reboots, take note – this is how you do it.",,"You could consider Saints Row a love letter to a time when games worried less over quality and more about fun, but that doesn't excuse its faults.",,"The reboot of Saints Row is failing both as a reboot as well as a good game due to the game running poorly, a sandbox riddled with bugs and a boring story with just a few fun characters. Blowing stuff up is good and all, but Santo Ileso simply isn't a fun place to create chaos in. Driving the expensive cars is simply the best part, but steering clear of Saints Row at launch is by far the best way to go.","Although Saints Row may fall short in some technical aspects, it is still incredibly fun. We enjoyed character customization, controls and some mission design.",,"Saints Row still doesn't understand that the video game industry has changed since its last installment and must remodel its structure from scratch. While the narrative and jokes are good and moderately coherent within the madness of the game, the mechanical basis of this does not help at all when it comes to creating a competent title and above all, remarkable or outstanding.","Saints Row consist of both good and bad parts, but the bad parts leave more of an impression on the player. It's a shame that while there is some genuine fun to be had with the game, it still doesn't live up to even the worst of what the original series had to offer.","In many ways, Saints Row is a game that looks back on its past with reverence, trying to keep much of what worked in the past while updating it for a new generation of players (and consoles). It manages to do it with many more hits than mistakes, but it's still a game that shouldn't please any player. If you are a fan of its tone and proposal, it is undeniable that there are dozens of hours of fun here.",,,,,,,"Drawing on an arsenal of side missions that were already repetitive in 2013, this title is ideal for those who wanted that old GTA experience, but not for those looking for something next gen.

Saints Row is effective, but generic"".",,,"Even in the reboot, Saints Row offers wacky fun at times, but gets in its own way with grind and repetitive tasks.",,"The new Saints Row is a breath of fresh air for a franchise that really needed it. After long years of idleness, it comes back with a banger. Yes, it will be compared to GTA V. Yes, it won't please some people that thought it would/should be straight like the first entry of the series. And, as almost every open-world game, it experiences some technical difficulties. But once you play it, you'll probably enjoy it. Loads of missions, excellent customization options, great level design. Saints Row is fun again, and that's everything we could ask for.","As is, it’s hard to recommend spending $80 on this quirky but erratic crime saga. There’s fun to be had, but best wait for Saints Row to make its way to your subscription service — and maybe receive a few much needed patches in the process.","Saints Row raises mixed emotions: on the one hand it has its moments when it is fun and manages to engage you in its criminal empire building fantasy. But for each high you have at least one low, that turns the game into a technical mess and makes you feel like you are playing a not so pretty GTA clone. The new direction, both visually and gameplay wise show a lot of promise, but the execution is severely lacking. With the so necessary bug fixes and some quality-of-live improvements, the new Saints Row can be a nice experience that won't innovate upon the formula, but at least it will offer fun moments.","Saints Row had a unique opportunity to come back and be a good summer game. Most of the time, its fun, especially in co-op, thanks to his arcade feel and humour But there are too many flaws and way too many bugs to enjoy the title completely. Maybe some updates could fix things but not entirely.","Saints Row left me wanting more. Even the radio stations you can listen to and the track selection felt small in comparison to how bombastic of a soundtrack its past games had. While its side missions checked the open-world box of giving you something to do to keep you busy during or after you finish the story, most of them felt repetitive and only some truly captured the fun the games are known for thanks to some clever writing and line delivery.",,,"Saints Row is a largely successful reboot, even if it sometimes feels dangerously outdated in terms of open world design. Its story and characters can be hit and miss, but the experience is carried by fun gameplay and an endearingly dumb sense of humour. Despite the new faces, Saints Row is definitely still Saints Row — just bigger and probably better.","Saints Row is a game that becomes quite fun. It's full of great humor and some entertaining action sequences. Unfortunately, its open world can fall into monotony due to the repetition of its secondary activities.","Saints Row rebooted itself and lost much more of its charm than it’d care to admit. The new heroes aren’t likeable, they aren’t funny, and the whole game feels stuck in the previous decade. And it’s full of technical problems, too.",,"A tragically outdated open world adventure that almost has more in common with Goat Simulator than Grand Theft Auto, despite some moderately entertaining mechanics.","Saints Row is not really what we can call a total reboot of the saga, but rather a soft-reboot: it is very similar to Saints Row The Third which, even if appreciated, is nonetheless ten years old. In fact, this is felt and this new adventure is still struggling to impose itself through its technique, its gameplay or its creativity which remain anchored in a certain immobility despite some novelties: it is however a game of effective action that never takes itself seriously, rather funny and with damn generous content, which we can never blame him for. Volition finally delivers Saints Row 3 with far-west sauce, which remains appreciable without breaking three pieces of dough for a gunslinger.","The problem with the new Saints Row is not just that the characters are boring, or that the combat is by-the-numbers and benumbed by unempowering perks, but that the brief snatches of fun—the wingsuit deployed from a high rise, the hand-brake turn through a curtain of tyre smoke—are nothing new, and are done better in other games.","It’s been nine years since Saints Row 4, and this new entry feels like a back-to-basics reboot. But technical issues, bugs, and many more little frustrations conspire to make this a middling experience at launch. It’s unfortunate because when Saints Row fires on all cylinders, it’s an absolute blast with some truly lofty high points.","Saints Row is the game to play when you want to turn your brain off and enjoy some mayhem. With many criminal ventures to run through, there is always something to do, some other bar to progress as you help the Saints reach their true potential. It’s a shame a few technical issues show up, but thankfully most of these can be overcome by restarting the game. This may not be as over-the-top as previous Saints Row games, but it could be the start of something great.","Saints Row is everything you’d expect from a new entry into the franchise: It’s full of larger-than-life story beats, a LARPing subplot, oodles of customization, and outlandish Skills to take down your enemies with. While it doesn’t reinvent the wheel by any means, your Boss and their three companions are where this reboot truly shines — and it’s a joy to experience Santo Ileso and all that it has to offer with them.","The Saints Row reboot attempts to reimagine the Saints' origins by transplanting them to a new, beautiful city. The problem is that the characters are uninteresting, the gameplay lacks originality or polish and technically the game sometimes shows debilitating bugs.","With minor swabs the Saints Row reboot maintains the madness of the series, delivering entertaining, effectfull action and humorous cutscenes and dialogue with a myriad pop cultural references. It is still not on eye level with GTA, but especially concerning customization of characters, cars or weapons, Saints Row sets a new standard for the genre.",,"Saints Row could have been the reboot of renewal or that of consecration, but it will ultimately be that of semi-disappointment. Open world too classic, band of anti-heroes without real charisma, questionable artistic direction and lot of glitches spoil the gaming experience.","Torn between two identities, Saints Row is a misjudged attempt at reinventing the series, instead ushering in a lack of mission variety and a tired narrative that fails to light up what could have been a genuine competitor in the absence of a new Grand Theft Auto. Those even looking for mindless fun will struggle to find anything here, even if Criminal Ventures and co-op play offer glimpses at what could have been. Back to the drawing board.","he character creator still shines, but frustrating mission design and a disappointing plot make this reboot difficult to recommend. Far more sinner than saint. [Issue#19, p.92]",,,"I can't help but admit I'm having a smashing time - quite literally - with Saints Row. Yes, the story is trite at times and yes, much of where that story takes you can feel a touch ridiculous, but it's to the team's credit that this deftly side-steps the issues of its predecessors and rarely feels gratuitous or malicious. The Saints Row reboot is self-aware and self-deprecating and if you're able to move past its prior reputation, there's a fast and furious shooter here that's worthy of your time.",,,,,"Technical issues notwithstanding, Saints Row is not without its shortcomings, but it succeeds more often than it doesn’t. Even with the release date pushed back it still doesn’t feel finalized. The tech issues can hopefully be ironed out in a patch or two, but the characters could have also benefitted from further development and being more fleshed out. Santa Ileso is a great open sandbox to explore, but it seems like a greater emphasis was placed on repetitive criminal venture activities and less on the more exciting story missions. Still, what Saints Row does well is it does very well with memorable missions after the Saints have started to establish themselves. The banter between characters is generally entertaining and a lot of the humor is derived from this series never taking itself too seriously. There’s a lot of potential with this reboot and new cast of characters, but it doesn’t seem like it was fully realized in this title, making it a game that’s fun for Saints Row fans, but isn’t the spectacular reboot we were hoping for.","Saints Row is ready and willing to leap back into the mainstream, though it's unfortunately weighed down by a few odd design decisions and a handful of technical issues.","This is not by any means a revolution for the franchise, but Saints Row is all about fun, and we’ve had a lot with this new entry.",,"After so many facelifts, there were fears Saints Row would fail to recapture the unconventional beauty of the earlier games, but this reboot proves how adept Volition is when it comes to reinventing their flagship franchise. This latest outing is my favourite game in the series to date, so while basic combat and dips in visual quality are disappointing, they did little to keep me away from Santo Ileso. You'll struggle to find anything ground-breaking though this sandbox is bursting with entertaining things to do, ideal for sharing with a partner in crime.",,,"The Saints have come marching in once again and while Santo Ileso offers a fun playground for these reborn renegades, it’s somewhat marred by a wealth of graphical issues, some underwhelming gunplay and a predictable narrative. Having said all that, you can customise your character into an orange, hurl yourself into traffic to make money and throw a self-propelled football at enemies to send them into space. It’s Saints Row as you remember, for better or worse, with a new coat of paint and refurbished for modern times.","The Saints Row reboot doesn't rewrite the franchise's playbook, but that doesn't detract from the fact that it is a fun-filled playground of carnage and destruction.",,,,"Saints Row is fun, but it feels like it forgot that we are in 2022 and not in 2013 anymore, 'cause it really has nothing new or fresh to offer.",,,,,,"I can understand Volition wanting to reboot the Saints Row series given the original launched all the way back in 2006. But the latest entry feels like a backwards step for the developer, with this release misses out on the over-the-top satirical humour that made the series so beloved. As a result, Saints Row now feels like a mediocre open-world action game, becoming just like all of the games at which the series used to poke fun. Mission objectives are bland and repetitive, while the story is boring and lacks cohesion. Worst of all, the slapstick jokes rarely land and are arguably more cringeworthy than they are funny. You can still have fun if you simply want mindless chaotic action, but I’d argue you’d have a better time with the likes of CyberPunk 2077 or even Saints Row The Third Remastered.","Saints Row could be something special. It really could, but Volition still doesn't know how to treat this franchise, placing it somewhere between Grand Theft Auto and Just Cause, never managing to leave its own fingerprints on the open worlds it creates. The Saints Row reboot is so similar to the original franchise in tone, gameplay and content that it leaves you wondering why it was even necessary to hit the reset button. There is fun to be had, but it's hidden behind bugs, repetitive missions and a detached story that doesn't know whether it wants to be a caricature of other plots or a candid tale about a group of friends involved in the criminal world.","There’s a lot to like and a lot to laugh at in Saints Row as you raise hell around Santo Ileso with your unique boss. Collecting clothes and cars as you scale up your network of businesses is compelling as you accumulate wealth and solidify your spot at the top. But outside of the super set-piece main missions, it’s easy to bounce off the more repetitive elements of the open-world.",,,"The new Saints Row brings you... well, more Saints Row action just a little toned down this time, which makes the inferiority to the GTA series more clearer than ever. Still, if you've been missing games of this type, it can be fun at least in short bursts.","The reboot of the series is not a bad game. In it's best moments it is goofy over the top fun. The problem is: These moments are extremely rare. Most of the time you're playing repetitive missions where you're shooting AI enemies who are incredibly stupid and the gunplay feels like straight from the year 2005. But the biggest flaw of the game is its' humour. It is funny at times, but never as hilarious as the old Saints Rows. It is a mediocre game with only flashes of what the series was beloved for ten years ago.",,,,,"Saints Row 2022 is a time capsule of a game and era many have moved past. Instead of building on the legacy of Saints Row, it feels like a tired retread of a game we already have.",,,,,"This was a necessary reboot, now Saints Row feels more realistic. It strays from the crazy and fun roots of the original. Customize every aspect of our character is awesome but unfortunately it is not a perfect game. Still is our favorite open world game about criminals and is back with more perks than before.",,,"A known series makes its comeback to the scenes with a game which is, overall, funny, engaging and explosive in its own craziness. Too bad that there are too many bugs.",,,,"Although hindered by technical issues and packed in an overly inflated map, building your criminal empire via driving and shooting your way through Santo Ileso is a molotov cocktail of fun – made more so with the wealth or perks, skills, and customisation options at your disposal. Be that as it may, it’s the modern take of the Saint’s Row series’ signature writing and tone – carried through an entertaining story and its lovable characters – that shines brightest.",,,,,"What the Saints Row reboot truly reminds us is that -- whatever situation they may find themselves in -- the Saints do it for each other. 2022's Saints Row is less about reeling it in and more about coming home. And in the house that Santo Ileso's Saints built, ""damn, it feels good to be a gangster.",,,,,,,,,"Unambitious, dated, and dreadfully lacking in polish, only series fans eager for more classic Saints gameplay need apply.",,,"Ultimately, Saints Row may not be the grand return to the franchise that fans were hoping for, but that doesn't mean it's not worth giving a look. Despite a poorly-paced story with average characters, it still has a ton of content and a sandbox that is ripe for hours of co-op fun. Even if you're playing solo, building a criminal empire is empowering and elevates Saints Row beyond being yet another open-world crime game. If it didn't take some steps back or feel buggy and dated, this game would get a more glowing recommendation, but unfortunately, it doesn't hit all of its marks.",,,,,,"There’s always self-doubt involved when you savage a game like this, but Volition had a second chance – to reboot a truly barmy franchise and do whatever they want with it – but any potential here has been squandered. A combat system with no satisfaction. A world with no immersion. Missions with no imagination. It’s a shame that this is what they came up with.",,"Saints Row is a confusing game, on multiple levels. I can’t say I didn’t have fun with it—there’s a compulsive pleasure in open-world gaming that’s hard to tamp down, no matter how intent the game seems to be on keeping its players from enjoying themselves too much. (If you need a big map of stuff to checklist your way down, the game will absolutely scratch that itch.) Its tonal issues are, weirdly, a function of making its characters too likable, instead of not enough. And it desperately wants you to think you’re having fun, without ever providing concrete steps towards giving players more to do than function in a very rote loop. In hindsight, it reminds me a bit of the whiteboard that your business-buzzword-obsessed buddy Eli busts out early on, when the Saints are first figuring out how to turn themselves into a functional gang: Some big, flashy concepts; very few ideas on how to execute.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Saints Row’s dynamic mission design and chaotic vehicular gameplay do wonders for an otherwise mundane open world experience, one that is sorely missing the iconic characters who brought the previous games to life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A really, really fun experience that is getting sh*t on for no reason other than groupthink, herd mentality and people on the bandwagon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
godfall,,"I cannot recommend this game at full price. Again, as part of a free subscription it might be worth checking out and getting a few hours of slashy combat in. But I wouldn’t touch it unless the $70 asking price comes down by at least half, and even then, there are a half dozen other better games out this fall alone. I wanted to like Godfall. I never want to see games in this genre fail. But fail it does, and in a worse way than anything I have seen in a long while.",,,"After wrapping Godfall, I was left with the feeling that it’s going to be a one-and-done. I can’t see myself doing its endless trials or repeating the endgame boss fights — it just doesn’t feel like there’s anything more to work towards. The graphics are great and the combat is enjoyable, but it gets samey too quickly and ends up as a typical next-generation launch game that will be soon forgotten.","Godfall is a game that features nervous gameplay and an extremely satisfying progression system. It is also sumptuous. Nevertheless, it does not cover much ground and it quickly becomes a repetitive game. In addition, it has technical problems namely frequent falls of framerates which considerably spoil the experience. Too bad!",,,,,,,"Godfall has all the ingredients for an enjoyable epic game, but somehow these ingredients are assembled into a soulless Franken-game that feels empty and soulless. While the combat is solid, and some of the boss fights are clever, players will still be left wondering why they should continue playing.

However is inferior to other similar proposals that now offer something similar in free to play format.,,"With a good & really fun to play combat system, and some lusty, shiny New Gen visuals, Godfall is a game that shines in its first few hours. But then you begin to notice its flaws, and everything is pretty much the same, one mission after another in a story that it’s just a few lines on a paper. There’s a lot of content in the Loot & Equipment department, things to farming, astonishing armours to build, but few Final Bosses, few types of weapons and poor missions design -except those that mimic the Monster Hunter type and the great 3 players Coop, the best of all indeed. It’s a hit-and-miss of a game, but if you like to fight & loot & fight & loot, it can really hook on you.",,,,,"Like other looter-style games, Godfall could become a much more appealing prospect in time. Godfall's $70 price tag works against it big time because as it stands, it's difficult to recommend such an expensive game to anyone when it recycles the same content repeatedly throughout the entire experience. Godfall's core combat mechanics are great and it's a visually-impressive experience, but gamers may want to wait and see if the game gets some compelling post-launch content updates first.",,"Godfall is the quintessential launch game. This gilded PS5 exclusive shows off the power of the new hardware with its intricate, reflective halls of gold and obsidian, bioluminescent plant life, and enemies who explode in a shower of particles. “Next-gen is here,” it shouts, in a scream that’s barely perceptible over the whistle of high-speed steel. Underneath all of that sheen and noise, though, there’s nothing new at all.","An enjoyable hack and slash looter that plays well despite a sparse, repeating structure.",,,,,A plotline incapable of generating interest in the player that ends up being as bland as it is dispensable.,"The only thing Godfall has going for it is its great combat system. Everything else just came along for the ride. [01/2021, p.42]",,"Godfall is going to go down as one of the most divisive games of this generation's launch: a relic to some, a wild whispered-about gem to others.","The core combat system is satisfying and would shine if the game had more unique content to push the player forward. As it is, there’s very little hook and most players will likely find themselves getting bored around the halfway mark.","In the end Godfall feels like a tech demo with a questionable battle system, mandatory grind, boring locations and uninspiring plot. And as a cherry on top you can expect plenty of bugs and glitches. You can try this game, sure, but only if you don't have anything better to play, and only after some much needed updates and bug-fixes.","Despite its incredible art design and fluid combat, Godfall is simply too shallow to make a lasting impression.",,,,,,"Godfall is a massive surprise. It borrows combat from God of War and has enough loot to make Diablo blush. It may look garish but it's well designed and has that ""one more go"" factor.",,"Godfall is a pretty game but features stale gameplay that just gets repetitive after a while. It lacks depth and fun loot to collect. The concept of the looter/slasher isn't bad, just not fleshed out enough.",Quotation forthcoming.,"While Godfall’s technical components of gameplay and graphics were solid, the game overall is just fine. As mentioned, the narrative as told throughout is relatively shallow, and despite a fun combat system, it does get repetitive. Finally, the recurrence of a number of bugs hampered my personal experience, and these do not appear to be an isolated case. While I quite enjoyed Godfall at the outset, it began to wane on me over time, and what might have been a decent launch title may not seem like it years from now.",,,,,,,"Graphically, Godfall is an absolute triumph while also delivering fun pickup and play combat that will appeal to a more casual crowd. With up to three in multiplayer, or a very viable solo implementation, the game is a fun but repetitive romp through a faux-Arthurian world. While there are some technical hurdles to patch, there’s a lot of fun to be had here. Now let’s just hope we get to someday see the rest!","At the end of the day, Godfall is a game with a dull story, boring world, uninteresting loot, and simplistic combat, but it looks pretty and feels nice to play. It's not a bad game for a quick playthrough, but it's not something that is going to keep your attention for very long, despite theoretically being designed for loot-grinding fun. Considering the new game price of $70, it's difficult to recommend Godfall, even if you're very hungry for a new game for your PS5. Once it comes down in price, it'll be easier to justify picking it up for a mindless hack-and-slash weekend, but at the moment, it doesn't do enough to really be worthwhile.",,,"Godfall is often great in its moment to moment gameplay, though fails to ever make anything of its story. It's a fun time, but never feels like it reaches its full potential.",,,,,"It grows repetitive, but the dodging, blocking, parrying, slashing combat — while a bit overly complicated at times — should prove challenging and gratifying enough to keep fans of this sort of game moving forward.

However, in reality, that's the only thing it has to boast about. An inconsequential loot system, recycled environments, and a frustrating mission structure thwart any sort of enjoyment the game might offer. It's not god-awful, but Godfall is going to be very quickly forgotten about.",,"Godfall is such an average game. It doesn’t stand out in terms of visuals nor in terms of the combat system.

Instead we are given a confusing story that doesn’t fit the equipment and realms that really don’t care which suit you are wearing. While the weapons and armor gave the game a serious chance at success, I’m afraid the storyline and repetitive gameplay will doom this game to the bargain bin. It is beautiful, though, and that is its greatest achievement as a launch day PS5 title.",,"Godfall is visually pleasing, with a responsive gameplay and a nice level of challenge. Unfortunately, the narrative is mediocre and the game system appears almost entirely devoid of temper, which makes the game a little more than an adequate forerunner for the new gaming generation.",,"Godfall is such an unpleasant experience it's difficult for me to find anything to like. Occasionally, it flirts with just being a mediocre snooze, but then you hit an aggravating boss fight that reminds you of how poorly it was designed. It would take an entire shift in tone and genre to salvage anything offered.","Even if it's the first game announced on PS5, Godfall is far from a system seller. Sure, the graphics are appealling, but most of what's left after is pretty disappointing, from the poor story to the repetitive gameplay.

That said, it’s hard to ignore the flimsy scaffolding that keeps this PS5 launch title standing, the lack of matchmaking, and a loot system you’ll quickly lose interest in. Although still great fun in short bursts, this isn’t the rousing next-gen RPG experience you’ve been searching for.",,,,,,Godfall is a fun looter shooter but it has too many flaws and lacks consistency and coherence to go beyond sufficiency.,"Godfall is an immature title, unbalanced in many of its constituent components, evidently built to take advantage of the launch of PlayStation 5 with a bit of cunning. A game with many defects, but also with a satisfying and delightfully hilarious combat system, capable thanks to its enviable substance of supporting - together with the theatrical, exorbitant, opulent technical realization - the entire hut.","Godfall is a derivative action title with a repetitive game structures and bad loot balancing.

Stunning visuals give Godfall a leg up against the competition, whereas mostly well executed yet uninspired design decisions mean the rest of the game doesn’t live up to its potential. The negatives don’t outweigh the positives, but there are enough design errors to ultimately cause Godfall to blend in with the crowd. As I already mentioned, Godfall is not a Game as a Service, so we won’t be seeing the continual updates and upgrades that games like Destiny 2 or The Division 2 have received. Hopefully that doesn't mean Counterplay is finished with Godfall because it would only take a few tweaks here and there for it to complete it's ascension to gaming godhood.",,,,,,,,,,"Godfall’s sluggish, overly complicated combat, hilariously paper-thin story, and numerous technical issues make it a lowlight of the PlayStation 5’s launch lineup.","Repetitive, screamingly colorful and as shallow as a baby pool.

It does not matter that the game severely lacks variety and a decent story, when we get new flashy graphics.

Actions fans might still find plenty to like here, but wait for a sale.",,,,,"Loot-focused titles like Destiny and The Division grew stronger over time, as their developers added content and fresh gameplay mechanics. It’s difficult seeing the same happening to Godfall. There simply isn’t enough meat to provide a solid foundation for future updates and enhancements.

This is what makes it so frustrating. There is definite potential for a gem inside this game, but it’s so busy with being a downright average-at-best looter that it loses all semblance of actual personality, a key component to maintaining a looter game. Impressively non-existent story, incredibly derivative art, classes which mean absolutely nothing, a deceptively small loot pool, technical issues up the wazoo, terrible endgame design and a horrific netcode all add up to a visually pleasing but soulless affair that can’t even begin to escape being categorised as anything more than a flashy tech demo.",,"For a first outing, Counterplay has achieved something that's undeniably striking in the visuals department, though that's marred by sameiness and the odd, isolated framerate hitch.

Granted there’s some fun to be had but once the next-generation glitz wears off what’s left is a repetitive slog through levels that quickly get old.",,"The combat feels great and this sort of game can be a real treat with friends. That’s a place where the game’s completely uninteresting story doesn’t really matter and where the repetition becomes more expected. Even then though, the game’s mission structure remains incredibly basic and the style while not completely unappealing certainly isn’t interesting. Fighting your way through these levels feels really good, but that can only sustain a game for so long, especially with this many issues. A certain type of player who really enjoys a good loot game and doesn’t care a bit about repetition will love Godfall but for everyone else, there are much better ways to break in your new video game system.","While a bit muddled in combat design and pretty dull in world design, Godfall is a passable 3D action game.

There is no shortage of reasons to be excited about the future of the studio.",,,,,"Wearing its inspiration on its sleeve, Dolmen is a clear attempt at bringing the Souls-like to a sci-fi setting. However, the experience is hurt thanks to shoddy execution in almost all aspects. Featuring a non-committal narrative, poorly paced difficulty, and a general lack of polish in both single and multiplayer modes. Dolmen is difficult to recommend, especially when considering the competition out there, whether that be from more capable clones or From Software. We can only hope that the rare, good aspects are carried over into more proficient titles which are no doubt coming in the future.",,,,,"Dolmen attempts to add some potentially good ideas into the Soulsborne formula.

At first, most enemies can be seen from a distance, but they quickly begin to hide around corners, on the ceiling, or within the environment. A few jumpscares will lead to cautiously approaching every turn and inspecting all of the walls. Horror mixed with features like an intricate upgrade system, daunting combat encounters, and the ability to take on difficult bosses alongside some friends makes Dolmen an exciting title that delivers constant action and intense challenges.",,,,,,,,,,,,"As far as sci-fi Souls-likes go, Dolmen sits somewhere between Hellpoint and The Surge in terms of quality. It can offer a rewarding experience to Souls-like fans, but it falls short of the bar set by the creators of the genre.

Unfortunately, it botches just about every aspect of being a Souls-like game. There were many concerns that I could look past in the demo, but are inexcusable in a full release.

The combat system has been beefed up, but variety is still in short-supply and the same environments being used throughout dungeons hurts things. The overworld exploration is the most pure fun the game offers up in its current form and it’s a shame some streamlining wasn’t done to dungeons to make them less laborious and more fun to complete.",,,,"Dusk Diver 2 flies too close to the sun - and it isn't even aiming for the sun in it's own solar system. While the original game was a tight and exciting brawler, this sequel tries to pivot into a more methodical character-action style without the tools that make those games so rewarding. The result is a game with repetitive, sluggish combat dominating the entire experience.

However, those who simply want some old-school action in a roguelike setup will surely appreciate what it has to offer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The unpredictability of stages definitely gives Curved Space a unique feel for a shoot-’em-up. However, the novelty wears off when you realise it also often means having to navigate these bizarre layouts in search of any specific or leftover targets. The way objectives evolve constantly should be an asset, yet it ends up being a hindrance and slows the pace.

rustler,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While Rustler manages to live up to everything it says on the tin, namely Grand Theft Auto with horses, there’s not much in its delivery that leaves any sort of memorable experience. Relying almost entirely on its humour, Rustler tries to steal your fancy with crass jokes and pop culture references. However, it never quite manages to stand out as anything more than a basic sandbox romp, with all the repetitive fetch quests in tow. Couple that with some lacklustre mechanics, and what you’ve got is a fairly disappointing GTA clone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rustler is not quite the retro callback to early sandbox games that players may have hoped for. It's an enjoyable fun diversion for a little sharp burst of low brow humor, but in the long term it's unlikely to keep players engaged. Combined with a wide variety of technical issues, Rustler feels like something of a missed opportunity.",,,,,,,,,,,,"‘Disappointing’ is the best word to describe Rustler. It takes the original Grand Theft Auto template, plops it within a medieval world, then delivers ho-hum missions. Add to that an overall lack of polish, some mechanics that don’t entertain quite like they should, and the absence of voice acting, and you have a small open world adventure that never quite delivers on its promise. Still, chances are you’ll get some fun out of it if you pick it up. Just perhaps not as much as its introductory FMV would suggest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rustler can be a fun enough game if you're willing to forgive some of its flaws. The missions may not be that different from other genre titles, but seeing it all play out from a top-down viewpoint can trigger nostalgia for those who have dabbled in the older titles. The humor is subjective enough, and the overall length feels just right, but some can attribute this to bugs and design decisions that may feel archaic nowadays. Rustler may not be for everyone, but it's good enough for those who aren't too fussy about their games.",,,,,,,,,"Overall, Rustler is a success story, a light-hearted and satirical game that does not take itself seriously at all. It tries to be an homage for both the classic GTA games but also to the comedy of Monty Python. It is a bit rough around the edges, sometimes it drowns you in Monty Python references and it could have used some more polishing, but it’s a fun experience. You have no real replay value here, but Rustler will keep you entertained for a weekend or two.",,,,,"DualSense support is included to reflect your stamina through the adaptive triggers. Unfortunately, despite the generally simplistic presentation, performance is worryingly inconsistent on PS5, which is a shame. All in all, though, this is a fun if forgettable medieval romp: much of the appeal stems from seeing how GTA series staples have been adapted, like the Pimp-a-Horse drive-thrus which clear your Wanted level and the end of mission beats that accompany each quest you complete.",,,,,,,,"For all of its issues, Rustler is a fun little game that tries something a bit different, recapturing a long-lost element of game design and adding a fun new twist. Its humorous and satirical elements help keep it light-hearted, and though it occasionally has some comedic misses, its also full of genuinely laugh-out-loud moments. I’d hope to see some adjustments to the combat system as well as a general cleanup of the odd variety of bugs encountered, but as a whole Rustler is a clever and fun title that has zero shame being exactly what it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An homage to the original GTA games, Rustler is a fun medieval twist on what made those 90’s smash hit games so enjoyable.

That's what it does and that's how it goes for the player too, who cannot avoid to be captivated by the absurd medieval setting, by the old style gameplay and by mountains of elegant vulgarity.",,,"The idea of a Medieval take on the Grand Theft Auto formula is undoubtedly intriguing. That’s why it’s such a shame that Rustler falls short of realizing its full potential. From the game’s unsatisfying combat to its rinse-and-repeat missions, it doesn’t take long before the game starts to wear out its welcome. Add to that near game-breaking technical issues, and you have a title that’s pretty hard to recommend to all but the most desperate fans of the genre. Still, if you’re looking for an unapologetically old-school throwback to the GTA games of old, you might just find some fun to be had with Rustler.",,,,,,,,,"Rustler brings classic Grand Theft Auto to a twisted version of the European Middle Ages, but its reliance on other media for laughs and a finicky release build makes it a title worth trying only for those nostalgic for the vintage entries of a now-juggernaut series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The medieval Grand Theft Auto was only partially successful, while the main domain is the historical setting accompanied by plenty more or less tasteful and apt jokes. Outdated approach to game is then the biggest obstacle on the way to success.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The biggest crime in Rustler is that the game is very funny but not very fun.

clid-the-snail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Clid The Snail has been a real surprise for me. It is impossible to overlook the incredible work that Weird Beluga Studio has done, the care and dedication they have put into every aspect of the game. They have built a very beautiful and detailed world, despite the fact that we spend 90% of the time shooting and looking at enemies. The story features original characters and dialogue that will bring a smile to our faces. And the gameplay is diabolical: I haven't had this much fun shooting things since 2016's DOOM and I haven't felt so on the ropes since Dark Souls and Bloodborne.",,,,,,"It’s unfortunate that Clid the Snail is so boring to play, because it really has some interesting ingredients. Between the oddball premise and the unsettling atmosphere, there’s definitely some talent here. Ultimately though, none of that can overcome gameplay that just falls a little flat.",,,,,,,,,,"I had mixed feelings from the very first minute. On the one hand Spanish developers chose an interesting setting and an unusual protagonist but on the other hand the execution is questionable.

Its “methodical” combat often ends up more cumbersome and overwhelming than tactical. An interesting story, world, and mystery, however, helped to keep my interest despite these issues.

But I didn't have a memorable one, either. It was a nice bit of action nostalgia for a short while, but in a world where less glitzy action titles feature so much more depth, agility or even wit, Gungrave G.O.R.E. will have a tough time separating itself from all of the bullet-fare that's out there.",,,"There is some joy in the mindless blasting, but overall G.O.R.E. is a messy, repetitive experience that could have used a bit more time in the oven.",,,,,,"At the end of the day, maybe Gungrave isn’t necessarily the best game of the year, but on the other hand, it’s not the worst either.

In the game, you are simply a bad-ass and that feels good.

Potentially a very cool game, although it loses some momentum as you progress.",,"If you're someone who heard ""a new Gungrave"" and got excited, this is a game for you. For what it's worth, it nails that. It genuinely feels like a lost PS2 game, and that's the kind of thing we love.

However, we can't in good faith recommend someone to spend £45 on this, outside of those with an affinity for the series.",,,,,,,,,,,"Gungrave has an eventful and largely glorious history. G.O.R.E. is a technical retread, from which you shouldn't expect too many surprises in terms of story - as well as gameplay.

That's exactly what we came for.",,"Voluntarily old school, both in its feeling and in its structure, the title developed by the South Koreans fully assumes its status as a basic shooter.

Too bad, however, that its very uneven realization prevents it from living up to today's standards.",,"Gungrave anime fans might be able to crowbar some fun out of this, but we strongly recommend that they don’t even try.

Because of how basic and repetitive the gameplay can be, it’s easy to lose interest after a few levels and not find the experience of playing it fulfilling. On the other hand, there are times when it’s good to just turn the brain off and have fun, and when that mood strikes, Gungrave G.O.R.E. is just what the doctor ordered.",,"This is a proudly old-fashioned game that, at least, feels different from all the current action games.",,"Gungrave G.O.R.E is a decent game. It's not the best shooter, but it is often very entertaining if just for the spectacle. It has a few issues, mostly in level design, and the story isn't particularly memorable, but there's plenty of fun to be had in chainsawing your enemies with a transforming coffin.","Gungrave G.O.R.E lacks quality-of-life found in more recent games. While I’m a sucker for nostalgia, G.O.R.E tends to be more frustrating than fun. There are some exciting moments of arcadey action, but you’ll likely grow tired of the waves of enemies and artificial difficulty that stems from annoying mission objectives. I’m glad Grave is back from the dead, but I can’t help but want more.",,"Negatives aside, Gungrave G.O.R.E is a blast when it gets going.

Like its predecessors G.O.R.E is an arcade style third person shooter that lacks variety in gameplay, enemies and level design. Often monotone and with an uninteresting plot, it still has its moments once the gameplay loop gets going. But overall it could have been much more and only functions as an elaborate protoype for a potentially good Gungrave game.",,"Polish issues aside, Gungrave G.O.R.E. is a nostalgic trip to a certain era of action game design, dressed up in improved visuals and performance.

The game is a spectacle action game that has failed to learn anything meaningful from 20 years of game design evolution, from the importance of having an interesting or charismatic lead to gameplay which gives the player options and which evolves over time. The levels show a strong disposition towards dark and grey, and the plot won’t do much to engage you either. If you’re a diehard Gungrave fan who has been longingly awaiting the franchise’s revival, there might be something for you here; for anyone else, there are far better offerings out there.",,,"An attractive action game that you don't have to worry about reloading the gun.

Its concept is interesting but it can feel quite repetitive.",,,"Gungrave GORE is a game out of time even if you look at it through the lens of nostalgia. Beyond a narrative context that has not been received, but in line with the two past games, everything from gameplay to level design is too old, even when it manages to entertain in a rather genuine way.",,,,,,"A gothic and bloody old-style TPS with massive explosions and BIG guns.

I would be infinitely more disappointed going into this game as a diehard fan of the series and seeing what a disservice G.O.R.E does to the Gungrave name. It’s astonishing to see Iggymob charging $50 for a low-budget, niche game riddled with unoriginal gameplay, multiple soft-locks, atrocious level design, and laughable voice acting.",,,,,,,,,"Gungrave G.O.R.E is a thorough examination of what games offered us before they transformed into 40-hour cinematic masterpieces.

This is one quest that even the bravest warriors would be wise to avoid.",,,"Fans of Dungeons and Dragons will enjoy the characters and setting of Dark Alliance but the game doesn't do much with its combat, exploration or looting elements and ends up feeling underwhelming in all areas. If the game gets the technical improvements it badly needs and can tighten up the gameplay, then this could be a decent co-op brawler. But for now it all feels a bit unfinished.",,"Dark Alliance is riddled with fundamental errors with its non-functioning AI, lackluster loot game, and terrible camera. It is flooded with good ideas that seem awfully unfinished, badly designed and implemented that draw it downwards to being another trash looter hack ‘n’ slash game with a potential for a bit more greatness if it had more time invested in it.",,,Dark Alliance is the type of game for people looking to blow off steam with their friends. It's such an exploration ride that I just wanted to keep playing it all day long. The fun combat and loot system kept me coming back even if it is a shame the story set in the D&D universe written by a prolific writer fails to live up to its potential. It's also baffling that almost no love was given to the game on the PS5 to utilize its power or even the DualSense controller. At $40 though almost all of its flaws can be overlooked for just plain old fun.,,,,,,,,,,"This game is a worthy successor to the Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance titles. Though the combat can become a bit repetitive, it's fast-paced and engaging for the most part. While playing solo, it's fun and challenging, and it's easy to see how it would flourish with a full group of players. It isn't perfect, but the over-the-top voice acting and character models, respect for Dungeons and Dragons lore, and intuitive combat make for a charming package. It's casual enough for anyone to pick up and play while retaining enough Dungeons and Dragons standards to keep experienced players of the tabletop game content.

With some patching, this game could really break through to another level of quality, but we’ll have to see what develops in that regard. I understand that Tuque has several things lined up for the next six months. They’re planning on new free DLC and a new expansion, Echoes of the Blood War, and that’s cool. However, I think they really need to take a hard look at the base game and make several major adjustments to it before worrying about DLC, because if the base game doesn’t get right, there might not be much of an audience to bring back in with DLC and expansions.",,,"I just didn’t expect it could be this bad. Dark Alliance is a functionally broken product. When enemies simply ignore you as you carve their health down to zero, when there’s so little to the game that that’s all you’re doing, and when the multiplayer experience is only superior because it’s a chance to share the misery with someone else, some passable graphics and one neat checkpointing system aren't anywhere near enough to redeem this game. This is the poorest handling of a license since Superman 64.",,,,,,Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance is a fun action game to play with friends whose deep combat gets overshadowed by a clunky lock-on mechanic and untimely framerate drops.,,,"If you love co-op based games, just look elsewhere, or simply wait before Dark Alliance will get all the necessary fixes and story expansions.

As ever, it’s fun battling your way through dungeons with friends, collecting loot as you go – especially once you’ve powered up your characters and learned some new moves. But until the camera has been tweaked to give you a better view, enemy AI has been improved and bugs have been quashed, the action will always be accompanied by an element of frustration and disappointment. It might be a good idea to wait for a patch or two before jumping in, basically.","Dark Alliance has the core of a fun game, but many design decisions and some very spotty enemy AI prevent the game from fully taking flight. While the game still feels early, there is some fun to be had running around and taking advantage of Dark Alliance's many issues.

If you really want page after page of stats and character story then this will probably leave you wanting.",,,,,,"Your perception of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance is going to heavily depend on how you want to play. If you want to go solo, prepare to toil away at the easiest difficulty level before taking on anything else. If you're planning to go with a team and don't mind the current restrictions, then you'll find this to be an enjoyable romp despite some occasional quirks.

It's nothing to set the world on fire but it's a perfectly enjoyable throwback to dungeon crawling hack-and-slash classics that'll work for you all the more if you've got a group of friends who yearn to go back in time to a simpler experience. Future content updates will only improve Dark Alliance and we'd urge you to give it a try for yourself.",,,,"A tragically awful attempt to revive the Dark Alliance name, with horribly repetitive combat, empty storytelling, and a dragon horde’s worth of bugs.","Hopefully the team in charge of the project will improve this perfectible recipe, but full of potential, over the updates.",,,"Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance has the potential to become a fun showcase for the long-running franchise. Despite the issues, none of these are game-breaking bugs, and it is a passable RPG. Now we just have to see if Tuque Games has what it takes to turn things around. Fans of Dungeons & Dragons, of which there are untold millions, will love the lore and story of Dark Alliance. Who knows if their love of the franchise will translate into enough sales to warrant a sequel? If so, then there is a lot of work to do, but we’ve seen plenty of comebacks before, and we’ll no doubt see more in the future.

But with promise comes optimism; Tuque Games has a robust DLC and expansion roadmap planned, so its continued investment in the game could lead to patches ameliorating my gripes. If it does, you’ll find that Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance reaches the lofty heights of its renowned spiritual predecessors. But if Tuque Games neglects these issues, Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance will remain a fun but prohibitively frustrating game I can recommend to series devotees and few others.","Ultimately, Dark Alliance is a flawed game that provides a perfunctory single-player experience that fails to dazzle or delight. While there is some depth and enjoyment deep within the heart of the multiplayer experience, Dark Alliance fails to provide the engrossing gameplay experience that is required in order to sustain the sort of long-term community clearly desired by the game’s creators.

In some ways, it feels like a work-in-progress, though most of the time, it can still provide the challenging experience that it promises regardless of the platform. The addition of an open environment is hands down the best idea, as it provides the off-road adventure with a new side that’s more or less based on exploration. At the same time, it feels like it generates a high replayability level, and at the end of the day, this is what helps keep a game alive a long time after its launch.",,,"Cleaning objects is generally not too fun to do, but in PowerWash Simulator that changes to a zen experience.

The few updates made with controls, shooting, and lighting are nice, but not enough to justify the $60 price tag. The games are still worth revisiting, especially if you’ve never played the original releases, but only if you aren’t playing on PC or the Switch as those versions seem to share the bulk of issues the game is currently experiencing.

These half-cooked remasters show some qualities but are clearly not enough to celebrate such masterpieces like GTA III, Vice City and San Andreas.","The first polygonal trilogy of GTA is back on the shelves with a definitive edition that struggles to hide the results of a gestation that is perhaps all too fast, a matrix of remasters that would undoubtedly have deserved greater attention in the polishing phase. Although the three titles in the package showcase valuable technical interventions, as well as a good assortment of playful revisions, the result of the modernization process put in place by Grove Street Games stops at sufficiency.

All of the games here do look better and play better than the originals, which technically does make these versions the definitive ones, but it feels like a missed opportunity at the end of the day.

in-nightmare,,,,,,,,In Nightmare has a decent idea at its base and some nice visuals but the fundamental gameplay makes too many missteps to make this one worth playing.,,,,,,,,,,,,The overall idea of In Nightmare is solid. The trapped-in-a-child’s-nightmare vibe and slow unveiling of his past traumas feel fresh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, In Nightmare hits the mark. It fits its self-defined genre, and was an otherwise decent game. Its overabundance of mechanics and reliance on standard horror game features hold the title back from being more unique than it could be. Though In Nightmare should not supplant any of your favorite horror titles, the game’s narrative and attempt to differentiate itself through its visuals might just be enough to garner a curious horror game fan’s attention.",,,,,,,,"In Nightmare is an experience that will leave players more frustrated than frightened. The story is decent enough, if predictable, but it quickly loses steam since you can guess what'll happen and the pantomimed scenes are too vague. The gameplay teeters between fine to unplayable due to technical issues and an overall design that favors trial and error and memorization versus crafting a more dynamic challenge. All of those things rob the game of a scare factor; there's nothing really horrifying about what you're up against. The ideas are sound, but unless you have to play every single horror game out there, you can safely skip In Nightmare and not miss a thing.",,,,"In Nightmare is a beautiful landscape touching on the process of working through trauma and bad memories. With stunning visuals and incessant monsters, you’ll feel like a child again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In Nightmare is a pale competitor to other titles of the horror-adventure genre. Stealth that’s preferable to charge through, puzzles that are the blandest of time-wasters and a narrative of dark themes burdened with typos and poor delivery. Real nightmares threaten your sleep with terror and fear, whereas In Nightmare only threatens to bore or frustrate you to death.",,,,,,"Despite the confusing narrative, In Nightmare is still fun. The puzzles are varied and delightful to work through. And while not the scariest game I’ve played, there’s plenty of anxiety to be had sneaking around enemies and solving puzzles under duress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In essence, In Nightmare is a narrative heavy puzzle game where all too often you must engage in more action heavy scenes in order to progress. That, coupled with frequent sections where you must navigate a room of either a single monster or multiple and avoid detection, caused the game to wear out its welcome sooner than it should have. When it’s just puzzles where you have have all the time in the world to reason out is when the game works best, and I found myself wishing for more of that as the game went on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Unless you have the patience of a saint, I would steer clear of In Nightmare. It really is a shame, as there’s an interesting story being told from Bill’s eyes and a really vibrant and vivid world with a unique style to explore, but any semblance of gameplay is horribly hampered by a nightmare of poor gameplay designs. I’ll keep dreaming of how much I’d enjoy this game once it sees some quality of life improvements show up to fix the plethora of lackluster stealth gameplay and frustrating “puzzles”.",,,,,,,,,A quaint art direction and an occasional well-conceived puzzle are not enough to redeem this painful slog through a child's living nightmare. Trial-and-error instakill sections and some of the worst hide and seek stealth since Sanity of Morris ensure the greatest nightmare will be your own.,,,,"While at first glance I thought this was going to be a horror game in the same way that Grabbed by the Ghoulies is; that is to say very silly and a bit over the top. But I was pleasantly surprised at In Nightmare, as I said horror is not usually my thing but the subject matter here and the way it’s handled is quite masterful. I mean the whole game is extremely relatable as Bill discovers the thing that some of us have already; and that thing is that more often than not we create our own monsters via our subconscious. The situations or people we monster-fy were never as bad as we thought they were. And hopefully I haven’t said too much, because this game is a wonderful experience, despite the wonky jump button and iffy sonar system I enjoyed my time in this nightmare very much. And while there isn’t much replay value outside of trying to 100% everything; at a value price In Nightmare is more than worth it just on the story alone.",,"In Nightmare could have been great, but the atmosphere and environments aren’t enough to make up for the woeful frame rate, frustrating enemy encounters, and overall tedium of the gameplay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
balan-wonderworld,,,,,,,,,"Balan Wonderworld is a very ambitious looking game, and yet it manages to accomplish very little. I was very much expecting a new IP I would enjoy and ended up sorely disappointed by it. I don’t know what Square Enix's higher ups are thinking right now, but I'm guessing that it's not “This is the next big thing"".",,,,"Sometimes, Balan Wonderworld evokes a bygone era of platformers very well, but this is all too fleeting a feeling. All the creativity seems to have gone into the characters and music while the actual act of platforming leaves a lot to be desired. It’s far from the worst modern platformer, but given the names involved, it’s a thoroughly underwhelming one.",,,,,,"In its best moments, Balan Wonderworld is indeed a wondrous experience, but it becomes hard to keep dreaming with its lack of depth and attention to playability.",,,,,,,,,"There's a lot of content in Balan Wonderworld, but the amount of backtracking and costume swapping makes returning to previous levels feel too demanding. Pairing Balan Wonderworld's small environments with its lackluster 3D platforming fails to provide the AAA entertainment players come to expect from similar modern titles. The main issue with the game isn't its outdated take on an already niche genre, but that its core gameplay isn't fun and its supporting elements aren't amusing. Balan Wonderworld is hard to recommend to anyone outside of diehard genre fans considering the quality of other 3D platformers on the market.",,,,,,"Your enjoyment of Balan Wonderworld is going to depend on your tolerance for primitive 3D level design. Strip away the unnecessary costumes and their poorly implemented management system — and fire those Balan’s Bouts into the sun — and you might have a nice throwback to a more experimental time of platform gaming, one that would be easier to recommend. But sadly, you can’t just strip those elements away. They're here, and they’re ruining what is otherwise an enjoyable rewind to the golden era of the mascot platformer.",,,,,,"If you’re the patient sort, chances are you’ll have a good time with Balan Wonderworld overall. Costume management is clunky, but you’ll deal with it in order to find the secrets hidden within each world, and you won’t be too perturbed by the eagerly respawning enemies and repetitive Balan Bout sequences. For most players though, everything combined will probably prove to be a little too much. Balan Wonderworld is a game that’s capable of bringing out both delight and dismay in its players, though it serves up a little too much of the latter at times to be easily recommended.",,,,,,"Mixed feelings: graphics and sound offer a surreal and engaging experience, but gameplay wise, several camera hiccups and uneven level design may become frustrating. Balan is able to appeal to your inner child... If that child is a patient one.","Balan Wonderworld features a range of interesting ideas that are plagued by dated mechanics. Even after losing yourself in the absurd universe, you are quickly brought back to reality due to the rigid movement and odd control scheme that oppose expectations of the genre. Although the game has a lot of charm, it does little to stand out amongst the crowd and due to this, it can be rightfully overlooked.",,,,,,,,"Balan Wonderworld is a great idea on paper, and it's perfectly playable from start to finish, but it's held back by some baffling design decisions and boring gameplay. The idea of a protagonist who swaps between costumes to collect Mario-style shines could be great, but the costumes are too simple, the environments are too boring, and the gameplay is too basic. It could possibly be a good game for extremely young players due to its low difficulty and cartoony graphics, but even then, I would recommend one of the many other offerings intended for that demographic instead.",,,,,,"If you have a soft spot for classic 3D platformers and imaginative game worlds, you'll have a lovely time with Balan Wonderworld. With a heartfelt story, plenty of cuteness, a clever costume system, and oodles of stages to master; it's one incredible adventure.",,,,,,"Balan Wonderworld offers a great story, accompanied by an absolutely wonderful soundtrack. That's about all it offers, though. In the end, mediocre graphics and rough gameplay make for a rather disappointing package.",,"Balan Wonderworld stands out as easily one of the worst 3D platformers in the past decade. There was no good reason for Square Enix and Yuji Naka to salvage this train wreck and it's an embarrassment that this game was allowed to be released at all in its current state. When the game’s only redeeming qualities are some good music and neat DualSense features, something clearly went wrong here. There is no doubt that Balan Wonderworld should've remained locked up in the game design vault it was conceived in twenty years ago.",,,,,"Frustrating in its playability, abstruse in most of its rules, the soft falls without a net. No drama to report: like a drunken cannon-man, Balan Wonderworld misses his target. Too imprecise for the youngest, too basic for fans of the genre, he cannot count on any of his costumes to hide his shortcomings.","If only Naka, staying true to form, had given the whole thing a dose of high speed; his work only holds together when it hurtles past our eyes, growing vivid with velocity.",,"Balan Wonderworld feels like it’s shrouded in mystery because there’s a woeful lack of explanation for the majority of its mechanics. Nobody should be left looking for external guides to gather even the most basic information for a game aimed at children. When added to the frustrating management of the game’s costumes (including those that can’t jump in a platformer), its underdeveloped story, the overly simplistic platforming, and the tortuous Balan Bouts, this is a game that had promise but is ruined by a multitude of bizarre design decisions.",,,,,,,"While not reaching its full potential, Balan Wonderworld is a grand and well designed adventure, which runs superbly on PS5. It’s perfect for family co-op play. [Issue#1, p.76]",,,"And yet for all that, I kind of adore Balan Wonderworld, to a degree that's surprised me. Maybe it's just come along at the right time, when I needed a colourful comfort blanket of a thing, a nostalgia strip as strange and insubstantial as watching a YouTube compilation of 90s TV adverts. Maybe it's because my expectations were low - Sonic Adventure has always been the game where the scales fell away from my eyes when it comes to Sega's mascot, and to Sonic Team, and I can't say I've ever enjoyed too much of the series since...Or maybe it's just because this is how games used to be, and sometimes it's comforting to slip into a 90s netherworld, and back into the old ways. When games were often clunky, unexplained, awkward and often downright frustrating. Balan Wonderworld is all those things, an almost too exacting facsimile of a type of second tier 90s platformer that never quite achieved greatness, even if it's fascinating all the same.",,,,,,,"Balan Wonderworld had good intentions, but it get two of its core mechanics wrong: its control and the suit system. It’s still enjoyable, although not as much as it could have been.",,"Balan Wonderworld is a passable platformer marred by a string of increasingly baffling design decisions. It has charm by the bucketload and off-the-wall concepts that land well in spite of themselves, but the experience is inconsistent at best and frustrating at worst. There is a good game in here somewhere, and it is great fun at points, but waiting for those points isn’t really worth it.","Balan Wonderworld contains elements of what could have been a stellar platformer with its compelling ideas of advancement notions. However, its ineptitude with several gameplay design decisions makes it a constant struggle of unfun progression, questionable execution, and ultimately a heap of lost potential. Regardless of how much you desire to play it, I highly implore waiting for a sale because it is just not worth the full $60 price tag. Now, all I desire from the remnants of this failed title is a movie with its superb cutscene direction and animation. That is something I could get behind.",,,,"Balan Wonderworld deserved to be far more than average, as the final game is a marked improvement over the demo. It's beautiful a lot of the time, character designs are mostly wonderful, the unique ideas that appear in each level are great fun… however the overall execution is simply lacking something important. The repetitive bouts, rough edges, and the sometimes awful physics make this a much harder title to recommend. It is full of bubbly unique charm, and is mostly heart-warmingly fun, but many will be put off by the slow, restrictive design, despite this being designed around it. Hopefully, the game will get some traction.",Balan Wonderworld has a strong artistic direction and an amazing soundtrack but also many limitations in terms of gameplay and graphics.,"The nostalgic breath is felt, and it cannot be denied that some idea, if treated in a different way, could have easily given its fruits. Yet, the new effort of Naka and Oshima collapses under the weight of a shoddy, disoriented realization, mostly unable to pay homage to the old days without being unnecessarily cumbersome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,An interesting 3D-platformer with a very unique style and a few good ideas. But Balan feels outdated and shows some design flaws.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While Balan Wonderworld has a few interesting ideas tucked up its costumed sleeves, none of them are executed particularly well, which makes the game feel like a real chore to play. From its dozens of forgettable costumes and frustrating mechanics to its uninspired visuals, it’s hard to recommend adding this one to your PS5 library, especially when there are much better platformers like Astro’s Playroom and Sackboy: A Big Adventure already available.",,,,,"Balan Wonderworld offers some good and colorful stories for the younger gamers, but there are too many technical problems and the gameplay is far too rigid and abstruse.","Balan Wonderworld is a disappointing platformer that feels like a wasted opportunity. There are some bright spots in its visuals, music, and boss fights, but the bulk of the game is characterized by stale level design, overly simplistic gameplay, useless power-ups, and annoying mini-games. It throws a lot of ideas at the wall, but lacks the polish to do any of it well. And with a price tag of $60, it's a hard sell.",,"The finished state of Balan Wonderworld is disappointing to say the least. For all of its style, I was really interested to see how they would expand upon the preview. The aesthetic and characters are there, the music is captivating, the level design made me want to explore and experiment where I could, and the abilities mostly gave me options to do so. However, these things are held down by a lot of contrivances and outright holes in either functionality or context.",,"Balan Wonderworld feels like a game from another time. In a different era the rough edges, inconsistent mechanics, and formulaic design may have been things that players could overlook, but in this moment in time, it's a 3D platformer of a quality that can't compete with polished modern-day contemporaries from Nintendo, Sony, and the like. It has its merits and delivers an unexpectedly mentally stimulating platformer when it manages to play to its strengths, but even a stopped clock is right twice a day.",,"Balan Wonderworld is a lesson in how a video game can go completely wrong, missing every target it attempts to hit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's a game made for children, which is why having a more simplistic edge may be useful, but the overall level of quality is perhaps not there.

There are few, if any, redeeming features here, and anything that’s partially enjoyable – like the simple combat with its humorous finishing animations – is ruined by a dreadful camera. There are far better family-friendly adventure games out there and so, even if you or your kids have a love for Zorro, you should spend your money elsewhere.",,,,,,,"There are charming aspects to the game past its initial impression. I considered dropping it early on, but I’m glad I didn’t: some of the later settings are very picturesque, and there are funny moments throughout. While the missions followed a pattern, I could see an attempt at differentiating the levels. I wish this game felt better to play; I wanted it to succeed. Unfortunately, there aren’t many people I can recommend Zorro The Chronicles to. If your child is a fan of the show, the game is worth picking up, but if you’re a more general fan of the Zorro franchise, it’s worth waiting for another outing – Zorro always rides again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm glad that I waited for Zorro The Chronicles to get a patch before reviewing it but even without the abundance of bugs, it's still an overall underwhelming adventure. It does show promise, though, so I'd gladly play a sequel.",,,,,,"Zorro presents a game meant for young kids, but the developer underestimates a bit what the standard is these days.

Games have been turned around from disastrous launches to become quite well-loved things, and I do think there is room for Babylon’s Fall to grow, while also being a decent time (in the right conditions) right now. It’s certainly content rich in its current state already, and while it’s probably a bit of a gamble throwing money into something that might not be around for too long, I can still see this developing a community.","Babylon's Fall starts out as a seemingly grindy game, but there are some elements that unlock in later sections that could help to break up the repetitiveness. Being able to craft or enhance weapons is likely to alleviate some of the need for grinding for gear that occurs in the first few Cloisters of the tower. There are also quests and orders to unlock outside of the main story and daily, weekly, or seasonal missions.

The core combat feels stiffer than my left wrist, which is currently recovering from a broken bone.

Stacking microtransactions on top of it all leaves a nasty aftertaste that Platinum Games is going to have to wash out for a long time to come. Babylon’s Fall is good for some mindless, repetitive dungeon crawling, but certainly not for the launch MSRP of $59.99.","We’re sad to say that after years of waiting Babylon’s Fall is easy to skip. While other attempts at a game as a service had their moments, its combat is barebones and clunky, while it feels determined to pull players through with meager rewards and muddy graphics.

We all know that PlatinumGames are capable of games so much more than this, and Square Enix should probably step back from their live service efforts, because they simply haven't cracked it.",,,,,,"Babylon's Fall immediately went from a highly anticipated exclusive to a memorable disappointment: a shame, because it had good ideas.","Babylon's Fall is a huge wasted opportunity. Backed by ingenious mechanics like Gideon Arms or Dynamis Skills, the combat system had the potential to shine in a new and intense light, but the questionable choice of postponing the unlocking of crafting and skills related to the three races to the endgame slows down. the progression enormously, placing the player in front of an unbearable monotony and encouraging him to abandon the product within a few hours. If we add to this an almost non-existent history and an obsolete technical plant of at least two generations, there is no reason why you might want to climb the Tower of Babel.",Babylon's Fall gets wrong everything that you can get wrong in a game.,,,,,,,,,,"Babylon's Fall isn't a broken action RPG, but it isn't a good one, either – and it's one of the ugliest games in several console generations.",,"Oh my. Platinum Games is one of Japan’s finest developers when it comes to action games, but this one is a real stinker and not worthy of the studio’s name. Babylon’s Fall? More like Babylon’s fail.",,,,"The true problem of Babylon’s Fall is that it has no sense of identity. There’s nothing that sets it apart from games like it, and it only shows itself as a poor comparison to other, free, games. Babylon’s Fall feels like it was made to check a box, because it is just so empty and slapped together. The cookie-cutter levels only serve to wear you down as you just want to make it through main missions that are just about your only way to play the game.",,"From a dismal effort on the front of graphics, user interface, player onboarding, sound design, and essentially every other aspect of game design, Babylon’s Fall is a failure. Games have bounced back from disastrous launches in the past, but in this case, I feel like it may be best to let sleeping dogs lie. The game’s one and only saving grace is that Platinum Games truly are the kings of combat, and while Babylon’s Fall is nowhere near the top of their collection of works, hacking and slashing your way through the Tower of Babel is at least, occasionally, kind of fun. It is just a crying shame that there is very little else to enjoy from the game; there isn’t anything pretty to look at, nice to listen to, or easy to engage with.",,,,Babylon Fall is a game that can entertain you for a couple of hours but quickly becomes quite monotonous. It has a history that is not very inspired with combat that lacks depth.,,"BABYLON'S FALL is a huge disappointment. The initial charm of the combat system fades off very quickly and the level design feed that feeling of monotony of boredom. This is a shame, as the combat and the narrative concepts have so much potential.","Babylon's Fall does nothing to be, if not remarkable, memorable: at least not in a positive way.",,,,,Babylon’s Fall is an early contender for the worst game of 2022.,"Babylon’s Fall is the first console GaaS developed by Platinum Games and it shows. Technically anchored to the past and artistically uninspired, the action game developed by the creators of Bayonetta hides its best features behind an abysmal story mode that lets the gameplay breath only after more than 10 hours of mandatory tutorials. Post-game content is interesting and the gameplay loop might be engaging after a good amount of updates to fix the rough edges, but will players keep faith in the developers after being welcomed in that way?",,,,,,,,"Babylon's Fall offers many interesting ideas, but Platinum Games fails to deliver anything polished and fun, seemingly more interested in its cash shop. Another game as service gone wrong.",,,"Babylon’s Fall feels like a game that came out a decade ago, both visually and in its gameplay. Combat is clunky and boring most of the time, outside of a few highlights here and there. There’s nothing that encourages players to engage with the live-service elements, despite it being a core tenet of the experience. It’s like someone fed a computer a bunch of information and had it generate an action RPG. Babylon's Fall’s biggest credit is that it’s technically competent; the game isn’t broken or held back by major bugs or issues. It’s a shame, because PlatinumGames has proven itself to be an impressive talented studio. Unfortunately, Babylon's Fall manages to disappoint on just about every front.","I can in no way recommend Babylon’s Fall. It’s the most disappointing experience I’ve played in years, a combination of poorly defined ideas and a lacklustre sense of visual identity that does nothing to feel like a PlatinumGames experience. That’s the most frustrating thing of all, that a studio with such a strong back catalogue could release such a basic, uninspiring title in this modern era, as if they just handed the project to the interns and forgot about it until it was too late. Whatever positives there might be are few and far between in a title that likely won’t get a chance to fix itself before Square Enix eventually pulls the plug.",,,,"Babylon’s Fall is not an awful game, its just not a very good one and while I would never tell anyone what to do with their money, I will strongly suggest you avoid this one as it’s fate will surely be the same as the tower for which its named.","Babylon's Fall is a baffling game that lacks any distinct vision, both in terms of gameplay and artistic design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In its current state after a few updates, Babylon’s Fall is worth trying through the demo before you should consider picking it up on a discount. Until the team can overhaul the progression system to ensure most things aren't unlocked after a dozen hours of playing, Babylon's Fall likely will continue to lose players early on. There is definitely potential here and a lot of the bosses and areas are worth experiencing, but it is hard to recommend at even half price right now unless you click with the combat in the demo and want to see more.",,,,,,"My time with Babylon's Fall was a strange one. I don't recall ever disliking a game so heavily, only to fall in love with it moments later. The satisfaction driven nature of the experience is a road worth taking, but the slow burn isn't for everyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efootball-2022,,,,,,,"Konami couldn't have chosen a worse way to bring its football franchise to the new generation, as eFootball 2022 seems more like a mobile game ported for PS5 and now Konami is facing an uphill battle to regain the trust of the community and come back from what could be the worst sports simulation in the history of video games.",,,"It may be free and as some of its aspects are concerned, fairly fun to play. But on the other hand, eFootball 2022 is plagued with horrible bugs and glitches, graphical monstrosities and outdated physics. As a whole, it is something you may enjoy in a short run. But in this state, if the game is not improved, Konami may change the price from “free” to “paying us back” – it still won't save the poor franchise.",,,,,,,,Worsens everything that was done well in the past.,,,,,,,,A disastrous start to the post-PES era. The only consolation? It surely can’t get any worse from here.,,,,,,"eFootball 2022 in its latest version (1.0) shows some occasional glimmers of former PES glory, but it is still painfully far from being a full-fledged game, both in terms of features and gameplay, which is ruined by sluggishness, weak AI, poor animations and questionable physics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A shameful launch of a barely playable, graphically embarrassing game that shames the memory of PES and may have killed the new franchise before it’s even begun.",,,,,,,"eFootball 2022 does show some signs of a great soccer-game after update 1.0.0. However the game remains very rough around the edges – not only on the pitch, but also when it comes to presentation.",,,,,"eFootball debuts terribly with its new game as service model, but it's not its only problem: lacks of content and lots of technical and visual issues puts the new Pro Evolution Soccer far behind its own legacy. [Not recommended]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"eFootball 1.0.0 version is a substantially better game than the one we got in september. However, it does little more than the bare minimum to actually be considered a game - what we had before was pretty much a tech demo. With an array of missing features and unforgivable absences in its game modes, as well as an improved yet inconsistent gameplay, eFootball is to PES what MK Dons is to Wimbledon FC.",,,"Yes, at least eFootball 2022 does now have a fully-fledged mode to take it past the point of being a demo, but it’s still lacking so much more than you’d expect from a 1.0 version of a game.",,,,,,,,,,Quotation forthcoming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
