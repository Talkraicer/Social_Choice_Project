elden-ring,"Elden Ring rewards your curiosity in many ways, be it items, runes or a pathway to another area, but mostly it’s a story to tell your friends when you are sharing tales around the bonfire. It does not force feed tutorials down your throat, but instead it leans far the opposite way by not telling you much at all and lets you explore and find things out on your own. There is no true quest log, no points of interest on a map or no arrows pointing you in the right direction, so there is a good chance you’ll miss some of the best caves and areas of the game. Because of all of this, Elden Ring is forcing me to find all of that out on my own and it is one of the most rewarding games I have ever played. I will continue to explore the Land Between for many hours to come. I’m just not in a hurry.","FromSoftware has combined everything they learned while designing their past games and created something that will stand as a benchmark for years to come. Elden Ring is probably the most accessible game in their Soulsborne series, but it is very difficult. This difficulty and the esoteric nature of their design isn’t for everyone, but if you like fantasy RPGs there is no question as to whether you should give this a try. The amount of enjoyment, excitement, wonder, and reward I have felt while playing this game is unmatched. I don’t think I’ve ever experienced anything like it before. Elden Ring is easily the best game I’ve played so far this year, and I know it’s early but it should be in the discussion when talking about the greatest games of all time.","From its humble beginnings as a weird, brutally difficult new project that even its publisher had little faith in, the Souls series has grown into a vessel through which FromSoftware has helped change how we look at, and play, video games. And now, Elden Ring does the same for the Souls series itself. Years of gameplay refinements and revisions blend together with major franchise shifts such as the move to an open world and giving players far more freedom in how they set about saving said world. The result is a title that goes beyond anything Hidetaka Miyazaki and his team have given us before, both as a game and as an experience.","Elden Ring is a crowning achievement for FromSoftware and undoubtedly the very best gameplay experience they've yet delivered - and that's really saying something given this developer's incredible back catalogue. The Lands Between deftly combine breathless open world exploration, stunning artistry, immaculate world-building and wondrous adventure with classic Dark Souls combat and dungeon-crawling, resulting in not just the best Souls game to date, but a candidate for one of the very best video games ever made.","Apart from the summoning issue that is found when attempting to play with others, Elden Ring is a triumph. It looks great, it plays like a dream and it provides a world in which you can spend hours, just wandering about, picking fights.","For the Dark Souls fan this is a dream come true. For an open-world game this is a strong statement in a stale, oversaturated and by the book field of games. For a videogame, Elden Ring is a triumph right there with every iconic game that came before it. With unparalleled game design and a captivating sense of adventure, this is the best game FromSoftware ever made.","Ultimately, Elden Ring revolutionizes the Souls genre for the better. Now I'm looking forward to seeing if expansions will be released to expand the story, but for now, I'm back to continuing touring its exceptional world.","Miyazaki and his team deliver one of the best video games ever made that elevates open-world, action RPGs to a whole new level.","Elden Ring is the game Souls fans have been waiting for. From the open world design, to riding into battle on Torrent's back, and the dark narrative woven through the world, this is a clear Game of the Year frontrunner that will have us all ensnared for a long time to come.",Miyazaki and company have delivered a fantasy epic that viciously scrapes and claws its way into the pantheon of unforgettably important video games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Elden Ring is FromSoftware's most remarkable work so far and stands confidently as one of the greatest RPGs of all time.,"Despite some annoying performance issues, Elden Ring is a masterpiece. The combat, enemy variety, exploration, music, and open world are top notch. I’ve been playing it daily across all platforms alongside other games all month, and look forward to doing that all year as I try new builds, help friends, and try to do everything I want in this triumph of a video game.","Elden Ring is an epic. With a beautifully designed open world, FromSoftware takes the Souls formula to new heights and crafts a journey that needs to be played.","Elden Ring manages to draw the player into a fascinating world for many hours, with refined gameplay that fits perfectly with the freedom granted to the player. A sumptuous but imperfect work, which fails to completely overcome some of the historical flaws of Hidetaka Miyazaki's productions. Flaws that, however, can't diminish the scope of a masterpiece destined to leave an indelible mark on the videogame world and to set new standards for the souls-like and open-world genres.","Elden Ring is a real milestone for its developers and one of the best titles we've played in the last few years. The way it mixes the gameplay from Dark Souls with a highly refined exploration offers a really fresh take on the saturated open world market. Despite some notable technical issues, they don't put a stain in the great taste of what promises to be one of the games that leaves a mark on a whole genre, and maybe, the best game From Software has ever developed.","The sense of wonder and magic as you make your way around this mysterious and grimly beautiful world is truly extraordinary and while that does taper off somewhat by the time you reach the endgame and have seen more or less everything the game has to offer — several times over, in a lot of cases — but that doesn't detract too much from what will have otherwise been a truly remarkable adventure. Souls haters shouldn't fall for the rebrand as they'll just get burned again — Elden Ring is very much 'just' From doing what From does best, this time performing its greatest hits on the biggest stage to date. And what a wonderful thing that is to witness.",Elden Ring is a perfect experience for every souls veteran and its welcoming enough for the newcomers. It is a true evolution of the souls-like type of action RPG.,"Elden Ring offers up a gorgeous open world that is enticing and exciting to explore, along with excellent combat variety, amazing bosses to fight, and intricate dungeons to tackle. It might feel a little familiar, but this could well be FromSoftware’s best game to date.","With its new open-world dimension, Elden Ring brilliantly fleshes out FromSoftware's already highly effective formula and offers Souls a spiritual sequel that is both ambitious and accessible. All the new features converge towards this last objective: the open world allows you to arm yourself more than ever with the epic and obligatory fights that the adventure reserves, without having the impression of walking around just to farm. And the best part is that it doesn't compromise the sense of accomplishment so important to the genre. Elden Ring is a complete, mysterious experience, where curiosity is tirelessly renewed by the feeling of discovering something for the first time. All with a sumptuous artistic direction, which makes you want to get lost, to explore. The title also welcomes new features that offer strategic choices in combat, without betraying their requirement. We only regret a slight lack of ambition for certain Legacy Dungeons, as well as the recycling of some assets and bosses. Overall, an exceptional title.",Elden Ring proves that evolution is a beautiful thing. It retains the brilliance and difficulty of its peers while moving the genre towards a new era. Purists may despise the new direction but I think it retains the best mechanics while offering so much more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
persona-5-royal,,,,"One of the best games of the last generation of consoles, and in with a very strong shout as the greatest JRPG of all time, Persona 5 Royal makes for a fantastic new addition to Xbox Game Pass. Atlus has gone to town on reworking and revamping its 2016 classic in this Royal upgrade and it pays off here with the ultimate version of a true all-timer. This next-gen version runs at a velvety smooth 4K/60FPS too, making for a truly unmissable experience that we highly recommend you dive right into. Games don't get much better than this.","Persona 5 Royal is as close to the perfect RPG as I have played in a long time. Not since the heady days of Final Fantasy VII will a game grip you so fiercely, refusing to let go. It is deep, it is beautiful and it demands to be played.","The improved storytelling and the additions Royal has, compared to the original game, is a true gift to all owners of modern platforms. Possibly due to the Phantom Thieves stealing the hearts of Atlus executives, a big audience can now dive into one of the best JRPGs out there, with hours of an immersive story and a refined gameplay that has built onto its past foundations and brings with it the promise of an exciting future.",Persona 5 Royal is an intense RPG experience with turn-based combat and a wealth of personality that has stolen our hearts.,,,"Persona 5 Royal is one of the finest JRPGS Atlus has ever produced, and thanks to the visual and performance boost of the Xbox Series X|S, it is better than ever. While I do have minor misgivings about the game's pacing during the opening act and its difficulty quirks, it is nonetheless a must-play for any JRPG fan on Xbox.",,,,"Persona 5 Royal finally debuts on Xbox to prove the masterpiece that it is. This 100+ hour adventure game features a story, gameplay, art and music that are at the pinnacle of video games.",,,"Persona 5 Royal is easily one of the best JRPGs on Xbox, which isn’t bad for a game that originally came out in 2019! A perfect blend of real-world shenanigans, mixed with some intense dungeon-crawling sections, and put together in one of the most perfectly presented packages in video games - what’s not to love? Buy it, play it on Game Pass... just make sure you experience it.",,,Quotation forthcoming.,"Excellent turn-based combat is carried further by gorgeous visuals, an incredible soundtrack, and a story filled with brilliant twists and turns. It’s available day one on Xbox Game Pass and if you’re looking for a game to put over 100 hours into (conservatively) then do yourself a favor and give this one a go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-witcher-3-wild-hunt---complete-edition,,,,"Revisiting The Witcher 3 after all the drama with CP2077 takes us back to a time when CD Projekt Red was an unstoppable force. Although we've experienced some minor technical issues with the quality mode on Xbox Series X|S prior to release, overall this free update for Witcher 3 is a fantastic package that makes what was already an excellent experience (with two wonderful expansions) an even better one. If you haven’t played The Witcher 3 already and love action RPGs, now is the perfect time to check it out. It's without a doubt one of the greatest games of all time, and if you’ve already fallen in love with it before, you’ll still have a blast reuniting with the White Wolf in this latest update. Note: This review of The Witcher 3: Next Gen is still ""in-progress"" as we've suffered a few minor technical issues as part of our review build. As mentioned above, a patch is expected to address these issues in the coming days (potentially before the update's public release), so we'll hopefully be able to return to this review later in the week and provide a final score.","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was already one of the best games of all-time, but now the Complete Edition has cemented that legacy and will ensure that it is a game which is talked about for many more years to come.",,,,,,,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a must play title for any gamer, and the next gen upgrade is an excellent excuse to jump back into the bleak monster ridden world.",,"The masterpiece becomes a legend with this Complete Edition. The same The Witcher 3 as always, but better than ever. Looks better, plays better and has more content. An essential game.",,,,"The game has never looked so good on home consoles, whether in 4K Ray-Tracing or in 60 frames per second. If this update also offers nice game comfort options, the adventure remains similar to what we knew until then, for lack of new content. Despite the number of years, The Witcher 3 remains one of the essential titles of recent years, both in terms of role-playing, history or even open world. If you haven't experienced it yet and don't have a powerful PC, then this next-gen update is a great way to experience the world of the witcher Geralt of Rivia.",,,"The Witcher 3 is nearly a masterpiece. If the combat and movement were better it would be for me. As is this is one of the best experiences in gaming, and everyone should play this version of it.","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Complete Edition joins the current generation in style. To be honest this is the best graphics work ever implemented and is worth admiring with all the technical improvements made with raytracing. In addition, the new content of the Netflix series included in the game is a great detail.","While graphics are only one component of a game, these improvements’ impacts on the experience of playing Witcher 3 are pretty large. It is still the same thrilling combat, engaging stories, and darkly detailed world as before, but the improvements allow the player to be more immersed in it than ever before. It all comes together to make one of the best games ever made even more enjoyable.

hades,,"Based on all the praise and awards Hades has received over the past year, the bar was set pretty high, some might say as high as Mount Olympus (I had to include one bad pun, sorry). I’ve tried to set this aside as I played the game and write this review, but it’s been difficult. Hades is a great game, and I feel safe saying that it’s in the upper echelon of roguelike/lite games, but in the end, I think there are a handful of issues that hold it back from being immortal (sorry, one more).",,"As expected, Hades knocks it out of the park, offering a stellar experience to Xbox players for the first time. It's every bit as incredible as it was a year ago, with punchy combat, an addictive gameplay loop and a cast of characters that prove to be charming and terrifying in the same breath. It's a shame a few frame rate issues sour the experience occasionally, but make no mistake, Hades is absolutely worth your time whether you're a fan of the genre or not.","Hades is an opus, a delectable action game that rewards your skill and reflexes with a tidal wave of rewards and progression. I can’t recall a game as generous as Hades, in terms of how good it is to play, how much the game changes with each session, with how much it gives you for beating it. It’s a matryoshka doll where every doll holds more awesomeness.",,"Hades is one of the more solid games you will find on Xbox. Undoubtedly, this summer's Xbox Game Pass must have for all subscribers.",,,,,,"Hades is a masterpiece with its extremely high level of sound, gameplay, everything is exceptional. A title you absolutely must have, an incredible piece of work. Unmissable.","Supergiant Games has very little to prove with Hades in its console version, beyond its performance and optimization. It's not just that it has been nominated for game of the year. It's that this game already managed to massively captivate critics and audiences alike in 2020. If we can add anything, I would say that Hades evolves in every way every time you play it, both playable and narratively. From what we can highlight the combat, which is the core of the game, is highly satisfying. This is a game you should at least try.","There's no shortage of great action roguelikes on Xbox, but the arrival of Hades sets a new benchmark for the genre, and sets it high. Artistically gorgeous, narratively captivating, and always a delight to play, Hades goes above and beyond what you'd expect from a game like this, resulting in a unique experience that you'll likely still find yourself diving back into long after the completion is wrapped up. Supergiant has an incredible track record, but with Hades, the studio takes its throne alongside the gods of the indie scene. Cheers, mates.",,"Hades is an excellent action game that allows players to find progression even in death. Roguelikes are normally known for their high level of difficulty, but in Hades, the greatest challenge you’ll face is trying to put it down.","Beautiful to die for, enjoyable to take in hand and terribly addictive, Hades only sins by its structure identical to each run which may displease some. In return, it offers a gripping story carried by a Greek pantheon more charismatic than ever and a perfectly brought together narrative.",,Quotation forthcoming.,,,"The charm, character, and challenging gameplay that made it an instant hit last year gives it more than enough appeal to warrant a second go.","Despite having “cleared” Hades a number of times, and having defeated the same bosses over and over again, I keep coming back for more, and a lot of that comes down to just how much damn fun the game is to play. So yeah, Hades is absolutely worth a purchase, or a second purchase even, on these new platforms. You absolutely owe it to yourself to check it out, and I can confidently say that you’ll not be disappointed.","Hades remains an absolute must-play modern masterpiece on the Xbox Series X. I’m thrilled to see new ports bring it to a new audience. With a wonderful story, memorable characters, some of the best voice acting around, a stunning soundtrack, variety that keeps things fresh even after dozens of runs, incredibly tight gameplay, and game design, which will allow even those who don’t usually care for roguelites to engage with it, this is a game that every player should try.","Hades is one of the best rogue-like games ever; with great music, stylish art design and smooth gameplay.","Hades is a near-perfect Roguelike. The game looks great, plays smoothly, and offers tons of variation. There is no boredom in this game that lets you escape, die and repeat over and over again. You just want to reach the end and after that, you want to do it again and again. There are a few minor details that could have been better, but it doesn't get much better than this.","Hades is a hellish road full of painful moments, full of satisfaction. That is to say, you will die and die a lot, but you will also learn, grow with Zagreo and overcome the expectations of the terrible Hades. Everything in this game is designed with exquisite taste, but you have to fulfill an indispensable requirement: that you enjoy roguelike tropes. That is to say, randomness, combat repetition, exacerbated difficulty and constant growth of your protagonist. If all this appeals to you, BEWARE, you're going to spend hundreds of hours glued to the controller with this little work of art.","Hades already looked great, but experiencing it in 4k on current-gen consoles is a sight to behold. Hades received numerous accolades and critical acclaim during the previous year, all of which it remains worthy of here. Supergiant has a built a name for themselves with a small but consistent library of games and Hades may be their crowing achievement (so far). The story is relatable and well written, the graphics are gorgeous and the soundtrack is worthy of live performance. While those elements are important, what matters with a game is how fun it is to play, and with the simple-but-addictive gameplay, there’s no excuse not to play Hades now that it’s available on every platform.","It’s a tough genre piece, but it’s one where dying feels like progress. The more escapes you attempt, the more story you unravel as your relationships with these characters develop. Reaching the end of a run after levelling up your upgrades and finding that right combination of boons is the perfect sense of accomplishment.","Hades finally opens the gates of Hell and swallows us – not without pleasure – in its fiery limbo. Gorgeous, intense and offering a tremendous amount of content that could almost be labelled as indecent, it is with great excitement that we return blow for blow to the infernal demons without being able to put down the controller. More than just a typical rogue-like game, Hades brilliantly manages to string together good ideas such as its social hub or its many customisable weapons. The soundtrack and the dubbing were not overlooked; on the contrary, they make for an unforgettable experience. Hell has never tasted sweeter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-stanley-parable-ultra-deluxe,,"Without wanting to sound preachy, just know that you’ve never played anything like The Stanley Parable, and this Ultra Deluxe edition just expands on that in ways I couldn’t have foreseen. There are a lot of titles that gain short term notoriety thanks to the memes or streamers reacting, but this will outlast anything else that has come before and deserves to be considered one of the very best game experiences of all time.",,"The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is an excellent expansion of a bonafide classic interactive adventure. We'll admit we were slightly concerned that returning to something so masterful, expanding and adding to such a carefully constructed experience, could somehow dilute the magic, but we needn't have worried. All of the new content here simply embellishes what came before, resulting in a wonderful piece of art that's now better, more ultra and, you might even say, deluxe than ever before. Whether you're coming to this one for the first time or returning to see what's changed, you'll be handsomely rewarded for your curiosity.",The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe doesn’t disappoint and you will enjoy all the new content included! It is buckets of fun.,,,,,"The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe expertly expands the original critically acclaimed narrative adventure with hours of brilliantly written new content and a lot more of Kevan Brighting's incredible narration. Even if you played the original, you shouldn't miss this updated version.",,,,"The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is the definitive version of Davey Wreden's game, now returning with his unforgettable story and with additional content. Every lover of good stories should play this gem.",,,,,,,"The new content is where the game truly opens up for players that have walked these office halls before, and the commentary on more modern video game design starts to creep in, in hilarious and surprising ways.",,,,,,,,,,,"The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is an essential title. Not only does it refine a classic, but it also expands on it. In its cheeky knowing manner, it celebrates and mocks the very ideology of the re-release. With plenty of laughs throughout, the zany game beckons you to explore and rewards you with nuggets of gold at each point. Strange and alluring, the secrets within will surprise and delight you, keeping you hooked on the loop. Incredibly, Crows Crows Crows have managed to create an outstanding package that is attractive to both first time and returning players, making this a truly Ultra Deluxe iteration of the game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
forza-horizon-5,"Forza Horizon 5 is a must buy game for racing fans and casual gamers alike. I don’t know how, but Playground Games has made gains over Horizon 4 that I really didn’t think would be possible. The visuals are stunning, the sound is amazing, the number of things to do is almost overwhelming and the gameplay feels refined, making it an amazing open world racing game experience. The freedom to go pretty much anywhere in the Mexican will eat up a lot of time. Sure, there have been network issues, but these seem to be disappearing, allowing for an almost flawless experience. So, why are you still reading, go play this game on Game Pass, or flip a few extra dollars for the deluxe version and you get the VIP ranking, access to two expansions and a few extra cars that you might most likely enjoy.",,Forza Horizon 5 delivers everything that made the last game enjoyable on a map that’s more fun to drive with a lot more visual diversity. While the changes and additions are largely incremental—especially when it comes to the core game experience—what’s here is good enough to warrant a recommendation for fans of the series or racing enthusiasts who’ve been meaning to try it out.,"Forza Horizon 5 is an amazing game, don’t get us wrong – if you’re a newcomer to the series you’ll likely have a blast, assuming you like car games. Returning fans though can expect a similar experience to past entries. For some, that’s where driver fatigue may very well set in. After five games, at this point, you could argue the series is no longer doing enough to protect its crown as the top open-world racer. It’s the same process of going to a festival, unlocking cars, racing a lot, levelling up and repeating the whole cycle. And the new additions - such as the EventLab - are more reliant on community efforts. It is mostly a flawless experience, but the lack of evolution is how other franchises like Need for Speed fell behind in the first place. If the Forza Horizon series is to continue, it really needs to push the formula to new horizons. It would be great to see Playground really let loose with a future entry, as it's now getting a little too comfortable with the tried and tested template.","In conclusion, play Forza Horizon 5. There has never been a better looking game, and it plays like an absolute dream. It’s full of cars, full of challenge, full of glorious visuals and played out across a world like no other.",The people over at Playground Games proved -yet again- that they are capable of delivering the very best arcade racing experience. Forza Horizon 5 is truly a superb game in a league of its own.,"Forza Horizon 5 matches a perfect score with an absolutely perfect game. If you love driving, don’t even think about anything else. Play it. Playground Games nailed it.","Although the lack of meaningful additions is obvious, Forza Horizon takes another step forward in the racing genre, offering a fun adventure in a beautiful world with plenty of things to do.","Forza Horizon 5 continues the series’ legacy, usurping Forza Horizon 4 as the new pinnacle of open-world racing and as a graphical showcase for the new generation of Xbox console.","Forza Horizon 5 is the culmination of all of Playground Games' efforts to perfect its craft, and the result is the best open-world racing game you can play. It combines the most beloved parts of Forza Horizon 3 and 4 into one ultimate racer.",,,"Forza Horizon 5 is a true masterpiece. The new Mexican setting brings in wonderful landscapes, alongside a majestic implementation of the whole graphic compartment. And the contents offered are no less, with a mountain of modes suitable for both those who prefer the single player experience and those who love co-op or competitive ones. A sumptuous work and a true statement of love to the racing games genre in general.","Forza Horizon 5 is the leap to the new generation of Xbox. Playground Games has been able to improve an almost unbeatable experience, with an exquisite localization and gameplay, which manages to offer a level of immersion rarely seen before in the open world driving genre.","Beautiful, vast, creative, varied, and exciting, Forza Horizon 5 is an incredible game that will have you hooning around Mexico for months. There's an amazing sense of variety to everything about this game, and the smart Accolades system should have many achievement hunters hooked as they explore the full extent of what this remarkable racer has to offer. Fantastic handling, interesting events, and a wonderful history-spanning selection of cars makes for an amazing experience — arguably the best game in the series to date, and inarguably the best game in the series to DOOT. See you in Mexico, amigos...",,"That’s the thing about Forza Horizon 5 - it’s like a Forza Horizon greatest hits album. The handling and fundamental mechanics remain unrivalled; the cars are still absolutely stunning; and as for Mexico as an environment… well, it’s honestly a bit mind-blowing – especially on new-gen consoles (although it works perfectly on the lower-end Xbox One S console, too). Ultimately, it’s hard to fault Forza Horizon 5 at all. Sure, it may not be brimming with exciting innovations, but it’s packed to the rafters with the entire franchise's most memorable, compelling content, informed by everything that Playground Games has learned over the last nine years. Forza Horizon is most definitely a jewel in Xbox's crown, and Forza Horizon 5 is quite possibly the shiniest of them all.","¡Ay, caramba! Forza Horizon 5 is maturing under the Mexican sun a recipe concocted by Playground Games that has already delighted millions of pilots. Like an antojito, Forza Horizon 5 can be enjoyed in a good mood with anyone, anytime. Rolling over everything that has already been technically done and taking advantage of the Xbox Series X springboard to stamp the skies, Microsoft's software climbs the volcano of fun and unleashes an exhilarating torrent to be experienced alone or with others. It’s the festival of the decade.",,"Forza Horizon 5 is undoubtedly the end of a journey that began a long time ago, culminating in the largest and richest chapter ever. Mexico shines and fascinates us, making the wonderful cars we drive even more beautiful.",,,"Forza Horizon 5 somehow raised an insurmountable bar to new heights. Playground Games continued to show off their prowess with game development and their striving to make a game that is fun for every type of player in every aspect of gameplay. Regardless of if you’re a racing fan or not, if you have Game Pass, Forza Horizon 5 needs to be the next game you play. You never know, it could be the jumping-off point into a new genre that you never knew you’d click with.","I absolutely adore Forza Horizon 5, and while it’s possible to fault it as being a bit more of the same when compared to Forza Horizon 4, I’m not sure that’s actually a bad thing. It’s a more polished experience overall, and while it may be playing it safe just a tad, it’s hard to deny that the game is a technical marvel, and a fantastic show piece for Xbox Series X and 4K displays everywhere. Even if you opt to play in performance mode to hit that sweet 60fps spot, you’ll be pleasantly surprised with how great everything looks in motion. So yes, if you’re not already convinced, do yourself a favor and check out Forza Horizon 5 when it launches this week.","Despite a few minor quibbles, Forza Horizon 5 is a triumph for its series, taking everything the last several titles set up so well and making a bigger and better game than its predecessors. Any fan of racing games needs to check it out now, and even if you’re not usually into the genre, you may surprise yourself with how well it pulls you in. Forza Horizon 5 is a taste of gaming nirvana that is not to be missed.","Forza Horizon 5, the latest masterpiece of the Playground team, manages to be a flawless production in almost every sense.",,,,"Overall, I’m extremely happy with how Forza Horizon 5 has turned out. The variety in activities as well as care and attention put into its mechanics and world makes Mexico such a delight to explore. It’s most certainly the best game in the series, and could well be the best game on Xbox right now.","Is Forza Horizon 5 a good Forza Horizon? Of course, it’s even the best episode until the next one as the license shamelessly reiterates its successes and adds minor tweaks here and there. This results in a game as addictive as ever allowing for a great deal of pleasure. In this respect, the Mexico map is a devilishly efficient playground, both for the variety of its landscapes and for the tracks that have been devised on it. We drive, we explore, we marvel while time passes quickly, as quickly as the scenery passes by at an improbable pace without anything really slowing us down. This pretty much embodies what the series has become for the Xbox brand since this opus will undoubtedly be praised by the public and reviewers. Hopefully, it’ll go down that road.","At its core, Forza Horizon 5 is about having fun behind the wheel. It’s technically excellent and plays brilliantly, but it never takes itself too seriously. I mean, I jumped a pinata float off a mountain at one point. That balance makes the Horizon series the most grin-inducing racing games out there, and arguably one of the largest feathers in Xbox Game Studios’ cap.",The best arcade races nowadays. But it is becoming clear that it's getting harder and harder to move the successful formula forward.,"Forza Horizon 5 is the roadtrip holiday I’ve really needed after two years in and out of COVID-induced lockdowns. It brings me great solace to be behind the wheel, covering hundreds of kilometers of distance across an awe-inspiring piece of Earth. And even when I’m careening through the mud on a cross-country race, crashing into strangers on the internet, my mind is in an untroubled, fulfilling place. In 2021, Forza Horizon 5 is where I want to be.","Forza Horizon 5 is a marvel of a game and a standout title on the Xbox Series X. It’s a near-perfect racing and exploration game that looks stunning, plays like a dream, and just begs to be played over and over again.","Forza Horizon 5 looks phenomenal, plays well and is practically flawless. It is undoubtedly the best entry in the series and has the most detailed open world in any game to date.","Let’s be clear for a moment: Forza Horizon has always been good. From the moment it burst onto the scene in 2012 as a spin-off to the core, more po-faced Forza Motorsport series, it established itself as a fun, thrilling, and subversively moreish alternative thread for racing on Xbox. It was in many ways the spiritual, open-world successor to Project Gotham Racing, and in turn traced its roots back to arcade racing royalty like OutRun. This is a tough lineage to stand up to, but Horizon 5 takes all that history and experience and runs with it, incrementally upgrading this series into must-play brilliance. It’s an achievement of a game.","It’s always a difficult task to raise the bar on something that’s already top notch, and when it comes to the racing games, due to the natural limits of the genre, the task gets even harder. But thanks to the now more mature than ever PlayGround studio, Forza Horizon 5 crushes its own bar and reaches a whole new level, easily becoming one of the best and most complete racing games of all time, if not THE best.","I went into Forza Horizon 5 expecting a pretty racing game. What I got was an experience, a splendid open-world car exploration simulator with light RPG elements and a trunk full of things to do and see. While I’d like to see Playground try something new or perhaps break free from the existing formula next time, this is a clear candidate for 2021’s best game and a must-play, whether you have Game Pass or not.",Forza Horizon 5 features all the content from the previous game and bumps the fun of this Horizon title. The game looks stunning and the gameplay is the same casual fun of Forza Horizon. The replayability of this game makes it outstanding and deserving of a perfect score.,"Forza Horizon 5 is indeed the FAST & FURIOUSLY good and if you’re looking for a true next-gen racer, it’s finally arrived! And like Dom Toretto, Forza Horizon 5 lets you live your virtual life at a quarter mile at a time.","Forza Horizon 5 accomplishes that which so many franchises try again, and again, but fail to do so: get better with each and every entry. Playground Games and Turn 10 Studio's magnificent display brings about one of the best racing games of all time to Microsoft. Is this 2021's GOTY?","Overall, this is a Forza Horizon game in every sense of the word, and shows off the best of what Horizon can be. It’s fun, only structured if you want it to be, and seems to exist purely to make sure you have a good time. What more could you want?",History repeats itself as Playground Games once again delivers one of the best open world racers you'll ever play.,"Forza Horizon 5 sets a new industry gold standard for racing game visuals, gameplay, and map design. Our expectations of map design just leveled up with Horizon 5, and it’s another massive victory for Game Pass members who will get it on release day. The good news for players is that there’s future DLC content to come, which will only add to what is comfortably the most exciting next-gen racing game released so far.","Collectively, Forza Horizon 5 does everything right, and in doing so makes Playground Games’ latest entry into the Forza franchise an absolute must-play for any racing enthusiast or casual racing fan.","Forza Horizon 5 is a stunning and beautifully crafted entry in the series that's full of memorable races, creativity, and fantastic additions.","Forza Horizon 5 is a deep and nuanced car nirvana for revheads and auto geeks to endlessly collect, tinker, and experiment. It’s also an extremely accessible buffet of racing spectacle open to everyone, from Deluxe Edition diehards to Game Pass nomads – no matter their driving skill or mechanical knowledge. It’s an occasionally goofy but always earnest Valentine to Mexico’s world-famous culture, and a romantic ode to the magic of road-tripping through postcard-perfect vacation vistas. It’s a long haul, MMO-inspired racer that’s exploding with more races, activities, and event types than can comfortably fit on some parts of the map – and yet it still always feels relaxed rather than daunting. It never locks you into something you don’t want to do and steadily rewards you for however you choose to play it. It looks beautiful, it sounds magnificent, and it is glorious to play. Yes, Forza Horizon 5 is a lot of things. Above all, however, it is the result of a racing studio at the peak of its craft and the best open-world racing game I’ve ever played.",Forza Horizon 5 proves that even the best games can get better.

Utterly essential.,"Forza Horizon 5 is a visual spectacle and a masterpiece, providing plenty to do and tons of fun to be had around every corner.","Forza Horizon 5 is not an innovation, but its excellent quality makes it one of the best racing games even if it is conservative. It's a place of speed and limit, of wildness and freedom, which makes adrenaline soar all the time.","Forza Horizon 5 takes an already-amazing series and makes it better with a grander scale, but also an increase in quality. Even in its earliest days, it’s clear that the game will have a longer shelf life than prior entries thanks to the revamping of user-generated content adding more kinds of gameplay to the mix. Having things like obstacle courses thrown in helps evoke a bit of Project Gotham Racing, while the increase in NPCs and overall world-building makes for a better overall experience. Forza Horizon 5 is a more back-to-basics game in the sense that it puts the player on an ascendable ladder and doesn’t feel aimless like the prior two games – which in hindsight, were a bit unwieldy with regards to giving the player a set path to actually enjoy its many offerings. Forza Horizon 5 is the best entry in the series yet and should only get better as time goes on and more content is added.",Forza Horizon 5 is the best open world driving game ever and one of the best in the speed genre globally. Playground Games has once again surpassed itself with a varied ‘crossover’ in which each kilometer traveled is worth its weight in fun and spectacularity.,"It's unbelievable, but Playground games has surpassed the already brilliant Forza Horizon 4 in every way and sets a new standard for the fun you can have in a racing game. Forza Horizon 5 is a must-have, even as a racing novice, and the perfect excuse to get an Xbox Series X. Viva la Mexico!","Forza Horizon 5 [is] the first killer, can’t-miss game for the current generation Xbox Series X and S consoles as well as Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription service. It’s a game that I think anyone can immediately find appealing.","Forza Horizon 5 is the best Forza yet and, not only that, but it also makes a strong case for being the best racing game period. A joyous combo of arcade racing and simulation-level depth, all wrapped up in a beautiful bow thanks to its diverse, expansive Mexico setting, this is an unmissable iteration in what is arguably gaming’s most consistently fantastic series.","Forza Horizon 5 is the pinnacle of the Playground Games series and is the new king of open world courses. To oust such a noble predecessor was not easy but the Leamington boys have further embellished the playful recipe and made the progression in Horizon Adventure clearer. In addition to the splendid expeditions around Mexico, the arrival of 360-degree editors such as Event Lab will allow the community to create wonders and expand a basic offer with few equals, both in terms of quantity and quality. Hypercars of all brands are even more enjoyable to drive and the audiovisual presentation goes to great lengths to strive for the full next-gen. While waiting to know what the future holds for us as a flagship team of the Xbox family, we can finally enjoy this monumental experience.","Forza Horizon 5 turns ""more of the same"" into a mark of true excellence, furtherly polishing and improving on a winning formula and making it exponentially more spectacular on a technical level and more enveloping on an environmental level, and mixing it all with its distinctive driving model, a unique mix of a simulative superstructure with an arcade heart beating beneath the hood.","At every turn, Forza Horizon 5 impresses in ways few games have. From the first mile, I was on the edge of my seat. With so much to do in such a relentlessly gorgeous world, I suspect it won’t be long before I get the itch to jump back into the driver’s seat of my favorite car. Even amidst a competitive racing field, Forza Horizon 5 is a finely tuned supercar.","We can't turn a blind eye to the sporadically unfair AI, but that is also the only genuinely bad thing we have to say about Forza Horizon 5, a phenomenal racing game that excels on almost every front which makes this one of the best race games to date. This is a must have: a love letter to racing and pure, unadulterated fun.","If you're looking for an arcade racing game with an enormous amount of races, an awesome multiplayer, a lot of things to find and collect, and amazing graphics, you have finally found it!","Though it’s iterative in a lot of ways, Forza Horizon 5 is a near-faultless open-world racing experience that’s so sure of itself and its offerings that it goes the extra mile to sprinkle in the kinds of fan service that people go wild for. As a game it’s tremendous, but it’s also a brilliant, interactive postcard for a culture that is passionate about few things more than their country and their cars.","Its stunning visuals, huge content and fun multiplayer ideas prove that Forza Horizon 5 is the most enjoyable racing game of all time.","Forza Horizon 5 is the ""best of"" all the series entries. Playground Games found the key to present the ginormous amount of content in a smooth way in one of the best open worlds ever made. Mexico is a magical, fascinating and adventurous place to drive in, and the glorious graphics of the game give us the real next gen experience we were looking for.","Following to the letter its own formula in terms of gameplay, controls, structure and open world design, Forza Horizon 5 becomes the new pinnacle of the franchise due to the special way that it transports us to the beautiful Mexican landscapes, taking harnessing all the power of the Xbox Series X to become one of the first games of this new generation that undoubtedly feels like a new generation. Some rough edges at the level and interface and progression slow it down from true perfection, but its virtues overshadow those flaws and of course, make it one of the best games of this 2021.","Forza Horizon 5 is an incredible step forward for the series: with a plethora of brand new missions and challenges, and brilliant ideas to represent a colourful nation through eleven diverse biomes, Playground Games reaches new heights and shows the real face of the new generation of consoles.","Forza Horizon 5 is one of the best games of the year and starts the discussion on whether a racing title like this one could be GOTY. It stands out from the rest of similar games, both in terms of technical and gameplay aspects.","This one's for the fast and the curious. Whiplash or no, brace yourself. [Issue#366, p.100]","After four previous tours, there’s certainly a feeling of familiarity that can lessen its impact at times, and hopefully the online issues will stabilize soon. Forza Horizon 5 is less of a leap forward than its predecessor, for sure, but that doesn’t stop it from delivering an impeccably crafted world with a staggering number of fantastic things to do and jaw-dropping places to see. As much as it’s a racing game, it’s also a driving adventure. It balances chaos and precision, exploration and speed, and it gets our wholehearted recommendation for anyone who wants to get behind the wheel.","Forza Horizon 5 offers more of everything we loved with part four. The competitions are crazier and the exploration more dynamic than ever before. Some elements do seem to go on repeat, but still manage to feel fresh thanks to the environmental change. An adrenaline-filled experience no one should miss, quite simply.","After 5 games with build-up, we are left with a staggeringly good game that delivers both quality and entertainment beyond all expectations. It is both big, beautiful, varied and very, very fun.",Quotation forthcoming.,"There’s a sense of unfettered joy in everything here. It’s a game that just wants to be fun. For everyone. It aims for every moment you spend with it — be it five minutes or five hours — to be a frustration-free, jaw-dropping, reward-filled delight. And in this endeavour it succeeds marvellously. If there was ever a racing game that needs to be in every Xbox owner’s library, Forza Horizon 5 is it.","You absolutely can't go wrong with what is easily one of the most impressive open-worlds in gaming. Whether you plan on staying for a week, or hanging on for dear life for years to come, Forza Horizon 5 has more than enough to keep you busy and smiling across jungles, deserts and active volcanos.","The best in the series so far, that embraces the open world approach in a way previous entries never quite did – while also being an endlessly enjoyable and highly varied arcade racer.","Forza Horizon 5 is a monument to freedom, adrenaline and arcade fun, in a Mexico whose dimension is rivaled by its breath-taking beauty. With hundreds of cars, dozens of events and an immaculate driving experience, it's by far the best arcade racing game of the year, with a surprising depth that might even surprise the sim racing purists.",Forza Horizon 5 once again demonstrates Playground's mastery with an Xbox and PC exclusive that sets a new technological standard in the genre.,"With Forza Horizon 5, Playground doesn't shake up its arcade racing formula, but when it works so well, why change? Especially since Mexico in this episode offers undoubtedly the best map of the series, with an amazing variety of biomes and an attention to detail that borders on respect, especially on such a massive playing surface. FH5 is a title that manages to do everything it does with its hands in its pockets. Its also one of the most beautiful games of the current generation.","The new Forza Horizon is here, but the word ""new"" must be handled with care. For the most part, the fifth part is the same as the fourth. The content has just swelled in all aspects, the career has deepened its storytelling and fans of multiplayer and shared experiences have even more options to get rid of it. This is the fullest part ever with the potential to entertain you for years to come, and since the four are among the best racing games of all time, its slight evolution can't be any different.","Forza Horizon 5 absolutely lives up to the pedigree established by its predecessors. By using almost everything that worked in FH4, the game would've been a strong contender even if all it did was change its locale. The few changes in FH5 work heavily in its favor and contribute positively to the idea that the game is difficult to put down because it's fun and there's so much to do. For those who have played previous entries in the series, jump on this one immediately. For series newcomers, FH5 is a perfect place to start.",Forza Horizon 5 is a solid bet from the beginning and a visual delight for Xbox Series X.,"Forza Horizon 5 is flashy and vibrant. It packs in pretty much everything one could want out of a racing game, with a broad selection of cars, tracks, and challenges to complete. Its addition to Xbox Game Pass alone should be reason enough to try it, but it stands as one of the best Xbox exclusives out right now regardless. It might not do much to separate itself from the other entries mechanically, but Forza Horizon 5 is the best the series has felt yet.","Forza Horizon 5 is probably the best arcade racing game of recent times, and one of the most prominent releases from this year. Even if cars is not your thing, there is plenty to love in this new Microsoft exclusive.","Forza Horizon 5 is ultimately a game in the franchise that continues to evolve in a more and more enjoyable direction, even if there is a core to the game that feels very familiar.","Forza Horizon 5 is so stacked it’s hard not to feel a little overwhelmed with options. But there’s never really a sense that you need to do any of it, or progress through a series of checklists before moving on to the next thing. And in the end this might be the genius at the heart of Horizon, you’ll want to keep moving, keep driving, simply because you want to. Because it feels right. And in creating a vast, beautiful open-world in which you can do that very thing, Playground Games lives up to its namesake.","There is a lot in here that will keep you busy for days and weeks on end, in the best way possible. This game builds on everything that already made this series such a success and leaves you inundated, in a good way, with so many activities. It’s fun to play, stunning to watch, and even while writing this all I want to do is jump straight back into it. Whether you’re a fan of racing games or not, Forza Horizon 5 is a must play, as it really is a unique experience.","From its content to the incredible beauty of its representation of Mexico, Forza Horizon 5 offers an experience true to its roots. This 5th installment is already the best racing game you can find.","Forza Horizon 5 is the epitome of the series. It remains firmly rooted on the foundations of Horizon, guarding annoying aspects for some (especially the overplayed tone of all the tracks off), but only raises everything that has already made the salt of the four opuses that have it. preceded. Beautiful to knock down the bumpers, refined to blow a hose, he is a very beautiful baby. It is (very) well on its way to being a system seller in the Xbox ecosystem and I wouldn't be surprised if bundles are coming in very quickly by the end of the year. Anyone who owns a machine capable of running it should have a taste of it.","The Horizon formula has been perfected in Forza Horizon 5. Playground Games has retained what fans loved in previous games, but also offers fine-tuned gameplay and a more diverse open world to explore. This is one of the most fun and polished games of the year, and with continued support and regular content, it has the potential to thrive well into the future.","Forza Horizon 5 caters to all skill levels and approaches, and with its staggering number of missions to complete, things to collect, and fast-paced gameplay, it's an experience that attempts many things and succeeds in all of them with style.","Forza Horizon 5 is a superb racing game. Despite these slight niggles it still manages to put a beaming smile on my face every time I go hurtling off a danger sign, masterfully overtake the leader of a race to snatch the victory, or perfect a drift. It's easily one of the best-looking games on the Xbox Series X, and its extensive roster of cars and events will ensure it's engine keeps quietly ticking over for months on end.","There may not be much new in Forza Horizon 5 beyond its location, but that doesn't stop it from being yet another action-packed, adrenaline-fuelled open world racing extravaganza. This is the biggest and best entry in the Forza Horizon series yet; it's just lacking that spark of originality that has made each entry prior a clear step up from the one before it. But for the huge majority of players that really won't be an issue. Forza Horizon 4 raised the bar to an impressive height, and Forza Horizon 5 nudges it that bit higher. It's hard to imagine how Playground Games will raise it substantially in a future Forza Horizon entry, but let's hope it does find some magic, or the formula might become a little bit stale.","Forza Horizon 5 is another meaningful evolution of the series as opposed to a reinvention, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a case of more of the same. Even when it is familiar, Forza Horizon 5 makes small, but thoughtful changes to its established blueprint that hones in on the people behind the cars in a way that the franchise has previously just glossed over. It's not going to convince you to give it a go if Forza Horizon's brand of racing hasn't done it for you in the past, but Forza Horizon 5 still stands head and shoulders above anything else in the genre.","A lot of Forza Horizon 5 feels similar to Forza Horizon 4 in a way previous Horizon games haven’t felt with their prequels, but Adventures bring unique storytelling and slight edutainment to the Horizon formula and if more Horizon’s are in the future, particularly ones not in Europe and America, it’s not a bad foundation to build on. Driving feels as good as it ever has and Playground Games absolutely succeeded in interpreting the beauty of Mexico. The seasonal model returns and it does a better job of incentivizing people to group up, but it’s still not quite enough to entice people to do activities like Forza Arcade.","After five episodes, Playground Games clearly mastered the Forza Horizon formula to the perfection. In both substance and form, the success is total. The game even deploys enough assets to convince beyond car lovers, because the adventure mode offers features that remind us the structure of an action-RPG than of a classic racing game.","Nothing revolutionary in this Forza Horizon 5 but what a pleasure and what generosity. The vistas and ambiance of this Playground Games experience are incredible and provide perfect moments whether for real pilots or less comfortable players, as the game is very accessible…The activities are varied, the landscapes sublime and the sensations at the rendezvous at the wheel of the various vehicles. A delight!","Forza Horizon 5 takes what we’ve loved over the series’ life so far and brings it full circle, with a comprehensive package that includes everything you could possibly want from a racing game. Mexico is an astounding and wonderful location to explore, and production values are on point, from the stunning visuals of its gorgeous open world to the well-executed audio that keeps energy levels high. On top of the diverse range of events we’ve come to expect, Horizon Adventures adds another fun layer of story and player progression that keeps you engaged, and the vehicle handling is, still, second-to-none. With more content than ever before, the Eventlab to make even more experiences and a suite of multiplayer modes to engage with, Forza Horizon 5 is the best racing game available today, bar none.","Playground Games found so many ways to make Mexico come to life, taking great advantage of the region's diversity, while also pushing the Xbox Series X hardware to its limits. If you own the console, you owe it to yourself to check out Forza Horizon 5, whether that means purchasing a copy of the game, or playing it through Xbox Game Pass. It just might be one of the best showpieces for the next-gen era thus far.","Forza Horizon remains the king of arcade racing games, thanks to a lot of driving fun, but also a lot of well-known things.","Forza Horizon 5 improves over its predecessor in almost every way, except that some of its main events aren't as entertaining or spectacular. This is not only a love letter to its Mexican fans, but also a great contender to Game of the Year, because anyone, no matter where they are from, will be able to enjoy this great driving experience.","Forza Horizon 5 is once again beautiful, layered, versatile and unique.","It would be foolish of me to say that Forza Horizon 5 is the best game in the series given my very limited knowledge of its history. However, I can say with confidence this is the most fun I’ve had with a racing game that doesn’t involve a plumber and a princess. There is just so much to do and so much to see that I can easily lose hours of my day exploring all it has to offer. And with continued support from the developers and community, I’ll have no reason to stop playing anytime soon.","Forza Horizon 5 offers plenty to do and see in Mexico, though much of it is becoming rather familiar. The latest entry doesn't have as much impact or innovation as each of its predecessors did, but it remains the most enjoyable and customizable arcade racer around.","Forza Horizon 5 still offers great open world racing fun, looks great and establishes a dimension of freedom in progress that is unique for the genre. But at its core, the game delivers the same mechanics, the same kind of events, just a little bit differently. These wear marks don't make Forza Horizon 5 a bad game, but they make it less appealing.","It’s safe to say that Playground Games have delivered something special with Forza Horizon 5 – and as far as I’m concerned, this is currently the best driving game out there.","Forza takes its racing and cars very seriously --with painstaking attention to torque, road conditions and more tuning options than you can shake a gearstick at-- but its raison d’etre is unbridled, uncomplicated driving joy. There is a bewildering amount of stuff that populates the map: traditional races, cross-country sprints, off-road adventures, speed traps, jumps, multiplayer challenges, weekly events. You can barely drive a few yards without something to take part in or smash through. It is bewildering at first and can feel unstructured and scattergun, particularly when the game is throwing XP and rewards at you with so much abandon it's hard to keep track of it all.","An incredible open-world racer that has all the high-octane action you’d possibly want, but a reliance on previous successes makes the game feels somewhat derivative. Whether you should play this or Forza Horizon 4 is literally as much of a coin-flip on which map you’d prefer, and for me, Mexico didn’t hold the charm of flying through the Glenfinnan Viaduct.",Forza Horizon 5 doubles down on the series' winning formula to give players another hit racing game superpowered by next-gen tech.,"It may well be more of the same, but Mexico beckons, ravishing the eye and devouring up the miles.","You could spend months in Forza Horizon 5 on a coast-to-coast trip, or dip in for a few days to see the sights and admire the sunsets. The vast array of fun on offer means that whatever you do, wherever you end up, you’ll have a very good time.","Horizon 5 is one of the most technically sound games I have played this year, but it definitely feels lacking in the evolution department.",I can't tell a lug nut from a spark plug. But Forza Horizon 5's world is so beautiful that I'm more willing to play and learn just so I can continue existing in its dazzling vistas.,"It can’t match Forza Horizon 4 in terms of innovations, but Forza Horizon 5 introduces a more varied open-world structure in one of the most visually stunning experiences of this new console generation — perhaps ever.","FH5 is an easy recommendation as part of a paid Xbox Game Pass subscription, and it's a great excuse to flex your newest gaming hardware purchase. But if you're already happy with Forza Horizon 4 or were bored by that one, take your sweet time sitting behind this game's wheel.","Ultimately, Horizon 5 doesn’t really care how you play provided you’re having a good time; the fact that you can race any event in any car should be evidence enough of that. And it delivers you enough cars and event variety that you’re never really agonising over minor incidental perks. There’s as much fun to be had driving a LaFerrari here as a Mercedes A-Class, or a shitty little jeep. It’s about sunshine and sights and sounds and freedom. Don Draper once mused that happiness is a moment before you need more happiness. Horizon 5 is constantly delivering those addictive micro-doses and it’s why I never want to leave.","Playground Games delivers yet another gorgeous and enveloping pocket holiday, smartly restructured but reassuringly unchanged. [Eurogamer Recommended]","If all this sounds a lot like Forza Horizon 4 and Forza Horizon 3 and so on, yeah, okay. So what? Sure, Forza Horizon 5 doesn’t reinvent the wheel. It doesn’t need to. Forza Horizon 5 is constant rise. It’s 138 bpm. It’s uncut MDMA (or so I’ve heard). There are few true thrills in gaming that come without a catch, and Forza’s core is still, all these years later, one of them: It feels genuinely fantastic to be on the open road, zooming toward the horizon with nothing on your mind other than the pulsing beat of a killer song, and the unburdened knowledge that you can keep going as long as you want, with no one and nothing around to tell you otherwise.","Even now, though, I can feel myself tightening up in my shoulders and chest thinking about everything in Forza Horizon 5, and the difference between everything I have — with a V sound — and everything I have — F sound — to do. It’s the difference between opportunities and obligations. The only area in which Forza Horizon 5 stumbles is when it gives me so much of the former that they become the latter. [Recommended]","Forza Horizon 5 is just another Forza Horizon, yes, but it’s a beautiful one with an incredible setting, and that’s enough to make it the best in the series. If you have any interest whatsoever in driving fast cars fast, I highly recommend it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rogue-legacy-2,,,,"What you're left with is a sequel that players are more likely to stick with, which makes them more likely to appreciate all the other bells and whistles, story aspects, cool bosses and upgrades that have also been packed in here. Yes, Rogue Legacy 2 doesn't fully escape from the repetition and inherently grindy nature of its genre but, in giving players more agency and control over how difficult things are, it's evolved from a somewhat frustrating - and very often rage-inducing - experience into a far more chilled and, in turn, addictive roguelite that we're genuinely having quite a lot of trouble putting down. This one's up there with the very best we've played so far this year.",Rogue Legacy 2 is a fun game that incentivises variety. The different character traits can come together and make truly unique runs that don’t feel repetitive.,,,,,,,,"Rogue Legacy 2 doesn't revolutionize the saga but expands and improves every part of it, adding great variety and many options for the players. This will keep it a constant presence in your hard drives for many months.",,,,,"Addictive, varied, precise, coherent, relevant, Rogue Legacy 2 serves as the ideal sequel to the cult 2013 game that popularized rogue-lite. But more than doing better on absolutely every level (classes, weapons, traits), the Cellar Door Games studio is setting a new benchmark in the genre thanks to a clever mix of metroidvania and randomly generated levels. It's simple, the whole thing works like hell. Never frustrating, always giving the feeling of moving forward, constantly reviving the pleasure of the game with different powers and heroes to embody, Rogue Legacy 2 returns and marks the rogue-lite with a red iron. One of the best games of 2022.","Rogue Legacy 2 is phenomenal. It’s as amusing as its predecessor, but it evolves past those fantastic foundations. If you love the original or the genre, you’ll adore this.",,"Rogue Legacy 2 is excellent in every conceivable metric. The gameplay is fast, tight, and feels fair. It’s simplistic but beautiful graphically. The music is excellent, and the story is intriguing but not in the way.",,,"Sadly, I don’t have a Steam Deck. (Note to self: somehow obtain a Steam Deck.) But I do have Rogue Legacy 2, and I can say that even if it’s not portable on the Xbox, it’s still every bit as fun as it was the first time around.",,,,,,,"Similarly to its predecessor, Rogue Legacy 2 promptly joins the closed circle of roguelite classics such as The Binding of Isaac (2011), Dead Cells (2017), Hades (2018) or the more recent Returnal (2021). Although we already know the mechanics it proposes, it is hard to criticise the title’s foundations as its gameplay seems to be bountiful and mastered. Thanks to quick succession of games and numerous surprises, one quickly ends up piling up dozens of hours, which is truly and undoubtedly the mark of the greats and tokens of a delightful gaming experience.","Rogue Legacy essentially spawned the roguelite genre and nine years later, its sequel improves the recipe in every way. Rogue Legacy 2 looks fantastic and plays even better, with engaging mechanics and an addictive gameplay loop. While you might not always make progress, you also never feel bored or that the game disrespects your time. Every run is a new experience and often surprising. There are a lot of systems at play, but they generally help Rogue Legacy 2 transcend the limits of the genre and make it endlessly replayable and entertaining.",,"Rogue Legacy 2 is the perfect sequel. It retains the core of what made the original fantastic, with every feature adding tremendously to the experience.

Add to the mix new challenges, more complex traversal mechanics and more ways than ever to upgrade your character, and you’ve got a winning formula.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rogue Legacy 2 is simply one of the best indie games ever.

persona-4-golden,,,,"It's the best version of an already fantastic game, a game that's aged superbly well for the most part, and one that arrives on Xbox Game Pass with high resolution visuals, a quick save function, gallery mode and the ability to select your difficulty from the get-go. If you've yet to sample the deep delights of Persona 4, we really can't recommend it enough - it's perhaps our favourite entry in the franchise, doing so much that Persona 5 does but without that game's sometimes unnecessary bloat.

The title sports commendable optimizations on console and maintains solid performance, especially as a title reputable for pushing the best PC hardware out there.

I can’t think of a better time for the sort of freedom it provides. If you have an Xbox Series X, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.",,,,,,"The console adaptation of Microsoft Flight Simulator is as good as it could be. Few concessions were observed to make it run on Xbox Series. Obviously, some of the interfaces are quite difficult to apprehend with a controller, but one has to acknowledge that it would’ve been difficult to do otherwise even if we still secretly hope that a few updates will enhance that aspect. As it is, the game is an exceptional experience of fullness for whoever enjoys watching gorgeous sceneries while the others can train and hone their piloting skills with a controller or with other devices. As it is included in the Xbox Game Pass, you simply have to try it at least once to discover the amazing features of this flight simulator.","Microsoft Flight Simulator is not without its faults. The user interface is hardly user-friendly, opting for a simple recreation of the PC version without much thought given to console gaming.

This is an ambitious game that really should be restricted to high-end PCs, but Asobo Studio has defied the odds to craft a well optimised console version that delivers the full simulation experience. If you want a punishingly accurate simulation of flying a passenger jet, while that remains fully intact on Xbox, Flight Simulator is best suited to a keyboard and mouse with a monitor. But if you prefer to relax and experience the joy of flying anywhere around the world, without having to worry about how your hardware will manage such an ambitious project, Flight Simulator on Xbox Series X and S is marvel to behold.

It may not appeal to every gamer due to its structure but deserves to be played even once by all Xbox Game Pass subscribers.",,,,"The Xbox Series X version of Microsoft Flight Simulator works best if you look at it as the closest approximation that anyone could get to a sophisticated flight simulator without a beefy PC. The cracks start to show when you check the ground for details, and the frame rate could be better, but it remains a stunning game that showcases the system's power. The controls remain technical enough to scare away the easily intimidated, but the number of tutorials and assists ensure that you can get into the air with ease — even if getting back on the ground can be a challenge. It does well in its promise to let players see the world from above, and if you have the patience to deal with a byzantine menu system and don't want to fire off any missiles, you'll enjoy the countless hours you can spend with Microsoft Flight Simulator.",,,"What we're left with is the fact that Microsoft Flight Simulator is a truly unique game.

[Eurogamer Essential],,,"If anything, the Xbox version can feel a little too close to the PC version at times, with an occasionally clunky cursor-driven interface. It’s a little conspicuous to have a graphic settings menu where the only option is to turn HDR on and off, for example. But it’s better to leave too much in than to cut too much out: what matters is that the flying experience is as good as it could be given the hardware on hand. From what I’ve played of Microsoft Flight Simulator on the Xbox Series X, I don’t feel like Asobo has left much on the table. It’s still an incredible technical achievement, and one well worth checking out when it hits Game Pass tomorrow.",,,"First of all, it’s amazing what the developers managed to achieve with a game that made even the most expensive PC graphics cards sweat. The landscapes and cities look simply breathtaking on Xbox Series X, and the console doesn’t get red-hot. However, I did encounter some technical issues, like vanishing textures or even a sudden crash back to the main menu. I’m also not a fan of keeping the interface identical to the PC version, because it means sometimes you need to use your controller as a poor substitute for a mouse.

But even non-fans will find it a very enjoyable RPG experience, with very few bugs, majestic graphical detail and a well-balanced difficulty.","Hogwarts Legacy is not only the best game ever made of the Harry Potter franchise, but it is also a fantastic RPG. The title, developed by Avalanche, wastes a lot of care for the magical world, but it is also consistent in all its playable elements. If we add to this that we will have a spectacular graphics, as well as music that captures the essence of the saga, Hogwarts Legacy is a must for every fan of the boy who survived.","Hogwarts Legacy is a magical experience that is bound to go down well with fans of the Wizarding World.

Hogwarts Legacy is definitely the game all Harry Potter fans have been waiting for. Beautiful, lively, exhilarating and surprising, it drips with passion and magic and is a real pleasure to browse.

With its very good ideas, its world just waiting to be explored, its art direction to die for and its combat system as addictive as it is magical, it is quite simply an excellent action and adventure game. We would have liked choices with more impact or a proposal a little off the beaten track. As you will have understood, there are many things to say about Hogwarts Legacy. But to leave you the surprise, we let you discover the magic of this game which will very clearly mark the year 2023.

It’s certainly weighed down by technical issues, a lackluster main story, and some poor enemy variety, but even those couldn’t come close to breaking its enchanting spell over me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hogwarts Legacy is far from a bad game. It's a great gift to everyone who adores Harry Potter series, and can enjoy Ubisoft-style gameplay structure.

But the games presentation of its choices; in making them seem dire and dare I say ‘world shattering’ only to then have them add up to a big fat pile of nothing in the post-narrative game is just a cop out that sucks.

Those magical moments of flying on a hippogriff, seeing the sun set behind Hogwarts and snow falling from the ceiling in the Great Hall will be etched in your memory.","I can easily recommend this to all Harry Potter fans, and even to those who are only slightly interested in his world.

Its unique structure and sheer scope, coupled with the signature Arkane gameplay that has been polished to within an inch of its life, feels like the work of a developer finally fully realizing a vision that began many years ago with the original Dishonored.",,,,,,"Even one year after its initial release, Deathloop still is a one of a kind videogame that must be played. One needs to experience it first-hand to truly understand the ingenuity behind its intense gameplay with many different approaches, its exemplary level design and its spectacular art direction. Deathloop is not only an original concept (one that is assumed from start to finish), it is above all one of the best narrative FPS of the last few years. The concept “made in Arkane” is pushed to its paroxysm and it is probably one of the best immersive sim we ever played. Its arrival in the Game Pass will undoubtedly give it extra visibility and we hope it will receive the credit it deserves for all of its content and not just for what it could have been. We have waited a year for it, and now it is here: Deathloop is finally back home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arkane Studios' shooter is finally available on Xbox Series consoles with a large new update, but it's still very much the same middling experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Deathloop delivers an astonishing experience also on Xbox Series X, involving us in an original and exciting, brilliantly narrated adventure. A very valuable addition to the Xbox Game Pass catalog for a game full of surprises.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Deathloop’s debut on the Xbox Series X is equally as good as it was on the PlayStation 5. You get the same great story and the same perfect gameplay experience. Choose one and enjoy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it-takes-two,,"It Takes Two is a game that all gamers should play. The co-op only aspect could turn some people away, but they make it very easy to play the game with others. You can play split-screen locally or online with anyone on your friends list even if they don’t own the game. And the co-op gameplay is what really makes the game shine, the expertly crafted levels are so much fun to explore, traverse, and complete. The seemingly never-ending flow of new mechanics makes the game feel fresh and makes playing as each character a unique experience. Hazelight Studio seems to have mastered the art of making co-op games, each game they create gets better and better. I can’t wait to see what they’re planning next.",,"It Takes Two is an absolute delight. The consistently creative gameplay is on par with, if not better than any co-op experience available on Xbox today, and if you have a partner in mind to play it with (don't forget they can access a free ""Friend's Pass"" if playing online), we think you'll have a real blast with it. We had such a great time playing through its highly memorable adventure, and you know what? We feel like the constant laughter, enjoyment and need for collaborative teamwork even reinvigorated our real life relationship a little bit. That's how good this game is.","It’s wonderful to see a studio master their craft, and produce the stone-cold classic that represents everything that they’re trying to achieve. Josef Fares and his team at Hazelight have been noisily making the case for cooperative experiences for some time now, and with It Takes Two on the Xbox it feels like they’ve been vindicated. Find someone else to jump onto this roller coaster with - a loved one if you can - as it’s an experience you will want to talk about and share repeatedly. Now, let’s just hope it opens the door to more games like it.","It Takes Two is the magnum opus not only of Hazelight Studios but of co-op experiences in general. It’s one of those extremely rare games that it’s almost impossible to find a fault to any of its elements, be it the longevity, gameplay, art direction, music, boss fights, environmental puzzles, innovation etc. A truly flawless experience.","It Takes Two once again reinvents the co-op genre, a fun and exciting adventure to play with a loved one and stop and think about ourselves.","It Takes Two is an incredible cooperative adventure that surprises us over and over again. Beautiful, charming, and wrapped in deceivingly childish story, it’s a game you need to play.","It Takes Two is a great rom-com romp filled with action, oodles of variety, and more than a few twists and turns. No, you won't like Cody and May for much of the game, and some segments do feel a touch drawn out, but grab the right co-op buddy and this is a hoot.","While the game's creativity shines in its beat-by-beat gameplay and level design, It Takes Two's selling point — its narrative — feels half-baked.",,,"A co-op adventure of the highest quality, It Takes Two masterfully blends storytelling, visuals and gameplay to create something unique. Hazelight Studios' second work amuses, entertains, stimulates, excites and makes us think, without ever boring the players and avoiding any errors. If you like co-op experiences, May and Cody's story is really unmissable.",,,,"A game that provides a healthy dollop of pathos with its co-operative fun, It Takes Two is an unadulterated shot of joy brimming with inventive puzzles and smart ideas. Sure, some of its metaphors for the breakdown happening in May and Cody's relationship might be a little heavy-handed, but there's so much to love here that it's hard to care about such trifles. It Takes Two is a breath of fresh air and total.","It is enchanting, funny and terribly refreshing.",,"It Takes Two is a wonderful fairy tale about love and relationships, where fun is guaranteed by Fares' creativity finally free to explore many different genres.",,,,,,,,"An outstanding adventure that is completely unique and offers the widest variety of activities for a two player coop game ever made. And above that tells a story that matters and is linked to the gameplay itself in a marvelous way. The only letdown of It Takes Two is not having someone to play it, cos' is an extraordinary experience.","It Takes Two is thus far one of the year’s best platformers, best overall games, and can likely stake a claim as one of the best co-op games ever created. It merges a grand platforming adventure with sublime co-op play through a blend of perfectly-crafted challenges and jaw-dropping levels and setpieces that you need to share with someone close to you. It’s a triumph in almost every area, with such a wide range of expertly-executed ideas and gameplay concepts that it deserves to be called a true passion project in almost every sense of the word. You need to experience this as soon as you can, so grab a friend and prepare to be wowed.",,,,,,,,"Honestly, It Takes Two is one of the most pleasant surprises in video games I’ve ever had. I went in more or less expecting a fairly gimmick-laden brief but fun escapade, but it’s so much more than that. This is a game that I would recommend to anyone who longs for the kind of no-holds-barred childlike fantasy so common in the 80s but seems less common today. If that is you, don’t sleep on this real gem.","It Takes Two can be considered one of the best games in the history of Co-Op genre, one that takes it above and beyond video games, animations and even Hollywood movies in terms of emotional relationships.","It Takes Two is the culmination of a decade of novel co op gaming ideas, and that makes it one of 2021's best games no matter what else comes out.",,,,"It Takes Two wears a lot of hats, and each of them well. It's a romantic comedy, a challenging shooter, a head-scratching puzzler and more.",,,,,"It Takes Two is a spectacular co-op adventure that lays down a path of great gameplay ideas and uses it to play a giddy game of hopscotch. It’s beautiful, breakneck-paced, and bubbling over with creativity, and playfulness and experimentation are rewarded at every turn. If you have any kind of co-op partner in your life, be they spouse, friend, sibling, or other (even a child, though the themes might be too mature for them), It Takes Two is a truly joyful trip you really need to take together.",,,"It Takes Two is without a doubt one of the best platformers I've played in the last decade. The level design is incredible, and the amount of ideas in terms of its co-operative elements make every second of it so much fun to play.",,,"It Takes Two is a brilliant coop platform game, in which every level is designed as a collaborative puzzle. It is fun, sometimes moving, and every level shows great ingenuity.",,,,,,"It Takes Two may not be the platforming juggernaut that it aspires to be, but it more than makes up for it with its big heart, wealth in variety, and gorgeous imagery. All of its individual actions are things we’ve done in other games, but when applied to this distinct cooperative approach, they take on a whole new life and are used in wonderful ways over a long adventure. The action will have you laughing and screaming at your TV, and the story stays strong throughout, creating the backbone for an entertaining adventure that roars with excitement and should keep you glued to the controller to see if this couple’s lost love can be rekindled.",,,,"It Takes Two brings us all gameplay elements that are desired in a co-op game, Team Hazelight has indeed achieved a next level experience in a journey filled with a lot of excitement.",,,,,,,,,,,"After the enjoyable, but often intense, A Way Out, It Takes Two is a confident next step for Hazelight Studios. Varied and ambitious in scope, it's the culmination of what Josef Fares began with Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons back in 2013, and in these bizarre times it's a perfect antidote to a world currently devoid of physical connection. Don't be fooled by the impermanence of its mechanics - the story and characters will stay with you long after you and your friend log off, and you may just feel a little closer, too.",,,,,,,,,,,"The story that revolves around the divorce of Cody and May feels, well, a little divorced from the vibrant co-op platformer that makes up the bulk of It Takes Two. Where new and exciting fantasy locations and interesting mechanics are introduced regularly with a story that fails to keep pace or even reach a satisfying conclusion.","All in all, It Takes Two is a wonderful two-player experience, with plenty to immerse you and your co-op partner in for hours on end, whether that be at home or online. Hazelight have worked wonders in the co-op genre yet again here - but with that said, there are still a few moments of annoyance along the way. But if you fall in love with Cody and May early on, you'll quite easily see past this. It Takes Two welcomes both non-gamers and gamers to join in the fun together, and ultimately learn the relatable reality behind that title.",Josef Fares and his team at Hazelight Studios stayed faithful to their vision of a collaborative and sharing gaming experience and It Takes Two is a Tour de Force on this particular aspect. The constant renewal of gameplay is mindblowing and makes for an enriching and playful experience that no one should miss.,,,,,,"It's impressive stuff. It Takes Two is the best 3D platformer I've played since Super Mario Odyssey, and like that game, it has a flair for variety. You may ride a frog or fly a plane with wings made from Cody's boxers or hack-and-slash through a Diablo-style castle. Despite the downright wild amount of things to do, It Takes Two manages to handle every mechanic well. This is the second release from Hazelight, and while A Way Out had plenty of fans, it seems that it may just take two to make a thing go quite this right.",,,,,,,"The real value behind It Takes Two comes from its strong gameplay mechanics that create one of the best co-op experiences in the recent generation of video games. Thanks to its solid level design that adds new and simple mechanics constantly, we have a game that anyone can enjoy.",,,,,,,,,,The skilful combination of game conventions and fresh ideas is the real marriage at the heart of this unusual adventure.,,,,,,"If you can ignore the story, It Takes Two has some of the best co-op gameplay in years. [Eurogamer Recommended]",,"Most big-budget games could use an editor to trim away the unnecessary bits that seem to exist to pad the length of the adventure and justify the price on the box. It Takes Two would benefit from a similar trim, requiring a more experienced writer to fix the weak narrative and dialogue, alongside a producer to make the tough choices of which segments of the game are fun versus those that are downright dull. Without that edit, the game feels unbalanced, like a solo performed by a singer going on one too many runs, unaware that the audience has shifted from entertained to annoyed.",,,,,"It's probably the best videogame created by Josef Fares. A cooperative experience like no other, that pushes you to collaborate with other person in order to complete very imaginative situations. The variety is spectacular and the narrative very fun to follow. The coop-adventure definitive experience. [Recommended]",,,,,,,"It Takes Two is simply an amazing co-op game. When played together with a good friend, it will become an experience you won’t soon forget.","Despite a shaky allegorical narrative that's much shallower and less mature than it first appears, It Takes Two is an ambitious and worthwhile zany two-player experience. From high-speed ice-skating and spider-riding to co-operative school homework and fighting a clockwork bull, I honestly never knew what was coming next, but it was generally delightful and always thoughtfully tuned for co-operative play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-+-2,"Even for the biggest Tony Hawk game fans out there like myself, asking gamers to fork over a full repurchase if you happened to buy a disc version instead of digital on Xbox One is quite a steep ask, one that may put a bad taste in some mouths. The $10 upgrade fee for previous digital owners is also going to put some people off, as many games are offering the free upgrade for the Series X versions via Smart Delivery, so it's a shame to not see that here as well. That said, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 - Xbox Series X|S is absolutely worth it if you have a newer 120hz capable TV or haven't already purchased it on Xbox One, as there’s no better arcade skate game out there on the market today nor one that will play as smooth.",,,"The game itself is still absolutely great, and has added minor updates to multiplayer and the ability to replay the career since launch, which were welcome additions. It's one of the best examples of a Tony Hawk's game in over 15 years, and while the next-gen upgrade is nice, the backwards compatible Xbox One version is also still really good, so you don't need to hand over any extra cash to enjoy it.","After the release of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 on Xbox, we can definitely say that the franchise is back. After the disaster of Pro Skater 5, and the so-so remake on the Xbox 360, this is easily the compilation that brings the Tony Hawk’s franchise back into the gaming spotlight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 on the next-gen systems is the ultimate way to play this fantastic revival. Smoother, faster and more fluid, it will have you reliving your youth with a big smile on your face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 was already a fantastic remake, literally bringing the franchise back from the dead. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 Next-Gen is just the definitive edition of an outstanding project, making it worthy of those extra bucks. Besides some very minor nitpicks, like what more could be added to increase its content, the game runs, looks, and plays flawlessly, just like its predecessors.",,,,,,,,,"It's no surprise that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 is still a spectacular game. The near-perfect recreation of two of gaming's most beloved titles has been improved upon in some smart ways, utilizing the power of both the PS5 and Xbox Series X to push the image quality, resolution, and frame rate to new heights. And if the PS5 ever gets an update to add VRR support, the Performance mode will shine just as bright as it does on the Xbox Series X.",,,,,,,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 now runs at 120 FPS or 4K thanks to next-gen hardware. If you like skating games you will immediately realize that we have a winner here, but in order to see the graphical improvements, you will need a trained eye. This update has a cost, so I would only recommend it if it's the first time you dive into this remaster, if you already had the Deluxe edition or if you feel the need to start using your Xbox Series right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 pulls off one of the hardest tricks of all – providing a game that will appeal both to those who have fond memories of the original and those who are playing a skateboarding game for the first time. The controls are tight and responsive, the animations smooth and realistic, the levels are a joy to skate, and on Xbox Series X|S, the game is on a whole new level graphically. The game is a true and fitting tribute to its legacy, as well as a skating game for the new generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tetris-effect-connected,,,,,"At the end of the day, Tetris Effect: Connected on Xbox is just Tetris. It’s the game we’ve all played a million times over, it’s a game we all know like the back of our hand, and it’s a game in which we can rack up the highest of high scores with our eyes closed. And that, that feel of familiarity, is quite possibly the only thing that is holding Connected back from utter greatness. Yes this version looks great, it plays brilliantly, it sounds awesome, and it could well be the best Tetris experience yet, but at the end of the day it’s still Tetris... yet it is still as stupidly addictive as it ever was.",,I have not stopped playing this title since I had my first contact with it.,Tetris Effect evolves with fun multiplayer modes that add a new layer of fun and challenge to an already fantastic game.,"Perhaps not quite as transcendental as it is in VR, Tetris Effect: Connected remains an incredible, visionary piece of work, that you can now experience with others. With its arrival on Xbox Series X, it can be a game for a new generation.",,,,"Tetris Effect: Connected is the definitive edition of the classic puzzle game, mixing its formula with Lumines' synesthetic effect and lots of modes, including the completely new and highly engaging co-op Connected mode. A game that won't leave our consoles for many years.",,,,,"Whether alone or with others, Tetris Effect: Connected is a stunning pleasure.",,,,,,,,,,"The best Tetris game ever, with plenty of multiplayer modes and a ton of hours of playtime. It may be something that we have seen a lot of times before, but it's still awesome and extremely entertaining.",,,,,,,,,,,,,The Tetris Effect Connected is an unusual but super fun next-gen experience and an unexpected one at that!,,"Tetris Effect can be extremely relaxing, somehow easing your mind and body into a serene sense of calm; it’s fitting then that a new mechanic called the Zone capitalises on this, allowing you to slow down time and enter a state of near-nirvana. Tetris Effect can also be as stressful as hell when you’re reaching the top of your allowed play space, and that Zone mechanic will still serve the purpose of trying to remedy that. Plan your drops accordingly.","The way Tetris Effect: Connected complements its traditional yet timeless Tetris gameplay with a gorgeous, constantly evolving presentation, combined with an array of modes that now encompasses everything you can want in a Tetris package, makes it the best way to experience one of gaming’s quintessential pieces.",,,,,,An already spectacular game breaks free of its solo constraints to become the definitive Tetris experience.,,,,,,,,"Tetris Effect Connected proves once again to be a refined reinterpretation of a timeless classic, a true masterpiece that resists the passage of time without giving up, ready to conquer even the new generations.",,,,Tetris Effect: Connected is what Tetris Effect should have been in the first place: a fantastic puzzle mixed with an astonishing audiovisual experience that can now finally be shared with other players.,,,"Plain and simple, the best Tetris incarnation currently available. Now with new interesting multiplayer modes.",,,,,,,,With Connected the Resonair team delivers the puzzle piece that was missing in the original: an entertaining and fun multiplayer mode.,"This new Xbox edition keeps everything that made the original one of the best puzzlers in years (except the VR part, which it turns out is pretty unnecessary) and adds a heaping helping of multiplayer to the mix.",,"Arguably the definitive version of one of the most famous, and enduring, video games in history, with some very welcome new multiplayer features.",,,,,"I may not be seeing tetrominos during my day job, but I do have a newfound obsession with Tetris. Since starting this game, I've gone down YouTube rabbit holes learning about t-spins, tips, and tricks to improve my Tetris game. I've replayed modes to beat my previous high score, which I don't normally do in games. Even after this review, I'm eager to jump back into Journey mode to hear some of my favorite songs before booting up another title. As an added bonus, the multiplayer options make for a solid package that should offer players tons of hours of Tetris.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's a unique experience, and part of the magic of the original version. While I think multiplayer is the more approachable feature, and what I would want if forced to choose, I do wish there were a way to have both in a single package. But there's no time for regrets in Tetris. The next piece is falling and you only have a few seconds to put it in place. Then the next piece, and the one after that. Some people meditate to clear their minds. Other people cook, or build models. Tetris Effect has a similar capacity to clear your mind. In 2018, that made Tetris Effect feel special. In 2020, it feels essential.",,"Tetris Effect is back again, and it brings all the multiplayer modes along, which is a great add to the content. Sure it lacks coms between players, and you sometimes end up playing versus a bot, but overall, it's a great game, specially if you missed the original release two years ago.",,,,,,,,"Tetris Effect: Connected is the best version of one of the top releases of 2018. The multiplayer additions are all excellently designed, with Connected Mode being one of the best co-operative experiences out there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tetris Effect Connected is one big psychedelic trip that Xbox owners were previously missing out on. There is such a variety in themes, music, and game modes that it is unbelievable that developers still find a way to innovate, iterate and make, ostensibly, a puzzle game from the 1980s feel new and desirable to play. There is enough depth here in the multiplayer modes to retain the attention of Tetris players beyond the relatively short Journey and Effects modes, albeit many will chase their own tail to better their rankings and high scores. At the time of writing Tetris Effect Connected is available on Game Pass Ultimate so there is no real excuse to not give this a chance.",,,,,,"Tetris effect: Connected reaches its true potential in the extensive multiplayer modes.

immortality,,,"Immortality finds creator Sam Barlow building on the found-footage FMV framework of Her Story and Telling Lies in ambitious and surprising new ways. That boldness pays off in the frame-shifting narrative, which encompasses three meticulously crafted feature films, their creation, and the sinister truth of what happened to the woman who starred in them. But the “match cut” system you use to navigate between clips and discover new ones means the actual process of piecing together the story is messier and less satisfying than in his previous work.","Immortality is easily Sam Barlow's best game to date and, when you consider the delights he's served up previously, well, you get an idea of just how good this one really is. It's a dazzling display from any angle you to choose to admire it; top-notch acting, brilliant writing, a core mechanic that's mind-bendingly complex but carried off with style and grace, intuitive controls that draw you into your role...just remember to avoid spoilers, dive into the mystery of Marissa Marcel completely unsullied, and you're in for one of the most exquisite gaming experiences of this year, or any other, by quite some distance.","I guarantee you will have never played anything like Immortality. It’s a compelling enigma, but one I am glad to have had the privilege to soak up and enjoy.",,"Sam Barlow’s latest title is fascinating, curious and much darker than it seems.",,,"Immortality is unlike any other game. It's wildly ambitious, gorgeously shot, well acted, and incredibly unique. You might think you understand the straightforward gameplay, which requires you to match clips together to uncover the story of actress Marissa Marcel, but you have no idea what you're getting into and what you'll be at the end.",,,,,,,,"Immortality is a new demonstration of the art of Sam Barlow. Mystical, captivating, Marissa is the main subject of a work of absolutely remarkable screenplay consistency, with polished shots and whose non-chronological grouping makes the whole experience gripping. And if it is true that the redundancy of the gameplay based on a simple click mechanism can prove to be heavy at the end of the experience, the adventure is nonetheless incredibly striking and controlled.",,,"It is a triumph in the FMV game genre and one of the, if not the best gaming experiences of my lifetime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immortality ambitiously succeeds at evolving the formats introduced in Her Story and Telling Lies to offer some of Sam Barlow’s best work yet and one of gaming’s most well-justified open-world experiences. Bolstered by some fantastic performances and a compelling mystery to uncover, it’s engrossing and engaging from beginning to end. While it might assume some prior knowledge in telling it’s underlying story, Immortality is an experience that’s not to be missed and one that I’ll never stop thinking about. It is truly fantastic and well worth your time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nothing less than a whole new genre of video game, that evolves the interactive movie into something that feels dynamic and excitingly different.",,,,,,,"Ultimately, one's enjoyment of Immortality is going to depend entirely on two things: if they like art house films and if they have the patience to sift through over 200 clips of mostly-boring footage to get the story's full picture. The story itself is interesting enough that players will find themselves compelled to keep returning to the game to look for more clues, even if they're otherwise bored, but gameplay-wise, it doesn't have much to offer beyond its one genius trick. Immortality is something that everyone should at least try through Xbox Game Pass, but they should go in understanding that the game is going to demand a lot from them and not always offer much in return.",,,,,,,,"Immortality is a stunning game overall. It's a truly effective mystery that has a great understanding of the kind of story it wants to tell and the kind of topics where it wants to peel back the skin. It certainly won't be for everyone, but it's a demanding and brilliant experience for those who want something a little more cerebral.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Immortality certainly gives you that leeway for your own interpretation and enough compelling mystery that its puzzle can get under your skin and spill out of the game itself. There are already some fascinating readings of the game out there and much of the fun will come in discussion and dissection. I still don’t think I have a perfect handle on what it all means, despite reaching the game’s ‘conclusion’, but I have some ideas. What I do know is that this is a brilliantly clever, disturbing and singular piece of work.","By uncovering the mystery of Marissa Marcel through the very visual language of cinema with both intuitive and tactile controls, Immortality raises a new high bar on what’s possible with video and game mechanics. Anchored by its cast’s stellar performances, a script and production that perfectly captures the film genres and eras depicted, this is an arthouse masterpiece destined for, well, immortality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Throughout its gameplay, you are going to ask question about the game and explore the movie itself. The interesting story tells you about an immortal art and ugly reality, also an unknown phenomena time to time. However, the lack of interaction in gameplay was highlighted even more, under Sam Barlow's intention. That is why someone is talking about its perfection, while others point out its insufficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f1-2021,,"Despite Breaking Point not hitting the mark with me, F1 2021 is an exceptional game for their first entry onto the Series X consoles and will keep F1 fans happy for another year.",,,"F1 2021 is probably the most in-depth, customisable and amendable F1 racer to date, so much so that there’s little that any fan of the sport could ever really want more of. Yes, it would have been nice to see Codemasters go deeper with their Braking Point story, yet it's extremely tricky to find anything too critical of what they've produced with F1 2021. After honing their skills with some glorious F1 racing experiences over the years, once again the latest edition manages to be the finest yet and should be the go-to racer for any fanatics of the sport.",,F1 2021 brings some interesting improvements to Xbox Series that make it a serious contender for best driving game of the year.,,,,,,"F1 2021 pairs the franchise's traditional modes with the excellent story mode Braking Point, gaining additional longevity and freshness. The gameplay is well suited to both novices and experienced players, the damage management is excellent but there is room for improvement in regard to the graphics. Ultimately, a definitely recommended title.","F1 2021 is one of the best editions of the saga. It’s a solid game, with impressive graphics at 4K/60 fps and outstanding sound effects that try to transport us to a TV race. All of that is joined with a robust gameplay that adapts to every kind of player and a huge variety of game modes for single player and multiplayer.",,,"While it's a shame that classic cars have been nixed this year, F1 2021 is nonetheless an exhilarating racing game brimming with compelling modes and customisation features, as well as the new Braking Point story mode, for countless hours of wheel-to-wheel action. Another sterling effort from Codemasters, racing games don't really come much better than this.","For its first lap on the next-gen, the Codemasters F1 series manages to offer content at the level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"F1 2021 offers a fascinating immersion into the most popular category of car racing. The new scripted adventure “Braking Point” truly is successful and manages to grasp its audience’s attention for around ten hours with a thrilling storyline, captivating cinematics, and racing challenges. Adding the two-player career mode effectively pumps up the excitement and the interest in this classical race-game experience. Even though it’s a quality game with lots to offer, it must be noted that losing the retro events is puzzling and the rest of the game is a mere copy-paste of the previous title. Another drawback is that the supposed “optimisation” inherent to the Series X|S is rather disappointing, even if the technical and graphical basis of the last opuses was quite impressive already. Despite these issues, this 2021 vintage remains a fabulous, skillful, and fun experience to play: a real must-have for any F1 fan.","For anyone who has even the slightest interest in Formula 1 racing - and thanks to the Netflix documentary series Drive to Survive there may be many with their curiosity piqued - F1 2021 will become their new sports gaming pastime. Catering to both casual newcomers and the most exacting simulation-seekers, F1 2021 offers a mind-blowing amount of polished and entertaining content, whether your preference is to race alone or with others.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Much of F1 2021 builds on the high-class foundation from previous games that make the series one of the best racing games out there, but new additions, especially Braking Point, are both great pieces of content on their own and optimistic foundational pieces for the future.",,,,"F1 2021 is the best-looking and most customisable instalment of the long-running Codemasters series to date, and the ability to tinker under the hood of the core career experience and play co-op with a friend is very welcome. With the addition of Braking Point it’s also arguably the boldest F1 game so far. The characterisation is a little underdone and the E for Everyone approach means it’s quite an airbrushed take on the F1 world compared to Netflix’s tense and profanity-laden Drive to Survive, but injecting a story mode into the F1 series was a risk well worth taking and I’m certainly looking forward to more of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,F1 2021 delivers the high-octane racing everyone is used to but mixes in greater multiplayer options through two-player career and the new social online lobbies and the addition of a compelling and well-structured story mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This is the best and most attractive installment of a Formula 1 game in recent years. Codemasters has achieved this by building on a 2015 engine, but maybe in a couple of years we will see a truly next generation game that takes advantage of all the good elements that we have today. The future of the franchise is certainly exciting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Codemasters’ F1 series has taken hundreds of hours from me since 2017, and in return it’s given me a rich, new sports fandom even in my late 40s. And now, F1 2021 is teaching me to expect imperfection, to own my mistakes, and forgive myself.

hi-fi-rush,"I had a smile on my face from beginning to end while playing Hi-Fi Rush. Its colorful graphics, loveable characters and positive story made it an absolute joy to play. Don’t let the rhythm-based combat scare you, just give it a try and you’ll be tapping your feet and buttons to the beat in no time.",,,"There's an infectious, easy-going joy to this whole adventure and it's backed up by addictive melee gameplay that strikes a masterful balance between having enough depth to challenge rhythm game aficionados whilst also making sure there's enough flexibility that, even if you're not particularly great at sticking to the beat, you'll still have a great time. It doesn't take itself too seriously, in short, and it's all the better for it.","It combines showstopping unique gameplay with some of the best cel-shaded visuals, a superb soundtrack, a fun tone and great characters into one of the most memorable games in the past little while. It’s the type of game that reminds you why you fell in love with the genre in the first place.",,"There is nothing as addictive, fun and well-built as Hi-Fi Rush in the Xbox catalog. It is a must-have game. Its art design, its playable base and its ability to grab the player are brilliant.","Best of all, the execution is perfect, delighting us with a very fresh, unique and original proposal that works wonderfully, an impeccable visual style with personality, characters that overflow with charisma, outstanding combat, a soundtrack of 10 and a development that does not know the word boredom. Without a doubt, a very necessary game in an industry where new ideas are increasingly scarce and where fun is not always easy to find. Do not hesitate and give it a chance, we assure you that you will not regret letting yourself be seduced by its catchy rhythm.","Hi-Fi Rush is an utterly beguiling new take on rhythm-action, combining some of this generation’s most impressive visuals with music and mayhem.","From beginning to end, Hi-Fi RUSH is a rhythmic thrill ride replete with stunning art design, fantastically fun gameplay, and a surprisingly evocative narrative of friendship and determination.",,"Hi-Fi RUSH is a highly enjoyable action-adventure fuses the solid, hack n’ slash combat of Devil May Cry with enthralling rhythm-based mechanics, while also blurring the lines between anime and Saturday Morning Cartoons to deliver a larger-than-life protagonist whose story is just as much fun to watch as he is to play.","Hi-Fi RUSH nails pretty much every aspect of its formula: art style, gameplay, technical production, characters, and soundtrack. Even if its mechanics are after all quite simple, it's definitely a must-play game and a great new IP we'd love to see expanded in the future.","This is an impeccable platform and action title, which bases all its gameplay on the rhythm of the music and which makes everything have outstanding fluidity. The difficulty of timing is adjustable so just about anyone can enjoy the game, pulling off combos and powerful attacks without having to be a timing ace. The protagonists and the final bosses have an exquisite personality and designs and give more power to a story that has its plot twists and its slightly more emotional and profound moments. Although Hi-Fi RUSH doesn't have an epic story, it has everything necessary to captivate you from the beginning, and together with that feeling of fluidity when playing, it leaves a very good taste in the mouth after a few hours at the controls. The game improves until practically its end, so we won't be able to stop playing until we discover what SPECTRA is and what they want to use it for. In addition, once we complete Hi-Fi RUSH, we can replay the levels to discover each and every one of the secrets that the levels hide, so we have an incentive to play them again. Or if you are a completionist, you have at your disposal the Wall of Fame, where a good handful of challenges await you. As you can see, Hi-Fi RUSH has everything it takes to become a title that many of us will remember over the years. If you are a fan of platform games, action games, or you just like music and video games, you have to give Hi-Fi RUSH a try, I assure you that you will not regret it.",,,"Tango Gameworks’ rhythm-based actioner is not only one of the most enjoyable games in years, it’s also one of the most stunningly beautiful, with fantastic music and beat-matching combat to boot. Hi-Fi Rush is, indeed, as its name suggests, a rush.","What a slap! With this luminous shadow drop sold at a low price and integrated into the Game Pass, Bethesda sends the conventions of the video game industry waltzing away. From the waltz to Tango Gameworks, there is only one step that we invite you to take without delay. After fear, the studio brilliantly relies on ardor. Hi-Fi RUSH plays a score of all the devils where rhythm, platform and fight form an euphoric melody and without major false note. By playing on the measures but having fun in excess, this rush is our crush from the beginning of the year.",,,"Hi-Fi RUSH came out of nowhere and floored me. It is one of my favorite-looking games, maybe ever. The combat is sublime, the story is great, and the music just works. Tango Gameworks has shifted from making ok to good horror games and created one of my favorite action platformers of all time.","Hi-Fi Rush will make us feel that we are enjoying an interactive animated show. It is a game with high production standards, whose music-based gameplay will make us enjoy an excellent playlist while we face a mega corporation. Those who love series like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta will be delighted.","Even with its few distracting flaws, almost anyone will find something worthwhile in Hi-Fi Rush. Its seamless integration of rhythm into exploration and combat is met with a harmonious and interesting soundtrack. Colorful, engaging, and funny, anybody will be able to pick up this title easily.",,,,,,"What likely started out as an Xbox and/or Bethesda executive thinking “Hey, wouldn’t it be neat if we kept this game a secret and launched it during a special event?” has led to what could easily wind up as one of this year’s GOTY contenders exploding onto the scene in spectacular fashion. Hi-Fi Rush is classic video game action that blends amazing combat in a unique hybrid of genres in with memorable characters, a wicked sense of humor, terrific gameplay that’s accessible for all players and mind-blowing visuals and music. It’s an instant classic, even without the shadow drop, and delivers a candy-coated blast of chaos that conceals a clear labor of love and a weird purity to it all that you need to experience.",,,,,"A half-dozen hours with Hi-Fi Rush so far, and I can’t stop smiling...It’s a game that’s easy to love, difficult to put down, and just an utter delight to spend time with. What a great way to start 2023. [Review in Progress]",,,,"After a lackluster line-up in 2022, Microsoft is back in business with Hi-Fi Rush and you are in for a treat especially if you already have a game pass membership.","I can't imagine any of Hi-Fi RUSH getting old. It's so vibrant, so full of life, and so unique. It stands out in a world where many AAA releases seem determined to be anything but. Add in the replay value of chasing high scores and Rhythm Tower, which functions a lot like Devil May Cry's Bloody Palace mode, and this is a game that you can play for a long time.",,,,,"Even though it has flashes of games that came before, Hi-Fi Rush is a unique, masterful game that accomplishes everything it sets out to with plenty of style and charm to spare.",,,"Tango Gameworks breaks from expectation to release a bold rhythm-action game where combat isn't set to the sound of music but driven by it entirely. With its awesome battles, vivid visual design, and unwavering commitment to comedy, Hi-Fi Rush is an undeniably wild ride that shouldn't be ignored.",,,"Hi-Fi Rush is oozing with style and confidence, but like a messy first album, there are some deep cut tracks that don’t hit as hard as the opening few hits. What can’t be denied, however, is how excited we are for the sophomore effort, and the seemingly limitless versatility that Tango Gameworks have shown off in this bold, out-of-nowhere joy.","Hi-Fi Rush is a thrilling rhythm game that oozes both style and substance, offering one of the biggest surprise hits in recent memory.",,,Hi-Fi Rush mixes the intensity and complexity of a hack'n slash with the high demanding precision of a rhythm game. The result is a fresh and vibrant experience where every combat encounter is a rush of adrenaline.,,,,"Hi-Fi Rush is a gamble won hands down by Tango Gameworks. Venturing into unknown terrain, the software house behind The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo brings a light-hearted, stylish and addictive experience to the Microsoft ecosystem. One combo after another, the songs that accompany the crazy mission of Chai and his companions have conquered us, for a new IP that we hope represents only the first in a series of unexpected experiments for the Bethesda team. Hi-Fi Rush - available on Xbox Game Pass or in standalone format for 29.99 euros - is in short a thick action game, capable of giving gamers the most important thing: hours and hours of fun.",,,,"Hi-Fi Rush excellently blends the action and rhythm game genres like few before it managed to do. It's fresh and fun, it has a lighthearted and enjoyable storyline, but yet is supported by a massively deep combat system. And lot, lot of extra-content after you finish it.",,,"Hi-Fi Rush is an energetic and frantic game, with lots of character and characters. Some of its bosses encounters are amongst the best I've played in a long time. The weakest part is its rhythm-based system, but the game is smart enough to let the players enjoy it even when they're not beating everything up following its tempo.",Tango Gameworks has done it once again. Hi-Fi Rush a fantastic experience that combines hack and slash with rhythm games spectacularly.,"Hi-Fi Rush is a rhythmic adventure full of action, humor and love for videogames, which no fan of the genre should miss.",,"Settling into Hi-Fi Rush's groove might require a recalibration - in your head, if not the latency settings - and the rewards are more intermittent than we'd like, but when they come, they're considerably greater than the occasional cheer from a non-existent audience. [Issue#382, p.98]",,,,,,,"A very welcome surprise, that is one of the most enjoyably unique games on Xbox and one of the best rhythm action games in a very long time - as well as having arguably the best cel-shaded graphics ever seen.",,"Hi Fi Rush is a surprise in every way: launch, gameplay, story, voice acting, performance... the first must-have of 2023.","It's been a long time since a game has conquered us like Hi-Fi Rush did. From the very beginning, Tango Gameworks' title grabbed us by the collar and never let us go until the end credits, and we're asking for more. From its original concept executed with a cheeky mastery to its setting filled with a fine and universal humor, this is a project of enthusiasts for enthusiasts, you can feel it and it obviously warms your heart. You were looking for the first essential of 2023? Well, here it is!",,,"Hi-Fi Rush is a celebration of the videogame. A perfect fusion of hack and slash and rhythm game, with stunning art and positive vibes. We need more surprises like this.",,"Hi-Fi Rush is not only a great surprise for the whole Xbox audience, but also a strong contender for the Game of the Year. Tango Gameworks should definitely experiment more often.",,,,"Hi-Fi Rush is a nice surprise from Tango Gameworks. The originality of the combat system, halfway in the world of rhythm games, is a gimmick that gives the game its strength but also its biggest weakness, making it repetitive. With ten hours to finish the game, it's not a torture either.",,"Hi-Fi Rush is a great little rock-and-roll game and one that deserves every ounce of praise it gets. From the lovable cast, to the incredible gameplay, Hi-Fi Rush is the ultimate hack-and-slash-rhythm game that every Xbox owner must play.","Hi-Fi RUSH is an absolute delight. A simple idea that could have been extremely difficult to correctly develop, Hi-Fi RUSH is a real joy to play. Here's hoping that there are many more brilliant surprises to come this year, as Hi-Fi RUSH sets a high bar.",,,"Despite these missteps, Hi-Fi Rush is a tremendous game that's equal parts explosive, joyous, and dripping with style. It feeds on the power of nostalgia by evoking games like Jet Set Radio and Viewtiful Joe with its old-school vibes and contagious energy, but it's also completely fresh and exciting in its own right. For as much as I adore horror games and have enjoyed Tango's previous output with The Evil Within series and Ghostwire: Tokyo, it's refreshing that the studio hasn't been pigeonholed into creating games within a singular genre, and can suddenly emerge one day with an infectious rhythm-action game that is sure to live long in the memory.",,,,,,,,,"For someone who also works in music journalism, my skills are shaky, to say the least. But, having taken the time to improve these skills, I now feel better equipped to appreciate the game for what it is: a fun, quirky, sometimes weird, and often cheesy critique of capitalism. When I was less focused on how perfectly I was playing, I had a much better time headbanging through each stage. Just give me a wider variety of music next time and I’m sold.","Hi-Fi Rush is a charming action game with a great art style, fun characters, and solid mechanics. Sometimes, that's all you need.",,,,,"Hi-Fi Rush cracks the rhythm-action genre wide open to deliver Tango Gameworks' most confident, stylish, and surprising project to date.",,"This is a world that, robot assassins aside, is pleasurable to exist within and to explore, made all the sweeter by virtue of its unexpected arrival.",,,,,,"Hi-Fi Rush is unashamed to be loud and brash and playful, and it's confident in its execution. On the surface it might seem frivolous but there's a deep battle system here that rewards combo memory and, of course, rhythm. It's upbeat, wide-eyed and unpretentious, but that's all part of its inescapable charm, a game that appeased my inner teen and rewarded musicality in equal measure. I had a blast. [Eurogamer Recommended]","I’m still pretty early in HI-Fi Rush, but there’s something kind of magical about every fight feeling like it could be choreographed on a piece of sheet music. It excels in style and humor, has some great musical picks, and despite being a rhythm game, it doesn’t lose sight of the depth and skill that you need to play an action game. I’m excited to keep going and see where Chai’s silly story takes me. [Impressions]","The shadow drop was novel in and of itself, but the game is a triumph. The gorgeous animations and Jet Set Radio-esque art style are vivid and arresting. The array of tutorials, visual aids, and clever mechanics makes the rhythm aspects approachable to genre newcomers. And the vibrant, positive energy is present in every beat, keeping you tapping your feet as you take down a corporation built on a lack of vision. Hi-Fi Rush is a cathartic anthem that arrived at the perfect time.",,,,"Hi-Fi Rush is a wonderful reminder of why we play games in the first place. The point is to enjoy yourself, to get away from everyday reality for a moment, to have an amazing adventure, to feel rewarded when you make progress and to smile at the thought of returning to the colorful world on the other side of the screen. This brilliant rhythm/action game gives you all that and much more.","Hi-Fi Rush has turned out to be a real surprise. It does so by allying itself with rhythm to power up attacks, but also with a design that works both inside and outside of combat arenas. [Recommended]","A week ago, we didn't know that something like this was going to happen. Today, it's hard to get the game out of your mind. Hi-Fi RUSH is a unique mix of fun action and great music, which will put a smile on your face from pure joy.","I simply have to salute Bethesda and Microsoft, and first and foremost the developer Tango Gameworks for a blockbuster release and a game that I'd probably call one of the best platformers I've played during my almost 50 years on planet Earth.",,,,Hi-Fi Rush lives up to the hype it has received. It’s a fun experience with a musical backbone that works perfectly with its action platformer roots. Definitely a huge plus for the Xbox family.,"Hi-Fi Rush is a rock-themed masterpiece rhythm-action game. Its combat makes you feel like you’re performing on stage, and its wholesome story is exhilarating throughout. In 2023, there is simply no rhythm-action game that we could recommend more.",,,,,,,,,"Hi-Fi Rush is a light-hearted game about comradery and taking down corpo, mixing fantastic animation, amazing character development, larger than life bosses and more charm than a bassist after getting props for a gig. If Bethesda is doing games like this in 2023, hand me that guitar pick. I'm ready to rock!","Hi-Fi Rush is going to stay with me. I absolutely adore this game, far, far more than I would I would have imagined, given everything said above. It is, quite literally, infectious, as you will not only find yourself involuntarily bopping along with the beat as you play, but even after you’ve shut the game off... It’s joyful, addicting and something I may play twice just for the hell of it. An absolute win.","Everything comes together wonderfully, with the combat, platforming, music, and visuals complementing each other perfectly.","Hi-Fi Rush delivers energizing gameplay that is smoother than slide guitar. It's accessible, satisfying, and just pure fun. The touching narrative explores themes of friendship and loyalty, while satirizing corporate culture with an unparalleled wit. Tango Gameworks have knocked it out of the park with their first foray away from the horror game genre and I am eager to see what comes next.","Hi-Fi RUSH is an amazing rhythmic and action game that feels unique in the Xbox repertoire. With great combat, charismatic cast and an unbelievable world, it is a must play for everyone with a Xbox Series X|S.","Hi-Fi Rush arrived by surprise, unassumingly, without many compromises, and just like a rock star, it uses its personality to get the audience off the ground and mark everyone with a memorable experience. Although it still has an air of ""experimentation"" with bold gameplay but knows how to ""step on the brakes,"" Chai's adventure can quietly be considered one of the best surprises of recent times, and is probably what many gamers were needing but didn't know yet.",It's so nice to have a surprise like this come out of nowhere...and at the end of the year I expect I'm still going to be thinking about this when it comes to game of the year time. It would have made my Top 10 last year. - JG [Quick Look],"After two hours with the game, Hi-Fi Rush has immediately left a really great first impression. While some of this may be due to my own personal nostalgia and Xbox’s unique release structure, there’s such a strong sense of voice and style throughout every aspect of the game, right down to Chai’s clean character design that feels like Marty McFly crossed with Joe Musashi’s flowing scarf. By the time I got to the first boss fight, which was set to the beat of “1,000,000” by Nine Inch Nails, I was sold. I know we’re only a month into the new year, but I think we already have a contender for best surprise of 2023. [Early Impressions]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
return-to-monkey-island,"Fans of point and click puzzle games from the 90’s will love this new adventure. If you are a Monkey Island veteran, or a newcomer to the series, you will love this new adventure. It’s full of heart, full of humor, and full of puzzles that will sometimes make you scratch your head, and if my dad were still around, he’d walk by me and say, “That’s not it”. How did he know?","Despite its announcement on April Fools Day, Return to Monkey Island is no joke, even though the game is full of them. Crafted with respect for veterans and newcomers alike, Return to Monkey Island shows that the puzzles in puzzle games can be just as memorable as the story and characters. Yes, the ending is a squib, and clicking on items in tight-knit spaces is annoying, but otherwise this is a true belter of a puzzler. An exceptional love letter to 90s point and click adventuring, and a faithful-but-remodelled experience from top-to-bottom, Return to Monkey Island is definitely worth this return visit and then some….no disguises necessary!",,,"It’s Guybrush, LeChuck, Elaine and all the others, cracking wise as they have always done, with a luminous cast of characters, some fantastically abstract item combinations, and the odd three-headed monkey. If Return to Monkey Island is the rebirth of the series, we’ll put in an order for seven or eight.",,"Guybrush is back with a game that features all the best characteristics of the Monkey Island saga. If you have to play only one game in 2022, let it be Return to Monkey Island.",,,,,,,,,,"Often, belated sequels carry a weight of expectation that's hard to live up to. Return to Monkey Island has no such difficulties, Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman going back to a series they quite clearly still love, and, you’ll love too.",,,,"Return to Monkey Island is great. It takes the adventure game to new heights of hilarity with a clever narrative, fantastic stylized graphics, wonderful music, and a huge amount of heart.",Return to Monkey Island is a love letter to fans of the long-running franchise. It will have you enjoying the funny situations while it makes you solve difficult puzzles. The game had a change of artistic style that fits very well with the saga.,,,,,,,,,"Less quirky and difficult than it once was, the developers are clearly trying to please long-time fans by revealing the coveted secret of Monkey Island while bringing in a new audience less used to the Point and Click genre. The whole thing is a nostalgic and well-thought-out adventure, all wrapped up in a stunning fourth chapter with quite a surprising finale. It’s enough to leave us with good memories of Guybrush who, in 1990, was looking to become a pirate and who is now looking for himself in the eyes of his son.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is an interactive experience and a visit to the museum of video games. It’s not just a collection, it is a Celebration.","More than a compilation, this is better described as a virtual museum with more than 90 games to play with. An ode to the history of Atari and a game collectors must have in their libraries.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Digital Eclipse did a stellar job paying homage to Atari’s rise and fall. If you’re a classic gamer/Atari fan you’ll have a blast. Outside of that demographic, I worry the $50 price point is a little steep. Having not grown up in the 80’s arcades, I rarely had a good time with most of the games. I never went into this review with a mindset that I would, nor did it cloud my judgement. Playing this game, I appreciated it for what it was. I love researching gaming, as a lover of the art form. Collections like this are important. For anyone wanting to learn about a pivotal era in gaming, check out Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.",,,,,,"The team at Digital Eclipse has done some of their finest work with Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.

Not sure what is next on their docket, but I cannot wait to play it. As it stands this collection is a must for anyone who calls video games their hobby. It is absolutely incredible on every level and I spent hours just absorbing all the content here. Sure I would love some DLC (Ultra Vortek anyone?) but what is here is more than worth the price of admission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration sets a new bar of quality for both game collections and documentary series.

psychonauts-2,"Psychonauts 1 is the perfect example of the term cult classic, and Psychonauts 2 has created another masterpiece that I am only assuming won’t receive the attention it deserves. They have perfected and expanded on their original idea in every way and created a world full of heart and fun. It’s been well documented that the last few years it took to bake were used to expand the boss battles, and finely polish the areas that were complete. It’s clear that the added funds from being a Microsoft studio were put to good use and the team at Double Fine should be very proud of what they have created. I cannot wait to see what they create next.","Overall and with no real negatives to speak of, Psychonauts 2 is certainly up there with the best games to have been released in 2021 so far. It maintains a strong showing throughout whilst keeping players engaged with fresh and unique environments, and with satisfying gameplay and a wacky story to boot, there is plenty to sink your teeth into throughout the 15-hour runtime.","Psychonauts 2 recaptures the humor, heart, and much of the creative magic of the original game, with modern refinements that make it more pleasant to play. While the combat still feels a bit clunky and outdated compared to the rest of the game, fans of the original will no doubt delight in revisiting old friends and making new ones in this charming adventure.","It's honestly astounding how incredible Psychonauts 2 is. After 16 years, the expectations for the sequel were so high it felt as though they were impossible to meet. We don't know how they did it, but the wizards at Double Fine not only met them but smashed through them with ease. Psychonauts 2 is an extraordinary achievement in both its gameplay and storytelling, balancing heavy themes of mental health with its whimsical world. In lesser hands, it could have been a disaster, but the team has taken every aspect of the original game, built upon it and respected the fanbase in the process. Psychonauts 2 is the best game of 2021 so far and one of the greatest sequels ever made.","Psychonauts 2 is an absolute hoot from start to finish. It showcases a lot of what makes video games great, combining skillful and emotive storytelling with inventive gameplay that above all else, is loads of fun.",,"Psychonauts 2 is undoubtedly the best title Double Fine has produced in its 20 years of life. A unique, original and, above all, fun adventure.","This is a fantastic action platformer, full of imagination and a great sense of humor, that proves, once again, the talent and creativity you can find in Double Fine.","A decade and a half on from the original, Psychonauts 2 is a worthy successor to Double Fine's cult classic. The platforming and combat gameplay is tighter, the world design is as varied and inventive as ever, and while the story is full of twists, turns and comedic moments, there's also a wonderful sense of empathy and tenderness throughout. Simply put, Psychonauts 2 has been worth the wait.","Psychonauts 2 is a fantastic love letter to fans of the original Psychonauts and 3D platformers. If you're in the mood for a game that offers tons of laughs, thought-provoking storytelling, striking visuals, and fun gameplay, look no further than Psychonauts 2.",,,"Psychonauts 2 is a unique platform game, capable of taking its place in the hearts of video game lovers. The original gameplay, design and script are the strengths of a game that succeeds in keeping us glued to the screen until the end credits. A title that isn't perfect, but that shows how creativity and passion can overcome the limitations of an adventure that no fan of the genre should miss.","Psychonauts 2 is one of the best 3D platformers that I have ever played. It is a game that exudes charisma and personality on all sides and that raises the bar to an even higher level than its first part. It has a gameplay and story that hooks you from the first minute and that together with its graphic, sound and spectacular performance, it becomes a serious candidate for GOTY.","Both as a sequel and as a standalone game, Psychonauts 2 is superb. It's fresh, it's innovative, it's brilliantly presented and delivered, and it genuinely feels like the follow-up the original cult classic deserves. Stages flow fantastically on your first visit, and my only real complaint here would be that some can feel comparably rather bitty or unconnected when you return to them later to mop up things you may have missed, which couldn't really be avoided without forcing full replays, set pieces and all. It's an imaginative adventure that has been well worth the wait, and I'd encourage everyone to give it a go. If you think creativity is dead, you haven't played Psychonauts 2.",,"We may have been waiting a decade and a half for a sequel, but Double Fine’s efforts haven’t been in vain - Psychonauts 2 is an energetic, imaginative, and excellent 3D platformer, with brains and heart to spare.","If one feels the mechanics of the old-school 3D platformer at the heart of the structure of Psychonauts 2, the reunion with Raz has never been so modern and pleasant. Funny, touching, ultra creative, more precise in its gameplay than before, Psychonauts 2 is a generous and rhythmic game, which offers between 15 and 20 hours of a particularly successful experience. Certainly, we will deplore a challenge in withdrawal, bosses perhaps less crazy than in the past or the absence of French dubbing, but nothing to sulk his pleasure in the face of this breathless, funny and touching adventure located in a universe that it is so refreshing to explore.",,"Tim Schafer did it again. Psychonauts 2 is another old-school 3D platform from the creator of Monkey Island and Brutal Legend, that delivers a funny and engaging adventure with plenty of unforgettable, crazy characters.",,,,,"After more than fifteen years, Raz’s return is everything fans could have hoped for. It tells a wonderful story about how we have to learn from our mistakes and continue to grow while keeping the humor we expect from any Double Fine production. Now and then, the control scheme can be a minor pain, but most of the time, it plays like a dream with a level of polish few games launch with anymore. Psychonauts 2 is one of the best games of 2021. Hopefully, we won’t have to wait another sixteen years to team back up with the Psychonauts.",,,,"Psychonauts 2 is one of the year’s most enjoyable games and one of the best modern platformers of the past few years. The creativity in the visuals and level design is still on display at full blast, the story is superb and shows no fear when it comes to tackling mature subjects and the action is nice and intense, creating a perfect level of challenge.",,"Psychonauts 2 is the sequel to a video game masterpiece, a little-known nugget that still deserves all the praise it received when it was released. Double Fine and Tim Schafer had the difficult task of bringing the first opus out of anonymity while offering a sequel that was up to the task. Psychonauts 2 manages to reach this summit, to stand next to this firmament by taking back what made the first one a critical success while making it more accessible. Psychonauts 2 is a generous, funny, surprising, intelligent game with an excellent narrative and engaging characters. However, newcomers may be a bit lost because this second episode follows the plot directly after the first one, while old players may criticize it for remaining a bit too wise and losing the impertinence of its humor. However, the success remains undeniable with regard to the challenge and arouses the desire to get lost in the psychic adventures of Razputin! Let's put on our aviator glasses and go back!","In addition to its excellent platforming, puzzles, and action, Psychonauts 2 impresses the most because it treats human frailty and failure with warmth, compassion, and humor that is never cruel or demeaning. Inside our heads, we’re all just bundles of doubt, random connections, ill-considered motivations, and weird memories mixed with kindness, aspiration, and delight. I’m grateful to Psychonauts 2 for the reminder.",,,,,,"The second entry in the Psychonauts series is pure fun thanks to its solid level design and great story telling and characters, and even though the long development process had its marks on the gameplay, it still represents a magical experience that can probably only be found in Nintendo games.","Psychonauts 2 is brilliant. It's one of the most creative experiences released in recent years, if not in the last console generation. Sure, it could push platforming boundaries a bit more or distance itself further from the genre's shortcomings, but it's a set of minor annoyances in what's otherwise a sensitive and splendid odyssey.","It is extremely funny to me, that a game that's mainly focused on brains, would be all heart. But hey - that's Psychonauts 2 for you: A brilliant game from the brilliant minds in Double Fine Studios.",,,"Despite a lockdown hanging over my head, I couldn’t help but giggle at Psychonauts 2’s stupid jokes and wackiness. Nor could I help but apply a lesson or two along the way.","Psychonauts 2 is bigger, better, and more ambitious than its predecessor in every way imaginable.",,"Even in those moments of collectible cursing, I had an absolute blast playing Psychonauts 2. It’s rare that a long-awaited sequel does most things right, but this is one of those times and I’m confident in saying that Psychonauts 2 is Double Fine’s best game to date and an early contender for game of the year. Just don’t keep us waiting a decade for the next one.","Psychonauts 2 captures the spirit of '90s cartoons and channels it into an imaginative, inventive adventure that never fails to find heart and humor in every one of its consciousness-expanding encounters.",,,"It’s always a risk creating a sequel to a cult classic so long after the original, but in Psychonauts 2, Double Fine haven’t only made a game that respects the original and takes it’s characters to new heights, they’ve set themselves, and new owners Microsoft, up with a platforming franchise that can thrive for years to come.","Psychonauts 2 completely surpasses the exceptional original game, and if tight platforming and Double Fine charm are what you're into. you should play it asap.",,,"Double Fine Studios brings us a brilliant platform game, in which every level offers a fresh experience. We love the characters, the art direction, the music, and the sense of humor. This sequel was worth the wait.","As Psychonauts 2 surprisingly deepens the Psychonauts story and its characters, throws new twists and turns and improves on all aspects of the original, the sequel is well worth the wait for fans. In the meantime, however, much better platformers have appeared on the market and therefore Psychonauts 2 will not be able to convince all newcomers, although Game Pass offers a solution in that regard.",The richness and cartoonish sincerity of Psychonauts’s world makes playing the game feel like switching on the TV for some well-written Saturday morning cartoons.,,"It is true that he does not invent anything in terms of game mechanics and does not shine from a technical point of view, but he has an extremely distinctive style and manages to cement an imaginary that for many will be unforgettable. Let's give him the space he deserves.",,"I adored almost every second of Psychonauts 2. It achieves something I don’t often see in games – a continual sense of awe as each of its worlds unfold. It took 16 years to reach release, but Double Fine has delivered an incredible sequel. I hope we get a third installment that doesn’t take nearly as long to create.",,,"Psychonauts 2 brings together classic platforming, an engaging story and well realised combat in a package that feels reminiscent of the best platformers of decades past. Even better, it does this with a visual flair that’s unmatched by its contemporaries. It might be more of the same, but given how unique it is, that’s hardly a bad thing.",,,Psychonauts 2 is just brilliant. Double Fine and Tim Schafer is presenting one of the best games of the year and one of the best 3D platformers in a long time.,"Psychonauts 2 is easily one of the best games on Xbox Game Pass and a must-play for the subscribers. It's a safe and traditional second entry in the franchise, but nonetheless a new gem in Tim Schafer's crown.",,"Long before this smart, sweet story has come to a satisfying close, it has taught us to treasure others for their flaws as well as their strengths. ""We all deserve a second chance,"" one character says. Schafer and company have grasped theirs. [Issue#363, p.102]","There are moments when elements jarringly clash, though. It can occasionally feel weird combing the environment for collectibles in the midst of a dramatic scene, or having minor dialogue loop incessantly, taking away from the otherwise impeccable and engrossing world. Such minor complaints truly sizzle into nothing though when compared to the gigantic achievements of Psychonauts 2. It's the kind of game that feels like it only comes around a scant few times per console generation. In an industry that can sometimes feel like it's just regurgitating the same cynical product repeatedly, Psychonauts 2 is a beaming ray of unbridled imagination. One that will hopefully get the love it’s due.","16 years after the first Psychonauts, the long-awaited sequel is here. A sequel that feels familiar, yet time improved in every way. Just like its predecessor, we get clever platforming, imaginative worlds, and wonderful characters. Unfortunately, we also get substandard battles, uneven level design and a somewhat unpolished package. It is quite noticeable that Psychonauts 2 is a grassroots-funded indie game at its core, but in the end its not all that hard to forgive the faults.",Psychonauts 2 is a lively action-platformer that also manages to be thoughtful and deeply moving.,Incredibly charming psycho trip full of bizarre ideas as well as abilities and a hint of collectable madness.,,"Psychonauts 2 is a difficult game to describe. At times, its refusal to step out of the past can be extremely frustrating, but not often enough to dampen the good times. It’s absolutely greater than the sum of its parts, and when taken as a whole, once the credits have rolled, it easily possesses the strongest narrative of any game this year. Above all else, Psychonauts 2 is unapologetically Double Fine. It’s sweet, funny and has a deep reverence for the games that came before it. The graphics and art direction are some of the prettiest I’ve ever seen, a shining example of the value that a strong visual style can have over mere graphical prowess. Psychonauts 2 is the result of a studio operating at the absolute top of its game. It’s an absolute must-play for anyone looking for a great story, deep characters and jaw-dropping visuals.",A great sequel that is just as surreal and imaginative as the original and manages to be both a silly comedy platformer and a surprisingly affecting character study of regret and lost love.,,,,"Psychonauts 2 managed to restore my faith in the genre of 3D platformers. This is a creative volcano spewing ideas left and right - it can make you laugh, it can make you cry, it can make you think. And it will definitely make you have fun.","In pretty much every possible way, Psychonauts 2 is a direct sequel to the first game. It's perhaps prettier and more polished than it would have been if it had come out a decade ago, but the feel and tone are spot-on. It probably won't change your mind if the original Psychonauts didn't capture your heart. If it did, though, Psychonauts 2 is a charming, funny and incredibly welcome visit with some old friends. The gameplay is sometimes too straightforward for its own good, but everything else more than makes up for it. If you're looking for a charming platformer with its own style and sense of humor, Psychonauts 2 delivers in spades. Here's hoping it won't be another decade before we see another entry in the series.",,"Anyone that was a fan of the original game will likely love Psychonauts 2, as it improves on everything that made the first game great. But newcomers should also make it a point to check the game out, as it's a phenomenal 3D platformer and a Game of the Year contender. And while it's worth every penny, Psychonauts 2 is also on Xbox Game Pass thanks to Microsoft's acquisition of Double Fine, so anyone interested can try it out without making a big financial commitment.","Psychonauts 2 is a true sequel, that evolves a lot of ideas from original game, while still stays true to the style the fans love. If you're looking for something special, then this title is fore you. Whimsical and fun Psychonauts 2 is one of the best games we played this year.","Psychonauts 2 was a long time in the making, but the wait has certainly been worth it.",,,"All the craziness and narrative talent we expect from Double Fine but the gameplay is a little too nostalgic. This is a good way to discover the old fashioned way of doing plateforme games, but Psychonauts 2 lacks in rhythm and intuitiveness.","Psychonauts 2 is another great entry in the series, a action-platformer that can look a bit stiff and not very challenging, but has a lot of surface to explore and motivates us to explore every corner thanks to its incredible art direction, stellar characters and story. One of the most refreshing games of 2021.","Psychonauts 2 is a superb sequel that appeals to both long-time fans and newcomers. With a engaging story full of twists and turns, excellent witty dialogue, and a gorgeous visual palette, exploring people's minds has never been so fun and thrilling.",,"Those nitpicks out of the way, Psychonauts 2 is an absolute joy to play. It’s hard to put down not only because it’s a solid game from top to bottom, but also because it’s just so damn charming. I wanted to spend as much time as possible with Raz and his crew of zany characters, and I imagine that just about anyone who decides to pick up Psychonauts 2 will feel the same way.","You might groan and grumble as Razputin messes up yet another jump, but as Psychonauts 2 progresses, unravelling yet another spectacular world for you to explore, you’ll likely forget about any frustrations. This is a brilliantly designed game, and it’s clear a huge amount of ingenuity has gone into its creation. Whether you’re battling hand-puppets, talking to a papercraft William Shakespeare or gambling inside a maternity ward (no, really), one thing is for sure: you’re going to have a lot of fun playing Psychonauts 2.","On the surface, Psychonauts 2 is an engaging, ambitious, honed-in take on colorful 3D platformers. However, the most rewarding aspect hasn't just been mastering its platforms or combat, but peeling back the layers to see what's beneath it; to take a closer look at its characters, the depth of their struggles, fears, and regrets, all of which serve as the game's foundation. It's an emotional, hilarious, and, at times, devastating story, but a story about forgiveness and second chances. It's an astonishing achievement in nearly every regard and the quintessential display of Double Fine's mastery in story, gameplay, and distinct direction, making it the studio's best game to date.",,,,,"Psychonauts 2 also just oozes style in every way. If you haven’t played a Double Fine game before, perhaps you’re not familiar with this, but the studio almost always finds a way to craft unique worlds that are unlike anything else you’ll see from video games. From the music, to the art style, to even the characters, everything within Psychonauts 2 has a distinct, zany tone. And despite being so off the wall, all of the game’s different elements work together in great harmony to create something that is novel in every way.",,"While this series does not have the popularity that other platforming games have, Psychonauts 2 will undoubtedly be the most fun, unique and memorable platform game you will play in recent years.","Psychonauts 2 may not be the most brilliant platformer ever, but just like the first part, this adventure is bursting with clever inventions and creativity. The forays into the inside of the brain are not only funny and original, but are always linked to the intriguing main story in surprising ways. The extensive cast of colorful characters and the game world filled with extras do the rest of the work. After a long wait, Psychonauts has finally received a worthy sequel.",,,"With Psychonauts 2 Tim Schafer delivers the sequel every fan has been looking forward to. It's creative, diversified, funny, tremendously motivating and good looking, too. But you don't need to be a fan of the first part. Even if you don't know much about Raz, his family or the psychonauts, the game is an engaging action adventure everybody needs to play.",,Prepare to go insane in the brain with one of the year's most imaginative interactive experiences.,,Empathetic storytelling and mind-bending level design make Psychonauts 2 a worthy follow-up to one of gaming's great cult classics.,"The sequel, by definition, cannot pack the same shock, but it arrives bearing new gifts.","I’ve rarely played anything that is so unashamedly itself. Each hour is different, each character distinct and memorable, each new psychic playground full of surprises. There are a few things here that belong back in 2005, such as an obsession with collectibles and a redundant tree of upgrades that only confuses the array of psychic powers. But this is a standout title that reminds us why 3D platformers were once gaming’s most popular genre.","Psychonauts 2 is a masterclass in design. Some of the levels in the game will stick with me for another 16 years easily. I hate that it took this long for Tim Schafer and his team to get the chance to make this sequel, but it was truly worth the wait.","If you ever enjoyed the original, or just like the idea of a psychic-themed 3D platformer, I'm sure that you'll like Psychonauts 2 and find plenty of laughs along the way.","Psychonauts 2 is one of the best games of 2021 — and the best ones Double Fine has ever made — so play it and make sure this becomes a bonafide classic, not a cult classic like its predecessor.","The whole Double Fine team pulled it off. Psychonauts 2 is one of the best video games I have ever played, and if anything in this review sounds like you and your family's bag, don't hesitate to join me in loving the heck out of it. [Ars Technica Approved]",,"Psychonauts 2 is, once again, a universe of damaged teachers and teaching environments, a space for thinking through dark thoughts with varying degrees of earnestness and absurdity. Its worlds are works of matchless invention, its characters a joy to exist alongside. I might have missed it first time round, but I'm glad that games like this are still being made. [Recommended]","Psychonauts 2 isn’t about gunning down the big boss at the end and cheering over their dead body. It’s about understanding that even the biggest asshole is still a person, and deep down they may just need some help. We all need some help sometimes. The key is asking for it. Today, in 2021, it’s easy to look around and see people who seem cruel and evil, and to assume they are lost souls, not worth saving. Psychonauts 2 says otherwise. It says that everyone can change. I’m not sure I fully believe that, but I’ll be damned if that’s not one hell of a hopeful message.","For fans of the original game, Psychonauts 2 is a fantastic follow-up that offers a constant tide of twists and turns. Whether you’ve been waiting 15 years for the sequel, or are interested in checking the series out for the first time, rest assured that this is one of the most imaginative platforming games out there, with an absolute flood of joyous ideas and images. [Recommended]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Psychonauts is back with a charming, challenging, thoroughly entertaining sequel that will please 3D platformer fans and especially anyone who loved the first game.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Psychonauts 2 is exactly what I was hoping for in a follow-up. Double Fine has smartly refined its unique brand of platforming adventure while greatly expanding its narrative qualities. Plus, it's an absolute treat for the eyes and ears. This is how you do a sequel.","The universe of Psychonauts 2 is as creative and mind-bending as you would expect, but the 3D platforming still feels rooted in the past.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hitman-3,,,"Hitman 3 is a fantastic capstone to a standout series. Yes, a lot of what you experience will seem familiar if you’ve played the last two games, but IO Interactive continues to take interesting risks that largely play off while still perfecting the elements that make Hitman so special. The best compliment I can pay Hitman 3 is that I want to finish writing this review so I can go back to playing it.","Hitman 3 is a superb final entry in what must now be regarded as one of gaming's truly great trilogies. This is a fittingly slick and satisfying send off for Agent 47, a succession of expertly crafted and endlessly replayable missions - omitting that final level dud - that sees our favourite assassin wind up his story in triumphantly fine form. IO Interactive really has brought all of their mission crafting expertise to bear here, resulting in a handful of levels that rank with the very best Hitman has to offer, and all while throwing in a couple of genuine curveballs and surprises as they go. This is essential stuff.","If you've played the other two games in the World of Assassination trilogy then you owe it to yourself to finish the narrative in Hitman 3. If not, well, the ability to play all the games in one location makes this an almost essential purchase. If you like sneaking around and playing dress up with guns, Hitman 3 is for you.",,"A high end trilogy, with a high capacity for replayability and majestic scenery.",,,"Hitman 3 features some of the most complex and most creative levels in the series history while polishing the gameplay to perfection. Unfortunately, it's held back by some hefty paywalls, uneven mission pacing, and some occasional clunky AI.",,"If you are looking for the game equivalent of a high-stakes spy thriller, love an equal balance of stealth, action, puzzles and sandbox play, or simply love the fantasy of flying to exotic locations, meeting highly interesting people and killing them, Hitman 3 has your number.","Hitman 3 delivers a very good stealth game which gives complete freedom to the players in expansive and beautiful environments. It unluckily doesn't look as developed in storytelling, and it feels a bit short on content with only 6 environments, though. All in all, a game every stealth lover will surely appreciate.","Hitman 3 is the ultimate experience to enjoy the history of Agent 47. The level design and small playable enhancements make this title a must play for stealth lovers. In addition, having all the content of the previous deliveries improved is the perfect example of how to offer a complete experience.","All in all, IO Interactive has stuck with what it knows best with Hitman 3: gorgeously crafted open playgrounds for the player to wreak slick and murderous havoc in. There’s not much new here if you’re a fan of the series, but IOI didn’t really need to introduce any new mechanics to what was already a fantastic stealth experience. Agent 47’s final outing of the trilogy is his best thanks to updated and improved visuals, a fitting end to the story, and more superb sandbox level design. Sure, it could have done with maybe a different couple of tutorial missions to keep things interesting for the Hitman vets and the achievement hunting community, but other than that, there’s not much else to fault with the game. Hitman 3 is a must-play for all gamers.",,"The third act is often the hardest, and with Hitman 3, IO Interactive has managed, somehow, to mix things up and make it feel fresh. Some will celebrate the lengthier, curated stories, but those who love Hitman for its replay value will be slightly dismayed at Hitman 3. Nonetheless, it's still a great bloody video game.",,,,,,,,,,,,"There are grand moments that will leave you enthralled, from the Knives Out-esque murder mystery to skydiving to one of the tallest buildings in Dubai. The environments are also a highlight as they’re not only a visual treat, but contain an incredible amount of detail that encourage creativity from the player. Unfortunately, there are hang ups that drag the experience down. The focus on the rushed story has taken a toll on at least two missions, while the CG cutscenes are awkwardly done. The decrease of Mission Stories down to between zero and three is a huge blow as they used to offer some of most entertaining ways in getting close to your target. The whole point of the Hitman games is replaying missions over and over again, but after completing one a couple of times, I felt like I experienced everything it had to offer, which isn’t something I had a problem with in the past. There are standout moments, but Hitman 3 just doesn’t have the same charm it did in the last two games, and the limitations only contribute to this. It’s more Hitman, but at the same time less of Hitman.",,,"If you’ve played one of these games before and somehow didn’t like it, Hitman 3 isn’t likely to change your mind. But it does what it does incredibly well, and is a perfected version of this iteration of Hitman. Truly, I don’t see where they could further refine these games without making more sweeping changes, and I have to imagine that’s what’s next for the team at IO.",,,,"HITMAN 3 is a satisfying conclusion to the World of Assassination trilogy, but makes a few missteps that make the game feel less impactful. This game is a must-buy for any Agent 47 fanatics and is a promising sign that Hitman is still relevant in the modern games industry.",,,Hitman 3 brings to a close one of gaming's great trilogies with one last display of immaculate level design and intoxicating mood from IO Interactive. Hitman 3 feels like the culmination of years of work for IO Interactive.,"This is one of the best games in the Hitman franchise and definitely the best game in the ""World of Assassination"" Trilogy by IO Interactive. This is a must play for anyone into Hitman and a great ending to Agent 47's story.","Hitman 3 takes the formula in new directions, and will continually surprise you without stepping too far outside the known boundaries.",,,"Hitman 3 is an impressive accomplishment. Those who've played its two predecessors won’t be surprised in the slightest by how excellent this game is. The World of Assassination trilogy’s brand of emergent gameplay and social stealth in dense, masterfully designed maps has been taken to its zenith in its final instalment, to the extent that some of the locations here can easily be called the best locations this series has ever delivered.",,,,"Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is one of the barcoded butcher's best appearances.",,,"Hitman 3 is a satisfying farewell to Agent 47, with stunning locations, and endless opportunities to take out your targets.",,,,,,,,,,,,"HITMAN III is a decidedly epic conclusion to the events established in the first two games. It offers fantastic, well-realised locales with objectives that are unconventional, at least by HITMAN standards, to come out feeling fresh. Though in pursuit of this, it has lost a bit of the breadth we've come to expect from the series. Ultimately, it delivers what it promised to - a strong conclusion to the trilogy.",,,Hitman III is one of the first strong cards of the year. IO Interactive has given us an entertaining experience focused on experimentation and replayability that no fan of the stealth genre can miss.,,,,"Hitman 3 is an excellent end to the World of Assassination trilogy. Each mission feels dramatically different with exceptional level design that provides countless mysteries to uncover and options to play with. The story comes to a gratifying conclusion, but even if you’re new to 47’s world of slick kills and dark comedy, there has never been a more appropriate time to take aim.",,,,,,,"Hitman 3 is not just the final chapter in the trilogy for the series' fans; it's also a gateway for newcomers, who have an opportunity to experiment with its best version here. The story isn't the strong point, and even though it doesn't introduce many levels, they're all exhilarating, incredibly detailed and varied, with a range of challenges that make you go back, again and again, to complete the puzzles in different ways, expressing all your macabre creativity.",,,,,,"All told, though, Hitman 3 is one of the best stealth games ever made. Those that have enjoyed the last two games in the rebooted trilogy will find more to appreciate here, while newcomers to the franchise will get a highly replayable romp through expertly crafted levels. The disjointed narrative may be off-putting to some, but those willing to overlook the shortcomings of the story are getting an otherwise near-perfect stealth game with exceptional replay value and astounding visual fidelity.",,,,,,,,,"Without straying far from the successful sandbox formula, it's an excellent final part of IO's trilogy. While the increased freedom and level variety won't be for everyone, Hitman 3 boasts some of the best locations and stories the series has ever seen, and there's so much to uncover in each and every one of them.",,,,,,,,"Hitman 3 is a real sandbox dream with its cool, new VR mode, but it unfortunately turns out to be very short.",,,,,,,"A fine and fitting send-off for gaming’s slickest, most inventive thriller.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hitman 3 succeeds in every respect by being a fantastic ending to an already great series. It's also a joy to see that IO Interactive ensured players would be able to slip right back into the shoes of a veteran killer,but didn't rest on their laurels by not offering anything new. Although the touches of permanent shortcuts and new gadgets may seem small, once implemented it's hard to imagine playing without them as they integrate seamlessly into mission stories. Add to that the same freedom to approach a hit that the series is famous for, as well as ensuring every playground looks absolutely stunning and its clear that even without good friends, Agent 47 really does find the perfect blend.",,,,,,"Agent 47 adds some more amazing hits in this fantastic ending of an incredible trilogy. Although there’s not much new mechanically in Hitman 3, you’ll come across some great new experiences along your travels from Dubai through the Carpathian mountains, that may rival the ones in Hitman 2016’s Sapienza.",,,,Hitman 3 takes everything good about the rebooted series and combines it with worthwhile features and levels that are more interactive than ever before to create one of the best stealth games of the last decade.,,,"So it’s 5 levels really, but they are excellent levels, masterful executions of a brilliant concept by a team at the top of their game. And, on top of that, we’ve already got the other two games—which are available for dirt cheap, now—to make a single, expansive, globetrotting experience that sees our familiar, baldheaded puppetmaster accessing the world’s ultra-wealthy just when they thought they were invincible, dancing through the class divides like the nameless angel of death that he is, and then blowing someone up with an exploding golf ball or something.",,,,,,,,,"Hitman 3 doesn’t bring any substantial changes to the tried and true mechanics of the trilogy, but instead offers the most complete, refined version of Agent 47 we’ve seen to date. Despite a lackluster story, IO Interactive has otherwise done an outstanding job over the years with this trilogy and Hitman 3 represents the culmination of all those efforts.","Hitman 3 is full of surprises beneath its familiar systems. It manages to break out of its own sandbox without disrupting its formula too much, ending on a subtle note that brings the world of assassination saga to a satisfying end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The British studio unveils here a magnificent epic which, admittedly, may lack originality in substance, but charms in its form. In addition to enjoying spectacular clashes, the action / adventure game takes you on a journey by revealing an inspired universe. All in nuances, the world of Death's Door is constantly highlighted by its varied artistic direction, its rhythmic sound-design and its characters torn between life and death.

tales-of-arise,"Tales of Arise is not only now my favorite Tales game to date, even surpassing my beloved Vesperia, it’s easily in my top 3 JRPG’s of all time, deserving to be compared to and alongside the best of the genre, and hands down my Game of the Year pick for 2021 without any hesitation. A compelling and complex story, wonderful character development, addictive combat, plenty of side activities to partake in like fishing or farming, stunning visuals and perfect audio are just a few reasons I can’t recommend it enough. Tales of Arise was an unforgettable masterpiece that I’ll surely play through again on NG+ eventually and anyone that’s a JRPG fan needs to play, the sooner the better.","Tales of Arise is a JRPG that ticks a lot of boxes of what I expect and what I want such a game to be. It has a great story, great characters, wonderful designed areas that are vibrant and a combat system you can tailor to your preference. It proves not every RPG needs to be open world and if you do all the other elements very well then it makes for a great experience.",,,"Tales of Arise is great at almost everything it attempts, but it does just falls short of having the wow factor and possesses a couple of niggling factors to boot.

halo-infinite,"Playable on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox Cloud Streaming and even via Game Pass, there’s virtually no borders to prevent you from playing Halo Infinite and experiencing this evolution of the series. I absolutely enjoyed my time stepping back into Chief’s shoes, and I wasn’t sure how connected or how much I would care about new characters, The Pilot and The Weapon, but by the time the credits rolled, I really quite enjoyed The Weapon, making for a fine replacement for Cortana in her own right. As a Halo campaign, this is easily my favorite since Reach and right up there with the best of the series. Get your favorite weapon and finish the fight, Chief.","343i are trading heavily on Halo nostalgia with Infinite, and for the first time since taking over the series they have delivered a game that can easily stand shoulder to shoulder with the Bungie originals. The combat is excellent, it looks stunning, the hits of nostalgia at points are perfectly placed, and outside of the lack of co-op for now, this is exactly what I’d expect from a new Halo game.","Halo Infinite handles the burden of the franchise’s long history gracefully. At times, as with the campaign’s story, it can feel like developer 343 Industries is weighed down by Master Chief’s Mjolnir armor. But Infinite’s bolder design choices, like its open-world environment and Grappleshot, make it feel exciting and new. The multiplayer might play it a little safe to appease longtime fans, but if the worst thing you can say about it is that it feels like old-school Halo, then it’s doing something right. It’s Halo made for Halo fans, but there’s enough novelty to keep it feeling fresh.","Halo Infinite feels like a big step forward for the franchise, a slick shift into the open world arena that manages to strike a fine balance between the traditional narrative-driven Halo of old and all-new levels of freedom and emergent gameplay. It's not all perfect, the story fizzles out a little as it goes on and Zeta Halo isn't the most technically proficient open world we've experienced, but the amazing combat here smooths over most of these minor cracks. Halo's action has truly never felt better, and with an almost endless supply of enemies to engage with in the campaign and a stellar multiplayer package to get stuck into, this is one super-satisfying return for the Master Chief.","Despite falling into some of the same traps as its predecessor, Halo Infinite is a huge step in the right direction and something of a correction course. Overall 343 Industries have delivered on their promise to return Halo to its roots, whilst breaking new ground, and it’s much better off for it.","Halo Infinite is a true return to form for the series with simple aesthetics, a stoic character and a lonely quiet story reminiscence of the original Halo game. With the exceptional addition of the grappleshot refreshing the classic Halo formula, this is a very bold new step for the Halo universe.","Halo Infinite is a much needed reinvention of the franchise. Its campaign mode makes it the most ambitious, fun and complete Halo of them all. This edition is a love letter to fans and a true gift for the newcomers. Undoubtedly, one of the best games of the generation, and a true gem not to be missed.","The Master Chief is back with 343i’s best Halo so far. Infinite delivers a fantastic campaign with solid gunplay that we have thoroughly enjoyed. Even with some flaws and the lack of co-op modes, Halo Infinite is a game you cannot miss.","Halo Infinite marks a clear moment in 343 Studios’ handling of the series. They finally have a grasp on what makes Master Chief tick, and they bring all of that knowledge to bear in often-spectacular fashion. While some issues nag, it’s clear that Halo Infinite is a brilliant new entry in the series, and one that makes this particular sci-fi FPS relevant once again.","Halo Infinite is a phenomenal game that completely exceeded my expectations. By seamlessly blending exciting new elements with Halo's traditional formula, 343 Industries has crafted its magnun opus.",,"Halo Infinite brings together the best gameplay elements from the Bungie Halo era, doubles down on Halo CE’s sandbox environments to encompass its entire open world structure and brings new gameplay mechanics that will no doubt become a permanent part of its design document going forward, making it an experience no shooter fan can afford to miss.","Halo Infinite is 100% classic Halo, even with innovations like the grappling hook and the open-world structure that, in fact, leverage the very elements that made the series a great video game classic. 343 Industries has nailed game structure, gameplay, gunplay, AI, graphics and music, but stumbled with inexcusable flaws - especially after such a long wait - in variety and replayability. The game will still keep you glued to the controller though, so there's little doubt: Master Chief is back and he's in great shape.","Halo Infinite is the best game from 343 Industries, and probably the best game of the Master Chief: an epic journey, full of emotion, joy, and, of course, a marvelous soundtrack that make us connect with our beloved Master Chief and his new companions. Everyone who loves Halo, must play Halo Infinite.","Moment-to-moment gameplay in Halo Infinite feels fantastic, so it's just a bit of a shame that there isn't more to do with those tight mechanics right now. Multiplayer is superb but you likely already know that, and with that element being free-to-play anyway, there's a massive question mark hanging over whether that should even be considered part of the core experience. The open world setting both giveth and taketh away, but I think it works for the most part, and fair play to the team for trying something new. Right now, it's a damn good game... but when it eventually catches up to its ambitions, it could wind up being something much more impressive.",,"While Halo Infinite's campaign structure is new territory for the series, and will likely divide opinion, it tells a good story, and creates moments that rank it in the top half when it comes to good Halo campaigns. Throw in a phenomenal multiplayer arena and some stellar shooter mechanics, and it's safe to say that 343 has finally put its stamp on the wonderful world of Halo.","True, in the collective subconscious, Halo has always been a first person shootout set in large environments. But Infinite finally delivers a vision of what Master Chief can give inside a universe that lives up to its reputation. As well as bearing little in the way of his tumultuous development, the game manages to make John-117 so fun to play that it's hard to let go of the pad once the campaign begins. Whether during confrontation or in the exploration phases, the title of 343 Industries is appealing. However, once the campaign is over, we can only regret the absence of different biomes and the scarcity of truly epic sequences. Elements which have nevertheless been the hallmark of the series for twenty years! In short, we gain in freedom of action what we lose in spectacle. With such successful main mechanics, we would have liked an even more ambitious campaign, period.",,Halo Infinite is an unexpectedly surprising game capable of mixing the past and the future of the series. There are still some refinements to be made but this is only the beginning of an epic adventure.,,,"Halo: Infinite delivers an amazing entry into the franchise. While it doesn’t manage to take the top spot on my personal list of favorite Halo games(Remember Reach!) it is easily in my top three. And with Xbox looking to keep players engaged with Xbox Game Pass I can only imagine that we will be getting more stories with the Chief as he continues his fight against the Banished. If 343 Industries can keep what comes next to the same level of fun and polish they have established here, I will gladly pick up my trusty Battle Rifle anytime they have a new mission for me.",,"Halo Infinite isn’t a perfect game. It has some rough edges, and you can absolutely feel at times where compromises had to be made to get it out this holiday season. Normally I’d want a game to take its time and release when it’s ready, but this is a case where I’m glad the developers didn’t do so. A year from now, Halo Infinite may be even better than it is today, but right now, it’s still one of the best games of 2021. After many years of trying to find its footing, Halo is back on solid ground. While in the long term, a series of this age will need to try innovating again, after years of struggling to find the right feel, letting players come home to a game that simply feels like a modern version of what they love was the right choice.","Despite the fact that Halo Infinite has many negative elements in it, it manages to provide an amazing experience.","After years of absence, Halo is back. And how. With a thrilling campaign, 343 Industries captures that feeling of old-school Halo, whilst adding to the formula. The new open-world structure is a lighter version of what we know from the genre, but the addicting gameplay makes the whole experience feel truly remarkable. And that feeling extends to the multiplayer. There are some technical points that do need some refinement, but overall Halo Infinite is a solid new entry in the iconic franchise.","Halo Infinite is not a revolution in video games, but neither does it seek to. Its mission is to be a game of the highest level and update the Master Chief to bring it back to the forefront of relevance, and that is achieved with a cocktail of excellent gameplay, sensitivity to new trends in the industry and a huge affection for everything built by the saga to this day.",,,"After 20 years of good and loyal service, the Major proves once again that the saga is far from over. While keeping the DNA of the previous episodes in its scenario, Halo Infinite introduces a new dynamic into the series with the addition of the semi-open world. Exploration is enhanced, partly thanks to an intelligent level design that allows you to choose from numerous paths and especially by the grappling hook, allowing for better movement and fight alternatives. Thanks to a brilliant soundtrack and a qualitative French dubbing, we take great pleasure in exploring the Halo Zeta to eliminate the Banished despite some technical shortcomings.",,,"Even after dozens of hours, the dance of movement and gunplay still feels wonderful to perform. It’s not a revolutionary redo of Halo’s principles, but rather, a refreshing revival that’s come at the perfect time.","Halo Infinite is at its best when sticking to the basics. The shooting feels fantastic, especially when paired with the new Grappleshot, and its story is well written and engaging, even if it lacks an epic conclusion to sign off the 343 Industries trilogy in style. But while I’m happy to see 343 Industries experimenting with new ideas, I’m not a fan of the open-world format, which feels generic and features repetitive objectives. Fortunately, this doesn’t negatively impact the more linear missions, so you’re still getting the classic Halo experience for the most part. It’s the multiplayer that’s the main highlight for Halo Infinite though. It doesn’t really bring anything new to the series, but its superb gunplay and simplicity make it hugely enjoyable.",343i had failed to live up to the high bar set by Bungie — until now. It was worth the wait to see Master Chief return in such an impressive manner and I am once again excited for the future of this franchise. The multiplayer and campaign combine to make a stellar experience.,"Halo Infinite isn’t perfect. It has foibles and struggles here and there. But it’s also a slam dunk of a release; it’s exactly what Halo needs to be now. As Halo’s relevance has felt to wane over recent years, this is a bold statement that, no, Halo isn’t ‘over’. It was never close. It matters, and it’s still brilliant. I don’t mind waiting to see where updates take it, because what’s here at launch is already largely brilliant. I’m excited for the future of Halo again.","Master Chief’s latest adventure is by far the best game by 343 Industries yet, and gives the series the much needed boost to get back on top of the shooter genre. With a sandbox gameplay, advanced enemy AI and a great narration, Halo Infinite is a worthy sequel to Bungie’s trilogy and promises a bright future for the Halo franchise.",,"While the story is weird and convoluted, the gameplay of both it's single-player and multi-player modes makes Halo Infinite the best shooter of 2021. Quite frankly it might be the best shooter of the past couple of years.","Halo Infinite on the Xbox Series X is classic Halo fun that has received a true next-gen makeover that really upgrades our favourite Spartan, the Master Chief himself!","Halo Infinite's compendium is a remarkable one, a game that excels in all areas and that properly shows the hard work that 343 Industries has put in the game. The campaign is cool and the multiplayer is lots of fun, so all in all John 117's first appearance in the next-gen is a fantastic one.","Halo Infinite is a shining example of what a Halo game is at its core while simultaneously feeling fresh, invigorated and very modern.","Taken as a whole, Halo Infinite is an amazing package.","Taking both single and multiplayer as a whole, Halo Infinite marks a return to form for a franchise that is in desperate need of one. Its open-world may feel a tad formulaic, but it also houses plenty of emergent gameplay opportunities while continuing to offer huge set-pieces…Multiplayer battle pass progression aside, playing with friends in Halo Infinite feels closer to the glory days of Halo 3 than ever. If you'd been concerned based on prior showings, you can put those concerns to rest – Halo is back, and it might just be better than ever.","If the campaign will continue to be built upon with similarly intimate stories revolving around Master Chief and The Weapon then I cannot wait to see them, since the potential here for expansion is limitless. Multiplayer is spectacular, even as it struggles with teething issues associated with becoming a live-service model. At its core the punchy gunplay, reactive movement, and reliance on teamwork remains, and that’s all Halo Infinite needs to become a winner. As someone who grew up as a blubbering fangirl, it feels so good to see Master Chief deliver an adventure that is once again worthy of his iconic status.",Halo Infinite celebrates a 20-year legacy with style and smartly outlines the foundations for future expansion – and it's the best Halo has been in quite some time.,"Halo Infinite's single-player campaign is exactly what this series needed. It brings out the best in Master Chief's unique and satisfying combat style while leveraging old ideas to create memorable new moments. Its story falls short for both new and veteran players, but it was worth the six-year wait.","With Halo Infinite, 343 has finally surpassed the high-points from Bungie’s reign over the Halo Franchise. It was worth the wait to see the Master Chief return in such a spectacular fashion.","Halo Infinite's move to a more open-world structure feels like a new beginning for the series, with nostalgic nods and fresh introductions combining to great effect. Both the campaign and multiplayer have room for improvement, but the core experience is strong.","Halo Infinite is a great example of gameplay being king. Moreish, exciting combat is only let down by a fairly safe open world and lack of essential feeling abilities and upgrades.","As a restart of the series, Halo: Infinite delivered a stellar performance with a newly designed single player campaign and a steady multiplayer mode. It retains the core fun of the series, and also takes a solid and steady step forward on the road of gameplay exploration. In the 20th year of the Halo series, Halo: Infinite breathes new life into the series with solid content, careful innovation and time-tested design.",,"It expands Halo's gameplay frontiers while making us feel ""just like home"" with similar sensations to those of the franchise beginnings.","Halo Infinite is a sequence of Greatest Halo Hits, stitched together with an open Ring world. The game offers a level of action that only the early parts can compete with in sheer fun. Ignore the 'call to duty' and ignore the 'battlefields': in the 26th century, Halo Infinite is where the shooter action of the year is.","The game lets you live and relive the best moments of the Halo series whenever you want, whether it’s playing getaway driver for a botched base attack, a pilot abandoning ship after an impromptu dogfight, falling from the air to strike at enemies below with a hammer like Thor, or being the platoon leader of a ragtag group of soldiers cautiously navigating Zeta Halo’s vast, Pacific Northwest-inspired forests. ... Finally, a Halo experience once again remembers that the player is not meant to look into Master Chief’s eyes, purposely anonymous, hidden behind his visor helmet; we are meant to look through them.",,"At the moment the Infinite campaign indicates a direction, a landing point: it is a very solid even if at times imperfect departure, which however will not fail to leave ecstatic the veterans of the saga and the curious who will approach Halo only thanks to this chapter.",,"Like many, I’m sad that Halo Infinite doesn’t offer cooperative multiplayer at launch, if only because it’s been a bulwark of the series’ identity. It’s a disappointing omission, but I have to judge the game before me, not the features I wish might be there. And by that measure, Halo Infinite is a rousing success. Whether you want a big, mysterious sci-fi adventure or a chance to engage with some intense PvP, Halo Infinite nails the shots where it counts and heralds a new era for one of gaming’s most recognizable mainstays.","Master Chief has returned, but our adventures on Zeta Halo left us with mixed feelings. The gameplay is truly phenomenal and the grapple hook, in particular, steals the show. But the game is, after an extra year of development, still not finished. The single-player is not memorable, the surroundings are repetitive and the game is on a technical level very unpolished. While we have a tremendous amount of fun with the multiplayer, 343 Industries just doesn’t meet the mark with this Halo installment.","The main campaign of Halo Infinite has a bunch of problems: the AI that manages the friendly marines is underwhelming and the level design of the missions is sometimes repetitive. But as soon as you start firing, the game is simply perfect and this is what counts in a first person shooter.","With an adventurous campaign, complete with a sandbox that’ll still be there when your friends can join the fight, and a multiplayer suite that feels like a note-perfect revival of the Halo of old, Halo Infinite feels like the complete blockbuster sci-fi shooter we’ve been waiting for from 343 Industries. It hasn’t happened overnight for the team, but the mantle passed to them, at last, feels earned.",Halo Infinite will be loved by its fans as well as newcomers as it is a breath of fresh air in the campaign and multiplayer modes.,"I grew up with Halo, so despite the bad presentation of 2020, I still had hopes that Halo Infinite would be a big comeback for the series, but in all fairness I can't say that it is. Let's be clear: it is a solid and fun game in its fundamental mechanics, also capable of inserting novelties that work (from the open world to the grappleshot) and that I would like to see carried out. At the same time it pays the price of a troubled development, probably a result of the uncertainty with which 343 Industries is handling the series from Halo 4 onwards. A well-defined gameplay, and embellished with some changes that refine the formula a little, is used to carry on a story with a few memorable moments and that still has everything to prove.","I am very happy to tell you that Halo: Infinite is the Halo that we have been waiting for and that shows that indeed, 343 Industries is the indicated study to continue with the Master Chief legacy and that most likely, this new formula that integrates an open world in campaign, be the way to go for future installments. While the way his story is told is unfriendly to newcomers, I would tell you that you will still find a great FPS in case you never gave John 117 a chance, and if you are one of the old veterans Well, fasten your seatbelt well, an authentic journey full of emotions awaits you that will surely return you to the most memorable moments of this super iconic franchise. Xbox is Halo and Halo is Xbox.","343 Industries made an amazing job in making Halo: Infinite feel new and captivating, yet familiar for long time fans that patiently waited for Master Chief to come back.","Halo Infinite is a great FPS because it delivers what we expected in every way and, while it has some flaws, it keeps an outstanding quality throughout the entire experience.","Often we're reminded of one of the oldest, simplest examples of Halo's sandbox: what happens when one grenade is applied to an unexploded stack of its peers. A cascade of possibilities, all these tiny moments of pleasure bouncing off of one another in a way that could never be fully scripted in advance. [Issue#367, p.98]",,"Halo Infinte is a fresh new start for the series, one that promises good things to come. The open world means new ways of playing and with the new hookshot it sure is a pleasure to explore the huge surfaces. Unfortunately, there are still many empty areas, something that probably will change in the future. Gameplay is top notch though. Now only the last pieces of the puzzle are missing, parts that could make Halo Infinite the very best of its kind.","Halo Infinite is a Halo game through and through, and probably the closest 343i have been at capturing the same magic that Bungie did all those years ago.",Quotation forthcoming.,"We’ve got a classic and reverent Halo experience that embraces modern ideas where it makes sense. Perhaps I’m showing my age, but this is pretty much just what I want in a Halo game — or at least it will be with the eventual addition of a co-operative campaign mode and some multiplayer tweaks. Add in the fact that it’s included with Xbox Game Pass when it launches on December 8 — bringing millions of subscribers into the fold from day one — and Halo Infinite is clearly going to be the game to play on Xbox platforms for the foreseeable future.","At launch, Halo Infinite is a somewhat uneven bundle. The multiplayer is outstanding, and free to all players, even those without a Game Pass subscription. It recaptures that classic Halo magic from the early 2000’s, and has managed to inch out its competitors with its cleverly re-imagined gameplay. The campaign is less consistent, and harder to recommend unless you are really itching for yet another Chief/Cortana story. It’s a step up from Halo 5, absolutely, but its experiment with a larger map doesn’t quite land as well as it should. There are few memorable moments throughout, but its excellent gunplay makes it worth a try, even if you just mainline your way through the story missions.","The bizarrely structured and frequently uninteresting story campaign threatens to undermine the multiplayer, but this is still easily the best Halo has been for over a decade.","A must for fans and recommended for newcomers, Halo Infinite may not be the epic experience everyone's been waiting for, but there's no doubt about it - it's an incredibly solid foundation for the future of Master Chief. 343 Industries assembled the canvas and painted the outlines. Now all that's left is to fill in the painting.",Halo Infinite recovers all the epic feel of the first installments in a title that seems to want to act as a connection with the future of the saga.,,,,Halo Infinite is the game that the series needed. 343 Industries returns to the roots with a new chapter of Master Chief that fans will love both in campaign and multiplayer.,,Halo Infinite is definitely one of the best releases of this year. And now we will patiently wait to see where the game goes next with future updates.,,"It’s very much the spiritual successor it purports to be -- with forward thinking design and elements that flow in a way that reminds you of the timeless nature of the fluid, stylish combat of old. The lack of co-op is something you feel, but in terms of cinematic spectacle this is the Master Chief carrying the flag once more for Xbox. Albeit in that new-school form of being able to jump in and, well, play anywhere.","Halo Infinite is definitely the game that will make 343 Industries. After a few rocky attempts, this is a fun and much needed return to form for the franchise. While the campaign feels a little empty, there’s huge potential for things to come in DLC and despite some of the issues with multiplayer, the core gameplay itself is extremely enjoyable. I look forward to seeing where 343 takes the series from here.","Master Chief is back for its fans, with some great new gameplay and a solid multiplayer. They will also enjoy the ""good old times"" aspects of the story, probably more than newcomers will. They also might be frustrated that the ambitious narration kinda falls short, ending when it should really start.","Halo Infinite clearly marks a return to form for the Halo Franchise. The feeling is there, the music is there and the setting is there too. And 343 manages to make the game feel familiar all the while adding some new, and welcome, features. Halo Infinite also feels like the most intimate Master Chief story yet. It's just too bad that gamers will now have to wait for months to be able to play the campaign in coop, a staple of the series.",,"It's plausible Halo Infinite will eventually become an era-defining game, one that reestablishes it as a dominant shooter franchise, but it's not there yet and there's no telling when it will be.",This is the evolution the series needed and provides a promising foundation for the future of the series.,"After the disappointing Halo 5: Guardians, it really does feel like 343 Industries is getting the series back on track with Halo Infinite. The setting is familiar, and so is the gameplay, but like returning to your hometown to meet up with long-lost friends, it’s a wholesome experience and, once you scratch the surface, things are different enough to allay any fears that you’re just re-treading the same old ground. Perhaps the biggest shame is that co-op won’t be available until after launch, because those open areas could really do with multiple Spartans causing havoc in them. But until then, even playing solo is bound to be captivating thanks to firefights that put most other first-person shooters to shame.","Halo Infinite strives to transform what it means to be a Halo game, making Chief into a reluctant father figure for a young and naive AI and putting him into an open-world setting. It turns out that was a risk worth taking for the franchise, as Infinite is an incredible game. Certain story elements are on the weaker side and the amazing Grappleshot makes the rest of Chief's equipment feel a bit lacking in comparison, but these are small shortcomings in what otherwise feels like the best Halo campaign in years and an excellent evolution of what Halo can be.",,"Does Halo Infinite give us a graphic slap worthy of a new generation title? Outside of the cutscenes, not really. Does Halo Infinite offer us an innovative open world? No, the recipe could not be more classic. But Halo Infinite remains one of the best episodes of the saga, which it significantly enriches while offering more tactical combat than ever, the latter requiring the player to constantly adapt to the current situation.","Halo Infinite is a very good game with effective gameplay and a very immersive universe. We appreciate the freedom offered in the world that we take pleasure in discovering thanks to the use of the grapple. The progress of Spartan is satisfactory and the fights are nerve-wracking. However, the sets are not varied enough to travel completely and the activities are repetitive which makes the whole a bit redundant. But what is missing the most are great epic moments that could have made it an unforgettable Halo.",,"It has taken over six years for Halo Infinite to release, but after such a long wait, 343 has given fans the game that they've been holding out for. Although it might not win many points for originality, the latest entry in Xbox's flagship franchise has again verified why Halo is one of the most popular gaming properties on the planet. Even though this series is now two decades old, Halo Infinite proves that there is still plenty of creative juice left in the tank to make Halo feel fresh and relevant in the modern landscape. In simplest terms, Halo is back.","Halo Infinite's campaign and multiplayer will delight fans especially, but the dreary hub world is hardly motivating.","From the first few minutes, it's noticeable that 343 Industries poured its heart into the Halo Infinite campaign. Everything looks cared for, greatly detailed, and it offers an unbeatable experience in Xbox Series. At times it feels like some additional game mode is missing, but that doesn't mean that the title isn't enjoyable. It's a must-buy and a game that will be worthwhile to play on more than one occasion.","Halo Infinite brings the series back to where it started twenty years ago. Back to the lone super soldier, a chatty AI companion and shootings that are bound to lead to a delicious chaos of colorful explosions and screaming aliens. Back to a surprisingly smooth-playing multiplayer, where thanks to the same chaos no two games are the same. Back to a game we want to keep playing indefinitely.","If I had one piece of advice for people on the fence with Halo Infinite, it would be to not worry about the open world and embrace how it's handled here.","Halo Infinite offers a brief campaign with uneven writing, and a functional but safe implementation of the new open-world levels. It's still a great shooter with strong core mechanics that help carry the experience, but as multiplayer is now standalone and free, the value proposition of this full priced solo adventure is rather diluted.","Halo Infinite delivers stunning firefights and a great shooter-mechanic. Yet, the single-player experience suffers from the lifeless and uninspired open-world.",,"Still, there is something to be said for focusing on what you are good at. And in both Halo Infinite’s campaign and its superb multiplayer...343 are proving masters of the art of battle.",,"Halo Infinite isn't going to reinvent the shooter genre, but it's a fun solo and multiplayer experience that can only get better with time.","With Halo Infinite, 343 Industries seems to want to break the cycle and start afresh. The irony is that it has done so by drawing closer to the past.","You could argue that Master Chief is the necessary foil to Halo’s inherent silliness, the gravelly undertone that ties all the pratfalls together. All the same, he and his inability to get over Cortana have long since lost their charm. The series has tried to move away from him before – in that regard, Halo 3: ODST remains its finest hour. It needs to carry on trying.",,"Consider me a Halo fan now. I was never really looking forward to Infinite. But now that it's here, it's so much more than what I was expecting.","If Doom Eternal is a cheeseburger and fries at In-n-Out, then Halo Infinite is a steak dinner in the big city with an overpriced bottle of luscious red wine. It is buff grandpa showing the young hotshot how it’s done because he invented the game.","Halo Infinite's campaign sets the stage for an incredible sequel someday. Today is not that day. Consider this a fine rental or excuse to burn through a single month of Xbox Game Pass, either now or whenever the co-op mode finally goes live in 2022.","The important core essentials have been nailed, though. After six years, 343 Industries could not afford another miss and with Infinite it has built some incredibly strong foundations for whatever comes next. The team clearly now understands what this series is – the shooting, the flow of combat and movement, the character of Master Chief and his closest companions, and a totally new structure to catalyse some monumental silliness. It recaptures the old, adds the new, and we now can’t wait for the future.","Somewhere between those map icons is tantalising mystery, and that's what Silent Cartographer was all about, wasn't it? Being on an alien world, not knowing the whys or the hows or the whos. Working things out while finishing the fight. Halo Infinite, underneath it all, is about just that. And, if nothing else, you can always rely on that golden triangle - Master Chief and his gun, grenade and Gravity Hammer - this time on your own terms, the best it's been in a decade.","I do know this: As a longtime Halo devotee, it is so, so good to be back to a Halo that genuinely feels like a Halo. I’ve been playing these games for, f.ck, man, two decades now. Time was, somewhere in the era before (and momentarily after) Halo 5, I could picture myself hitting a point where I was take-it-or-leave-it on the series. Now? Absolutely not.","In some ways, the grappling hook feels like a perfect microcosm of Halo Infinite as a whole. It’s an addition that somehow shakes things up while also feeling like it belonged the entire time. In Halo Infinite’s design tenets and its iconic characters, 343 Industries has created something that bears the weight of the Halo legacy, and it’s poised to carry that weight into the future. It’s invigorating to be so excited about Halo again. [Polygon Recommends]","343 Industries has laid some really solid groundwork here and deserves a lot of credit for managing to modernize the series while focusing on what people loved most about it. At this point, though, it’s not so much a reinvention as simply a very good Halo campaign.",,,,"Halo Infinite is an absolute delight of a first person shooter, and king in the sandbox field. The shaping of human, believable characters is something you can take for granted with 343 Industries in charge too. The one thing that's missing here is the courage to do something beyond replicating what best defines this IP —that being imaginative, immersive levels [Recommended].",,,,"Halo is back to its best with Halo Infinite, tight controls, and seriously thirst-quenching gunplay that feels so intuitively satisfying. Traversal has been improved hugely by the addition of the grappleshot, allowing Master Chief to zip around at speed, as well as adding a unique element for multiplayer matches. A particular dampener has to be directed at the online multiplayer, which is riddled with cheaters, but, if they were to be removed then the multiplayer offers a solid free-to-play experience that is fast and frantic. Halo Infinite, alongside a number of other Xbox first-party titles is a great addition to Xbox Game Pass, and it is certainly a marquee game that warrants a subscription to the service.",,,,,,,"Celebrating its 20th anniversary, it feels almost poetic that Halo Infinite is its biggest, boldest, and most creative launch since the series released. Bringing a return to form for both the campaign and multiplayer, the entire experience is a Halo tour de force for the Xbox brand.",,,,,,"Halo Infinite might be the best campaign 343 has done, but considering I didn’t love the last two, I’m not sure how much weight that carries. Halo Reach remains the gold standard for me in that department, and while I had a lot of fun here zipping around the open world, and I can see the potential of the concept, something about Infinite feels small and unfinished to me compared to both other Halo campaigns, and other open world titles. I don’t need (or want) a sprawling Assassin’s Creed map that takes 200 hours to clear, but I think I need more diversity than what’s here, and a better story with better characters told within it.",,"Halo Infinite is a quintessential Halo experience. 343 Industries has managed to create a Halo that harkens back to the classics while still ensuring it feels modern without muddying the iconic feel that long-time Halo fans have come to love. For those that follow the narrative closely, the story that is told in Halo Infinite is heartfelt and emotive, and may just bring you to tears. Not only does Halo Infinite offer a return to greatness, it caps off important stories while introducing new and exciting mysteries. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to experience it in co-op at launch. And even though the multiplayer has some growing pains to work through, it remains an absolute treat to play, especially with a group of friends. Hats off to 343 Industries. The whole team should feel proud because Halo Infinite is an instant classic. Halo’s back, baby!",,,"Overall, Halo Infinite is great but something of a mixed bag. Fans of the genre will certainly enjoy the additional mobility granted by the grappling hook while the rest of the gameplay delivers that well-polished Halo experience that shooter-heads have come to know and love over the decades. It's a bit of a shame that the story doesn't quite stick the landing, but add in the fantastic (and free) multiplayer and you've got a really solid foundation for whatever comes next, be that a story expansion or an eventual full-on sequel.",,"Halo Infinite's campaign closes a few doors and opens some others, and even if the open-world stylings could be better integrated into the overarching gameplay design, it's a title that pays homage to the past while looking to the future. The refined and addictive multiplayer is a certifiable breath of fresh air, even if the menacing wind of microtransactions blows simultaneously.",,,,,,"In the end, it’s hard not to love Halo Infinite, which is easily the most complete game in a franchise that’s long set the bar for gaming. There’s just nothing like playing through an adventure as the Master Chief.","Overall, this is the best day one first-person shooter of the year and will only evolve and improve more as the developers tweak it. You’ve an awesome open world to explore for the first time in the franchise and a top-level multiplayer suite to battle endlessly through during the cold winter months. Well done Xbox.","Halo Infinite is science-fiction storytelling at its best. The best thing about this entry is that it knows what it is. This is a story of a hero, and whether you self-identify with him or not, you’re going to immerse yourself in his resolve. While upgrades and the lack of a co-op campaign limit some enjoyment, this is the game Halo fans have been waiting for. It’s a proud day for Master Chief, but mostly developer 343 Industries, for putting together such a memorable experience.","There’s not much to do in the open world, but thankfully, it doesn’t play a big role either. Infinite mostly sticks to what makes Halo great: first-person action. Smart level design, great mobility mechanics like grappling hook, and good AI make for some really memorable moments. [Issue#258, p.42]","Halo Infinite is a successful Microsoft experiment. You will not experience a gram of revolution here - it's just a safe evolution with respect to the source material, but all in all: why change something that works? The open world is rather an addition for those who are interested - it does not spoil what has always been the best in Halo, i.e. the epic story and dynamic action. Even the graphics that would not knock you down and on PS4, not to mention the new generation, screams straight: Infinite is an old school game. And in fact, it is such a gate that takes us back into the ancient times - which can be seen as both an advantage and a disadvantage.","Given the slow burn recession the series has experienced over the past decade, it's impossible to read Halo Infinite as anything other than a shocking return to form...Single player missions come replete with some of the game's most spectacular set pieces and dramatic boss fights that had my heart exploding out my chest.","It’s a very modern interpretation of what Halo can be, pulling from the kinds of games that are as big today as Halo was when it first launched. Rather that feeling like a Greatest Hits of modern video gaming, though, it still feels distinctly like Halo. Meanwhile, its potential to grow and change seems like it will have a much more lasting impact than any amount of bopping aliens in the head. Maybe “combat evolved” just means something new now.","Halo Infinite didn’t really do it for me. The repetition of stakes and open world activities made the final 15 hours of gameplay something I was actively dreading. At the same time, the first 10 hours or so were exciting and engaging, and I imagine that someone not trying to power through the game in a week to make a review embargo deadline of Sunday night might have a better way of spacing things out. The open world sandbox is truly fun, especially once you have access to flying vehicles late in the game, but there’s only so many hijinks to get up to (at least until the co-op campaign releases). For a game about new possibilities, and titled Infinite, the game’s universe ends up feeling pretty constrained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
monster-hunter-rise,,,,"Monster Hunter Rise is another amazing mainline release in Capcom’s ever-expanding action-RPG series. It brings enough new ideas and mechanics to keep the hunt feeling fresh, and is even better with friends. The setback here is for original players, with no cross-progression features to carry over existing save files from the likes of Switch and Steam. As mentioned, there's also limited cross-play, meaning you can’t team up with your friends on rival platforms. Still, what’s here is a great game, and if you have ever wondered what all the fuss is about, Rise is a great entry point into the Monster Hunter franchise.","Monster Hunter Rise isn’t quite Monster Hunter: World. And that’s partly because Rise doesn’t offer too much in the way of new things, and what is here suffers graphically in comparison.",,"Monster Hunter Rise looks spectacular on Xbox and it shows that despite being a port, its improvements are significant in terms of textures, frames and resolution. It’s great to have a port that has what it takes to deviate slightly from its original release on Nintendo Switch.",,,,,,,"Monster Hunter Rise has innovated the classic formula of Capcom's success in all aspects, thus achieving new systems that undoubtedly feel extremely fresh and dynamic. With this in mind I can affirm that this installment is one of the funniest Monster Hunters in the entire saga.","Monster Hunter Rise is a fantastic action game that will keep you busy for hundreds of hours, and the upgrades on Xbox compared to the Switch original are considerable. Veteran hunters might feel like the streamlining has been taken a little too far in places, but Rise does often manage to add different kinds of depth in new ways, even if series fans are unlikely to find too much of a challenge here outside of a few notable quests. The Rampage being something of a chore is a shame, especially with it being a key part of the narrative, but it is what it is and aside from the handful of required quests and a related achievement for running 50(!) of the damn things, you can largely ignore it and enjoy the series' more traditional hunts in typically enjoyable fashion.",,"A deep and colossal monster melee, Monster Hunter Rise is both enormously fun and uniquely rewarding. Snap it up.",,,,"Monster Hunter Rise benefits from a tighter focus and massive quality-of-life improvements over its predecessors. The performance is excellent, and your hunts are more enjoyable than ever. With it releasing day one on Game Pass it’s a world worth visiting by yourself or with some buddies.",,"It makes numerous improvements in how it onboards new players, adds layers to its core combat loop that are difficult to imagine going without now, and does so while staying true to what makes the series so special.",,,,,,,,"What a great episode this Monster Hunter Rise is! Capcom has taken the formula of the massive Monster Hunter World from a few years ago and sprinkled it with improvements to make it even more dynamic. By reducing the number of ingredients needed for crafting and adding various improvements such as the Wirebug, switch skills or even more verticality in the environments, the Japanese developer has certainly refined the already canonical recipe of the previous opus. The cherished universe, the number of new monsters and the ever-present challenge wrap up the list of essential ingredients which, in our opinion, make this Monster Hunter Rise a savoury recipe to success. We are convinced that a sequel could benefit from a few improvements, especially concerning the tracking, which is almost invisible here. Maybe for a Monster Hunter World 2?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In short, Rise is a great iteration on the classic Monster Hunter formula, making things more approachable and getting rid of some of the series’ less desirable elements. They may have made sense in the past, but the removal of much busywork is a net positive in my eyes. It’s a shame that Capcom didn’t include the massive Sunbreak expansion with this release given that it’s already out on Switch and PC, but it’s not like this package is lacking in content or value. For hunters of any experience level, Rise is a great entry in a storied series.",,,,,,"I seriously surprised myself at how much I love Monster Hunter Rise. With a campaign that doesn’t last long, just enough to train players up and then being the real game. The endgame is where it’s at and going after those high-level monsters is such a delight with or without friends playing. Even after all the time I have invested I have yet to see all of the monsters and I can’t wait to continue to discover more and the upcoming Sunbreak expansion coming summer 2023. Yep, seems there has never been a better time for Monster Hunter fans new and old and I am happy to now count myself among them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The load time in the XSX version is lightning fast in single player. I don’t even get the chance to read but about three words of the loading screen descriptions before it switches to the next area. The graphics are equal to the PC version – I compared the two and didn’t see any noticeable differences. The only real flaw with this release is that it doesn’t include the Sunbreaker expansion. It does mention in-game that the Sunbreaker expansion will be coming soon however! If you have yet to experience Monster Hunter Rise, then be sure to try it out on Xbox or PlayStation now since it’s just as good as the PC version overall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Monster Hunter Rise has looked at what did and didn’t work in past entries' gameplay loops, and bridged the gap between with new features in a refreshingly effective way.",,,,,,,,,"A first-class Monster Hunter experience! Sure, its Switch roots are showing, and it's not the most sumptuous game to look at on these new platforms, but Monster Hunter Rise more than makes up for that in the gameplay department.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition,,,,"Age of Empires 2 might be showing its age a little, even with the Definitive makeover, but it is still – and always will be – a timeless classic in the history book of video games, and remains as addictive as ever. It’s amazing to see Microsoft giving Xbox users some much-needed RTS love and going the extra mile with full controller support, despite the fact a few extra things are missing. This release does seem to be just the start of Microsoft’s plans – with Age of Empires IV up next for Xbox. Here’s to the return of the king!","Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition brings a true classic back for a new generation. Whether you are a die hard strategy fan or first time invader, there is no better place to start.",,"Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition lands on Xbox in a big way, with a magnificent adaptation of the controls to console, impressive graphics and all the classic essence of the saga, with hundreds of hours of content and endless battles.",,,"Seriously, if you're the kind of person who loves to think strategically and is interested in history then you'll get sucked into this RTS game. See just why it's been seen as one of the best strategy games of all time.",,"Age of Empires 2: The Definitive Edition has made the transition to console surprisingly well, giving a new range of people a chance to play one of RTS’s most beloved classics in a new way.",,"Age of Empires II Definitive Edition continues to be that real-time strategy experience that we all love, and its recent port for Xbox will see many more players join the large community of fans in love with the franchise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Age of Empires II is a game that forever remains as part of your own existence. It does not matter how much time goes on, in the end you ALWAYS remember having played AOE; it is a timeless classic. You REALLY want to play this new version of the game, whether it is because you want to explore one of the greatest video games ever for the very first time, or because you are an 'old school' player that wants to re-live a glorious age that will no longer come back.",,,,,,,"Not only has Microsoft made one of the best RTS games of all time enjoyable using nothing but a controller, but they have even improved on the original release in some key ways. Age of Empires 2 is just as good as ever on the Xbox and should be a must-play for strategy fans everywhere.",,,"The Xbox version of Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition retains all of the game's content while making huge changes to the operating system and user interface. These changes have greatly reduced the startup threshold and improved the game experience. It is not only a very successful version, but also an excellent answer to the ""can console play RTS"" question.",,"Some features show that the ""base game"" is 2 decades old, but the core experience is still mesmerizing and more accessible than ever.",,,,,,,,"Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition is one of the most popular RTS games of all time. Thanks to a good adaptation that uses shortcuts and an intelligent interface to give players the power to control their empires, we can play it on consoles after almost 25 years. The mouse and keyboard are still better, but this could be the chance for the die-hard fans of the controller to play a true masterpiece.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While one could argue that argue that playing Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition with a controller is needlessly complicated, that would entirely miss the point of a release on console. Consoles tend to draw a more casual-friendly audience that may not have played the original release. As such, this is a great way to make gaming history accessible to as many players as possible, giving them the chance to play however they want. Being over 20 years old, Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition doesn't break new ground, but it's a masterful remake with a lot of small improvements and a deep care fort he source material.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I never thought that I could play Age of Empires 2 on console without problems. That Definitive Edition shows me how, and it's really fun. [Recommended]","Overall, Age of Empires II in Deluxe Definitive Edition is a very nice addition to the console that AOE fans can now enjoy on their TV. Via Game Pass streaming, they can also play the game on smartphone.",,,,,,,,,,"After a dozen or so hours in Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, I can safely say that it's the real McCoy. This is not a watered-down port to give Microsoft an easy first-party Xbox Game Pass release. It's the real deal and as feature complete as the PC edition, which is quite an accomplishment. A myriad of quality-of-life improvements makes the original game, while still a classic, very much redundant. The only reason to keep hold of the original is to preserve those big beautiful boxes PC games used to ship in. We're in a new age now, and Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition is the perfect example of taking an ancient game and giving it just enough love to make it feel almost new, something that many other remasters and re-releases so often miss the mark on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Age of Empires 2 hasn't lost any of its fascination, the Definitive Edition brings it in line with modern gameplay sensibilities and, as an upgrade, is as good as it gets.

Kudos!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-forgotten-city,"The Forgotten City may have started out as a simple mod, but the small team at Modern Storyteller has taken the time and effort to craft it into its own memorable experience, one that I’m glad to have had and implore you to as well if any of the above has piqued your interest. Well worth the price of admission, The Forgotten City will leave a lasting impression once final revelations are revealed, just always keep in mind the Golden Rule.","The Forgotten City features a compelling story taking place in a mystifying city. The writing is more than clever and has you experiencing both horror and mirth. The deduction aspect of the game might not be breaking any new ground but the experience is enjoyable and worthwhile as a whole. If you’re unsure of this one then maybe wait to make sure the patch is fully implemented. I would also avoid any playthrough videos as they could easily spoil the story, and that is the most satisfying part of the game.",,"The Forgotten City has surprised us with how engaging it is. The time loop mechanic is used to great effect and works much more than a simple gimmick, and the standout is the writing, which keeps you invested line after line. It's not a home run, with some overall clunkiness to the game and certain segments that could easily have been stripped out, but it's definitely a 10-12 hour adventure worth taking, with many paths and possibilities to uncover.",,,,,,"The Forgotten City is a fantastic entry in the oft-forgotten mystery-adventure genre, but a handful of flaws slightly detract from the experience.",,,"The Forgotten City turned out to be an amazing adventure, with a very well conceived story and an original use of the time loop mechanic.

It’s absurd to think it was mostly developed by a three-person team, and yet the clear, unanimous focus a team this small permits is evident throughout the entire game. It is clever not just in terms of its story or themes, but in how it packages and delivers those themes through one of the most inspired and tight gameplay loops I’ve seen in a long time. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a history buff, story lover, or video game fanatic with a penchant for mystery and immersive design - The Forgotten City is a game that everyone should play because it’s a game that signals to the future of the industry. Bit of a paradox given that it’s set two millennia ago, eh?

tinykin,"Tinykin doesn’t do anything original in the platforming genre, but that doesn’t matter. What it does, it does really well. I played the whole game through is one sitting of about 6 hours and had a silly grin on my face the whole time. While that may seem really short for some players, I appreciated that it didn’t overstay its welcome. It showed up and gave me a solid gaming experience and moved on. I didn’t get bored or find myself just wanting it to be over. While I would have liked a few more mechanics to mix it up in the later levels. I was so enthralled with the environments that it didn’t take away from my overall impression of it. This game was full of clever dialogue, enough puzzles to keep me happy and a narrative twist that kept me on my toes. It’s quirky from start to finish and proof that good things can come in small packages.","Tinykin has utterly caught me off guard in all the best ways. It’s a joy to play from start to finish, with simple yet fun mechanics letting us explore this giant house and find something new and exciting in every nook and cranny. A lack of real challenge lets it down a fraction, but that’s a small gripe in what is otherwise an excellent experience.",,,"Tinykin, although short, deserves a huge amount of attention. A well-loved Disney movie run through Futurama via Pikmin is what you get here and there is no other way to describe it other than being a joy to play",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tinykin brilliantly revisits the ""Pikmin-like"" by successfully adapting it to the platform game with puzzle-game inclinations.

pentiment,"I started playing Pentiment wondering what I had gotten myself into. The first hour was slow, a lot of reading, and a lot of religion. But once I got into it, I couldn’t stop playing. Utterly addictive like a novel I couldn’t put down. Pentiment was a highlight of my year, and one of the best games I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing. Covering an abundance of topics, including losing people before their time, and loss of a child, there are many options to create great discussions if you want to talk about this game with others. I look forward to talking to my friends after they’ve had a chance to experience it. It’s not perfect, I don’t think any game is, but about as perfect as you’ll find. This game will likely divide players, but those who enjoy narrative driven stories, historical settings and perhaps even a murder mystery will surely find something to love. Pentiment is a perfect jaunt through an imperfect part of history.",,"Pentiment is a true achievement of marrying story, style, and theme into a magical and cohesive whole. In lieu of 3D graphics that try too hard and still fail to represent an authentic-feeling world, Obsidian’s artists opted for a more illustrative aesthetic to tell their gripping story of a murder in an abbey, a choice that resonates throughout the entire game. While it might not satisfy every player, especially those expecting a more traditional RPG or adventure experience, those who can immerse themselves in Pentiment’s vision of 16th century Bavaria will find one of the best games of the year.","Pentiment is one of the most unique and clever games we've played in a very long time. It may be the fabulous art style that first draws you to this one, and it really is quite the looker, but it's actually the very obvious care that's been poured into the narrative and the exacting detail in every aspect of the world-building here that ends up selling the whole thing so well. With a story that really goes some places, tons of history to learn about, lots of fantastic characters to meet and plenty of fun and surprises along the way, this is one medieval murder mystery you should absolutely check out as soon as it hits Xbox Game Pass.","Pentiment is a superb game that marks an important step forward for its genre. Quiet, contemplative and intelligent, it is a shining example of what happens when a team is allowed to expand their horizons and take risks.",,"Pentiment is a narrative gem and artistic beauty, but it could be perceived very differently. Give it a try and it will surprise you.",,,"Pentiment's gameplay — or lack thereof — may deter some would-be players, but those who become invested in its lovingly crafted world set in distant past, emotional and human narrative, and gripping murder conspiracy are guaranteed to fall in love.",,"Pentiment is a vibrant adventure that fully embraces its time period, artistic style, and sense of mystery. It’s methodical pacing and focus on dialogue won’t appeal to everyone, but Pentiment knows what it wants to be and does it exceptionally well.","Pentiment is, for better or worse, a sort of big interactive comic book showing a huge love for European medieval history, with an intriguing plot and great artistic design but with a great deal of text to read and interactions limited mainly to map exploration and dialogues. A fascinating title, mainly thanks to its subject matter, but definitely not for everyone.","Pentiment is a complex medieval thriller, where mystery is as important as themes like love, death, passing of time and weight of our choices. Obsidian Entertainment excels in Pentiment, showing us what they can do creating powerful narrative, characters and story. Undoubtedly a GOTY contestant.","Pentiment is an artistic triumph, and a fantastic choice-based adventure game/RPG with a protagonist that you can genuinely mould to your liking to make everyone's experience with the game likely to turn up different versions of events. It's refreshing to play something so laser-focused on a single setting, and captivating to see how the town and its people change both with time and based on the events that play out around (and because of) Andreas.",,"Pentiment is an incredibly enchanting adventure game that really is like no other. It doesn’t quite have the same depth and ingenuity that Disco Elysium has, but what it lacks in depth, it more than makes up for in charm. After a slow start, this murder mystery really becomes the talk of the town.","With its slick aesthetic close to illuminations and its implacable authenticity, Pentiment is a scintillating tribute to the Renaissance era. It is also granted some rather intriguing crime scenes, a handful of funny scenes and above all a successful time structure and choices that really matter. Too bad that his story sometimes so laborious and a last act slightly winded are so many thorny elements.",,,"Pentiment is not going to be popular. I do think however that it will become a cult classic… It’s a unique, dazzling work of art that will stand the test of time for as long as we remember it.","Pentiment is one of those games that seem simple but enclose you more than what they show from the outside. It is a narrative with a strong classic adaptation, which many lovers of the middle ages and the genre will love. It is not the perfect game, but it will give us a very interesting story.","Pentiment is a game that will stick with you for a long time after you play it. Its unique blend of thought-provoking discussion, historical accuracy, and challenging a player’s morals all work to push players to consider everything going on in the game and weigh the pros and cons of heavy decisions that must be made with limited information…It takes a very special work of art to make an observer feel as much as Pentiment does, and the game manages to do so consistently throughout its entire runtime.",,"Pentiment is one of the most interesting games I’ve played in 2022, going far beyond even what most RPGs can manage when it comes to player choice and consequence. Between its setting, its graphical style, and its fantastic story, Pentiment demands your attention.",,"Pentiment plays like a living storybook. You walk, talk and act in a medieval style book that is written as you progress. The game leans heavily on storytelling and its historical background. The game is special in a good way. It's not for everyone, but if you're remotely interested in this turbulent times or a good murder mystery, you should really try this one out.",,"Pentiment is a short but sweet adventure from Obsidian, one that plays to their strengths when it comes to dialogue and gives players enjoyable mysteries to figure out. While there are hiccups at times with the story structure and the climax, it’s still a captivating journey through a rather tense period in history, but one that also seems oddly calming thanks to its likeable characters and visual flairs that bring Tassing to life.",,"We commend the work of Josh Sawyer and his team for this masterful writing and atmosphere. Being one of the very few out of this year's Xbox Game Studios' sweatshop, Pentiment truly is a hit! The adventure is credible, wonderfully blends historical, religious and socio-cultural contexts while proposing an advanced writing and an absolutely sublime and singular graphic layout in the video game industry. According to its creator, Pentiment will clearly not please everyone, but the result here exudes passion, giving life to a niche work of art with an excellent replayability. It is undoubtedly very personal for Josh but this seals the deal for Obsidian: that is what a real gemstone looks like.","At least visually, Pentiment is unlike any game in the marketplace, and its execution is never less than impressive. As a reflection on the role of the artist and the fundamental, unchanging nature of the human experience, it can be thoughtful, amusing and moving. The game’s mechanics, some of the writing and pacing definitely take a back seat to the aesthetics. Taken as a whole, playing Pentiment is another great reminder that not every videogame experience needs to overwhelm the senses, challenge reflexes or be the product of market research. Pentiment might not be for everyone, but that’s ok. Not for everyone is sometimes exactly what we need.",,,,,"Pentiment is about that phenomenon, and also a manifestation of it. It's one of the most engaging and accessible works of living history ever commissioned, and the fact that it exists at all - let alone as a major platform holder's first-party RPG heading into the Christmas season - is a miracle worthy of the saints.",,,,,,"If you enjoy story-driven affairs with choices that impact the world in which you’re playing, Pentiment is worth a playthrough. The historical narrative adventure is perfect if you don’t want to play something that requires a high level of skill, but you still want to enjoy a rich history and impactful choices.",,"We found Pentiment to be utterly addictive and would compare our playthrough to reading a great novel that we could not put down, which feels apt since the game is stylized as a medieval storybook. While the game looks simple, there's an incredible amount of depth and those who like to lose themselves in a good story will enjoy every moment...The game was a little bit too long when compared to other narrative adventure games, and this risks some players not making it to the closing credits, but we're mostly nitpicking. Like their protagonist Andreas, Obsidian has created a masterpiece that not everyone will appreciate, but those who do will remember for years to come.",,,,"A truly innovative murder mystery that really makes you consider the consequences of not only your actions, but the actions of those that came before you. The narrative is at times a little too bogged down in complex lore, but it's a story to be remembered.",Learn to move at Tassing’s sedate pace and patience will be rewarded as a seemingly simple murder mystery makes way for a rich portrait of village life and the difficult choices that come to define it.,"Pentiment is a stunning piece of work, with a rich story, gorgeous artwork, and fleshed out characters that keep you hungry to learn more.",,,"Pentiment is a graphic adventure like no other. We love the medieval setting and writing, but it is slow paced and not every player will enjoy its simple mechanics based on dialogues.",Pentiment is an unconventional masterpiece. Those who embrace the game - despite its slow start - will be presented with a compelling story with absolute world-class writing and a touch of humor. The game grabs you by the throat and won't let go until the credits roll across the screen.,"The game’s name refers to the reappearance of an element in a painting that an artist had painted over. As much as characters in “Pentiment” might fight to maintain the status quo or to turn away from history and heartbreak, they’re no match for the forces that send humanity hurtling forward. While I initially started “Pentiment” hoping for a riveting distraction, what I ended up with was a game about uncovering history and past trauma. In many ways, it is more admirable, brutal and perhaps healing to just face these problems head on.",,,,,"Pentiment is a unique game because of its historical style, which excels. The well-written dialogues manage to continuously captivate, although at times this can make the game very slow. Nevertheless, a title that is absolutely worth playing, as it is a work of art to watch and fun to experience.",,,,"A brilliant take on narrative adventure games by Obsidian. Pentiment is an awesome portrait of XVI century Europe and a compelling game about the sense of history, religion, tradition and personal beliefs. Sometimes the narrative structure is constraining, but overall the writing is amazing, the style is great, and the bibliography become part of the game in a clever way.",,"Even if it's not a particularly ambitious production, Pentiment is a small gem that shows all the love for the late Middle Ages and its art in every single aspect.",,,,,"One of the most well written video game stories ever told. It transports you to a different time and place, and leaves you longing for more.","Unique, exciting and clever, Pentiment is a beautiful yet educational adventure - a quiet but valuable gem in Xbox Game Pass.",,,A Dark Ages mystery whose gameplay and dialogue are as unique as it’s daringly unconventional premise and visuals.,"Obsidian already has its name established in the market, but Pentiment came to present a new talent from the producer. The game explores an impossible-to-ignore narrative and a progression scheme that captures the attention of any player, even those who are not fans of the genre. This is an invitation to Celtic music, rural landscapes, medieval habits and ancient arts such as illuminations and woodcuts. The story of a murder becomes the perfect excuse to explore the disturbing streets of Tassing, a city full of secrets to be revealed.",Pentiment manages to bring a unique experience to a catalog increasingly focused on big blockbusters.,,,,,,,"Pentiment goes all in as a dialogue-heavy historical murder mystery that you won’t want to stop playing. You will question your actions throughout the game because your choices truly matter. No two endings will be the same, which makes you want to replay the game to delve deeper into the mystery. How will your story end?","You won’t play a game like it this year, or even from the past few years lest you dabble in the narrative adventure field, and even then Obsidian’s new opus is pretty distinct. Its writing is among the best I’ve experienced for this style of game, while the cadence of its unfurling mystery is such that the game draws you into its world ever so slightly, you’ll barely realise how deep you are into it before it snags you in its binding. Just go into it with an open mind and the desire to sink yourself into a good book, then let the game do the talking for you and strap yourself in for one of the year’s most unique offerings, and one of its best.",,A pure narrative wonder that will make you want to be discovered and rediscovered over the years.,,,"Pentiment is the kind of masterwork that Andreas chases early in the game, and it's equally as flawed, biased, subjective, and captivating as the pieces he's inspired by. Play it and decide for yourself whether it's worthy of that kind of comparison. That's the point.",,"While Pentiment doesn't make the best first impression, and the lack of music robs it of atmosphere and character, it's well worth digging into if you're a fan of well-written narrative adventures or games that require you to conduct investigations. You'll soon come to love - or loathe - its cast of characters, and with plenty of fun puzzles to solve, minigames to engage in and meaningful choices to make, it's rewarding in ways that other games in the same genre space rarely ever manage.","Pentiment strives to exist somewhere between a history book and historical fiction, not quite committing to a detailed look at history or fulfilling a narrative arc. This is a detriment to the game's conclusion, dampening my memories of the game save for the stories of individual characters. I retain a soft spot for the wise Illuminata and her conversations with Andreas about literature and religion, and I have a parental fondness for a young peasant girl who I watched grow from a gurgling toddler to a young woman. Witnessing their lives play out is a narrative delight, only enhanced by the creative use of Pentiment's different fonts to better convey a person's societal station or education. But limiting how much time the player actually has to engage in the game's best parts hurts the overall experience too much.","Pentiment does what it does with a magnificent blend of dialogue, characters, and narrative. The winding path you’ll take has plenty of off ramps, and while all roads lead to Rome, the journey there feels unique to you. It’s so fascinating getting to your specific ending, you’ll probably even play it again to see what other decisions look like. Pentiment might not be for everyone, but for the genre, it’s a magnificent and compelling work of art.","Pentiment is clearly not a game like the others. An investigation game set in the Middle Ages on the side of Germany, the title developed by Obsidian requires an effort of concentration from players unaccustomed to so many dialogues. Despite this, Pentiment is doing well with a captivating story, pleasant gameplay, despite sometimes readability problems in the story, because of its many dialogues.",,"Pentiment is a remarkable achievement in storytelling. If I were to play again and make different choices I’m sure I would discover new dimensions to these characters I’ve come to know very well. Thanks to the game’s aesthetics, its meticulously researched writing, and the pedigree of its development team, the story of Andreas Maler is well worth experiencing. The game gracefully balances serious themes, soap operatic twists, and some very funny moments, revolving around a large cast of diverse, complex characters. Obsidian may have taken a risk making a game so unlike anything else they’ve made before, but the gamble has well and truly paid off. It’s not just a game for lit nerds.",,"Pentiment's art style is a playful work of art without equal, but it can also inspire with its story.",,,,"Pentiment is mature in a way few games are. It exudes passion for the time period and subject matter, treating every character and issue with respect and reverence. If you want an adventure game that responds to your choices and trusts you to discover its narrative on your own terms, Pentiment is a must play.","Pentiment might just be one of the weirdest AAA-games released this year. By stripping gameplay down to little more than walking and talking, this medieval crime drama feels like a visual novel that took the genre’s title a little too literal. The graphical style is heavily inspired by the illustrations of medieval books, which ties directly back into the main character’s background story as an illustrator. With an excellent story, great dialogue and too many mysteries for just a single playthrough, this odd little gem is one that may take some getting used to, but will reward you for your patience with a story more interactive and deeper than most.",,,"With a deeply interesting plot that rewards diligence, Pentiment is a tale of pure brilliance. Using a depth and intricacy that defies the game’s simple aesthetic, Obsidian’s latest proves incredibly difficult to put down until its drama has played out – and when all’s said and done, you will want to do it all over again.",,,,"Pentiment is not a bad game, it’s just not one that I have no real interest in; It’s more along the lines of an interactive, mystery novel than a video game. While I loved the storybook art style, the overly stylized font was just too much to look at for long play sessions. And Pentiment tends to drag on a bit too long for my taste, but for those that have a love of history, murder, religion, betrayal, secrets, walking from left to right/right to left and reading your video games; then I think you should try Pentiment, especially at the price of $19.99 or included with your Game Pass subscription.",,,,,A brilliant narrative adventure that is filled with intelligence and heart. [Eurogamer Recommended],"If you’re looking for a clever murder mystery with interactive narrative decisions, beautiful 2D art, and a wonderful historical fiction treatment, you owe it to yourself to check out Pentiment. [Review impressions]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pentiment is a slow and deliberate novel of a game. Though quite lively at times, this is still a game that asks players to read long, intricate conversations and remember scores of characters in a historic setting. The mystery is interesting, and the history is fascinating, but if these aren’t enough to pull you through, you might want to look elsewhere. For patient players, Pentiment is a game like no other, teaching lessons on history, community, and the nature of life itself.",,,"A game like Pentiment doesn’t come around often. Top developers like Obsidian Entertainment usually leave smaller productions like this on the editing floor. The vast majority of games with fantastic stories usually ask players to kill something, solve puzzles, or have some other gimmick to it so that they remain engaged. Pentiment dares instead to rely on its craftsmanship, authenticity, and choice-based dialogue, trusting that the murder mystery is enough of a draw to pull players in. And despite some minor quibbles, Pentiment succeeds in its pursuit, creating a fantastic generational period drama with a wonderfully original vision.",,,Pentiment sheds the dice rolls and combat to emphasize the branching conversations and compelling narrative that Obsidian is best at. And the result is an engaging page-turner that can only really work as a video game. [Quick Look],,"A gorgeous, towering watermark for choice-driven narratives, enlivening a heartfelt medieval saga to surpass the greats in prose and play.",,,,"As a mystery to be solved and a mediation on how stories evolve over time, the game's focus wanders and ironically comes to fixate on elements like presentation and background lore that can all too easily overwhelm the basic tenets of telling an engaging story.",,,,"Pentiment shows that even with a small team, Obsidian can create a narrative masterpiece. Its clever systems allow players to craft a unique experience through a gripping story fueled by some of the strongest character writing I have ever seen. Don't let the graphical direction fool you; this is a beautiful game through and through. I can only hope to see more of these types of unique gaming experiences from Xbox Games Studios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recommended to all the lovers of skateboarding and platforming.",,"OlliOlli World takes the tight, rewarding gameplay of its simple predecessors, dresses it up in a beautifully colourful and quirky new art style, and layers on a bunch of new systems that make it even more satisfying to master. It's a masterclass in how to make score attack games that can have players attack the same spot for hours at a time in search of those vital few points that would give them the lead over a rival, with dozens of awesome hand-crafted levels and countless procedural ones on which to chase those big numbers. The manual dexterity required coupled with the breakneck pace of the game can be a little scary at first, but once muscle memory starts to kick in and you find yourself going for timely tweaks and greedy grabs without even knowing you're doing it, you will have finally transcended and achieved Gnarvana. Now, just one more run...",,"A perfect evolution of the previous two OlliOlli games, OlliOlli World goes big with a uniquely appealing art style, fun character customisation, and a slew of options, without compromising what makes the series so addictive and inviting. It's good to be rad.","In short, it's more complete, more pleasant to watch, still as exhilarating and quick to play. A real achievement for the license.","OlliOlli World is a fantastic 2.5D adventure sports title. Do you have what it takes to become the next Skate Wizard? Perform tricks, grind rails, leap chasms, and complete every task across 5 unique districts. It's colourful, loud, fun, and will remind you of the 90s.",,,,"OlliOlli World is a BLAST to play. Roll7 did an excellent job changing up their formula while still making this feel like an OlliOlli game. While it isn’t faultless with its difficulty, OlliOlli World is welcoming for just about anyone with any skill level.",,,,,,"Even if it still doesn’t lead to some sort of resurgence in extreme sports games, OlliOlli World can still stand as one of the most unique and fun skateboarding games of all time, one that’s perfectly suited for both novices and masters alike thanks to its intense and immaculate level design, massive variety of tricks to pull off and tons of challenges to keep players coming back for more. Top it all off with a superbly psychedelic style and setting to make things pop, and what you have is a skateboarding experience that may very well indeed be the closest to Gnarvana that you can get.",,"Olli Olli World consolidates the positive impression felt after its art preview. The developers have succeeded in opening up to a wider audience while keeping the elements that made the licence a success. They’ve managed to get out of their comfort zone and renew themselves. The game is dynamic and addictive. It’s hard not to be struck by the “last one, I promise!” syndrome when you want to take on one final challenge before putting down the controller. Additionally, the substantial content and the upcoming DLC guarantee many hours of gaming to come. A licence to discover or rediscover whether you are a rider at heart or not.","OlliOlli World manages to stay true to its predecessors whilst making verts feel fresh. The multi-faceted levels are an absolute joy, adding experimentation and exploration to the solid foundation. With enough depth to please veterans, yet simple enough to attract newcomers, Roll7 has nailed the mechanics, making the trip to Radlandia essential.",,,,,,,,,,,"OlliOlli World has something for everyone, be it hardcore skaters, platformer enthusiasts or those simply looking for a chilled out time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Courtesy of some really great hand-drawn art, it’s hard not to adopt the game’s most excellent and bodacious attitude through osmosis. But OlliOlli World’s strength, as it has always been, is in its low barrier to entry and the fact it’s just so damn fun to pick up and play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"OlliOlli World is a unique and fun skateboarding game, despite a few flaws here and there, and it holds its own against more “mainstream” skateboarding games like Skate. Even if players have never picked up an OlliOlli title before, OlliOlli World is worth its price tag.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A whole 7 years after the predecessor “OlliOlli2: Welcome to Olliwood” this minimalist skateboard series rises from the grave prettier than ever. With a new comic-style look and a smoother learning curve this sequel aims to conquer the heart of fans and newcomers alike.

The new hand-drawn graphical art style makes it easier to have branching paths and a better sense of depth than ever before, which allows for grander levels and more mechanics to be added. The controls are simple enough, and quick reactions will be needed to fully master all the levels by stringing together one long-combo throughout.

judgment,,,,"If you've never played Judgment before, what are you waiting for? The remaster is one of the best next-gen exclusives to play right now and has never looked better. If you've already played it, it may be hard to justify the price tag at this point, but the substantial upgrades ensure it's the best the game has ever been. There's nothing in the way of new content outside of all previously released DLC, but Yagami's adventure is just as compelling and original as it once was.","Judgment on Xbox Series X|S is an incredible achievement. Whether this is your first foray into the wider Yakuza franchise, or you played it upon its original release, the graphical upgrades are very impressive. It is also helped by being a brilliant game, mixing more traditional Yakuza elements in with a detective film noir thriller.",,"Judgment for Xbox Series is the definitive edition of Judgment, where we will experience the adventures of ex-lawyer Takayuki Yagami in search of a serial killer through the streets of Kamurocho with his trusty sidekick Kito.

The new detective elements are superficially fun, but quickly devolve into tediousness. The true strength lies with its story and characters and the lively world full of side quests and mini games. While Judgment is an impressive game both technically and mechanically, it falls short of really pushing the limits of the established Yakuza formula.",,,,,,,"Judgement is a game that was limited by its one console release. It is great to see the team at Ryu Ga Gotoku bring it to a wider audience. If you have never played a game in the Yakuza franchise this is a great jumping off point. It captures what makes those games so great without requiring a ton of investment in older titles to appreciate the story. There is so much to love about these games and I am constantly impressed at the way the team is able to craft genuinely fantastic characters and still pump out hefty experiences on a regular basis. I hope the Judgement series gets to continue, but as it stands this game is one worth checking out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Judgement is by far one of the better entries in the Yakuza franchise. It is a gritty detective story, with a killer in it that is legitimately scary, thanks to the performances. The Dragon Engine getting a boost from the new generation of consoles shows how Judgement was meant to be played, with extremely short load times and buttery smooth 60 frames per second that is unwavering.

Its speed, races, and varied tracks almost make the base game not nearly as fun to experience.",,,,,,,,"Bigger, better, funnier: Forza Horizon 3’s Hot Wheels expansion was already a success and this one exceeds the expectations. Similarly to Mexico, this new map is beautiful and has some spectacular panoramic views. Unlike what the licence has been adopting for the past few years, this expansion offers a satisfying progression system that gives a real sense of evolution and that is truly a blessing. Cruising around is still pleasing, but the absence of a new type of event truly is a shame. Forza Horizon 5: Hotwheels is a great addition and we are eager to discover what is next.","The Forza Horizon 5 Hot Wheels expansion is really easy to recommend if you enjoy Forza Horizon 5. It adds a brand new, Hot Wheels-themed region and 10 new Hot Wheels cars that you can earn for your collection. You’ll get hours of playtime from Hot Wheels park, from ranking up to Legend status to developing your own tracks in the creator. It’s worth noting that this Hot Wheels expansion is also quite a bit more enjoyable than the recently released Hot Wheels Unleashed game, which makes me wonder… when Playground Games are done exploring the world of Fable, maybe they should be tasked with a full-on Hot Wheels game. At any rate, I would highly recommend the Forza Horizon 5 Hot Wheels expansion.",,,,,,"Forza Horizon is such a strong brand name and has always offered so much quality and innovation in a very limited genre that people just can’t expect anything less, and even though Hot Wheels is a solid DLC that can easily blow many full fledged arcade racing games out of the water, the fact that it’s not “innovative” enough compared to previous entries in the series.",,,,,,Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels is a worthy addendum to one of the best racing games ever made.,,,,"It isn’t as surprising and novel as it was the first time around, but Forza’s high-speed brand of life-sized, toy-themed stunt racing is still a riotous good time.",,,,"Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels made me feel the joy of toys again, and I fully enjoyed the charm of racing culture in the repeated rotation and fall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Through more cars, challenges and a new map, Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels becomes a fun DLC that all lovers of this racing game and toy cars should not miss.",,Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels is what we expected of racing these type of cars: adrenaline given by the mechanics of the game and an exorbitant show. All this makes up a package that can be taken very seriously by scale model fans and enjoyed in the most arcade-like way possible by newcomers of the hobby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels is a delightful DLC pack for the core game. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does provide some extremely fast racing and a fresh enough energy to ensure that racers are happy. Adding something onto a game as impressive as Forza Horizon 5 is always a challenge, but this content pack does the trick.",,"If you enjoy Forza Horizon 5 and want more, this Hot Wheels expansion comes highly recommended. The track-based antics here are more restricted, which may put off players who enjoy the off-roading freedom that the base game provides, but in turn it’s a whole new experience with a completely different feel. As long as you like driving really fast and performing insane stunts, you’ll love Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels. You don’t even need to be a fan of actual Hot Wheels cars to appreciate it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels is a thrilling ride that pushes the boundaries of physics and even allows you to build and share your own tracks. It's a great example of an expansion that mixes up the gameplay of the base game enough to make it worth owning as well.,,,,"Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels expansion offers extreme speeds on dangerous courses with turns and loops that will keep your head spinning. Despite the name, there are very few Hot Wheels cars though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a-plague-tale-requiem,"Over the 15 to 20 hours the campaign will take to complete you get completely entranced into Amicia and Hugo’s struggles, becoming attached to the returning siblings and astonished within the world they explore. The contrast of the dark and deadly world versus the goodness from within the cast is a great juxtaposition that isn’t always easily executed. Asobo Studio has performed magic, crafting a tale worth telling that’s emotionally charged and enthralling to experience from start to finish. Everything from Innocence is improved upon, from its combat, gameplay, visuals, audio and even narrative. A Plague Tale: Innocence was my Game of the Year in 2019 and they’ve taken that title again in 2022 with A Plague Tale: Requiem.","A Plague Tale: Requiem has improved on the already great Innocence in basically every way, giving a game that feels, plays, looks, sounds, and flows absolutely brilliantly. A worthy sequel, and one that is not to be missed.","Siblings Amicia and Hugo went to hell and back in A Plague Tale: Innocence in their quest to survive an inquisition, endless hordes of rats, and the humans that looked to take advantage of the young boy’s curse. And now, in A Plague Tale: Requiem, they must pay the devil his due. This is the tale of the duo wanting to control their own fate as the fragile peace they had found falls apart, and the harsh lesson that their choices have consequences. As a game, Requiem is a bigger, better, and more ambitious adventure over its predecessor, but as a story, and a look into the lives of the characters that inhabit it, it’s so much more.","Neither of these nit-picks detract much at all from what a Plague Tale: Requiem achieves though, and that's providing an incredibly evocative adventure through 14th century Europe during The Black Death. Asobo's sophomore effort is seriously impressive, delivering a balanced adventure that knows exactly when to mix things up, whether that be a introducing new story beat, a fresh location to explore, or a different combat option to make use of. Requiem is exactly the kind of new AAA narrative adventure we've been craving for a while on Xbox Game Pass, and we can't wait to see what this developer does next. Asobo Studio is really hitting its stride.","If you were a fan of Innocence then you are going to adore A Plague Tale: Requiem. It’s a familiar experience but one in which the mechanics, visuals, sound, and story have all been ramped up. Lasting around thirteen hours, A Plague Tale: Requiem manages to eclipse the first game; pretty much every minute is heavenly.",,"A new gem has appeared in the next-gen. Requiem is bigger and better than Innocence, even with a more mature narrative. And probably has the most realistic graphics ever seen on a console. A 2022 essential.",,,"A Plague: Tale Requiem is a positively gorgeous, perfectly expanded sequel to A Plague Tale: Innocence and is a great conclusion to the story of Amicia and Hugo. Despite some minor complaints and a world that sometimes feels too lifeless, A Plague Tale: Requiem is an absolute must-play title in 2022.",,,"A Plague Tale: Requiem develops the strengths of the first chapter to the full, to create a cinematically cut, emotionally charged adventure with satisfying stealth mechanics, action, puzzles, memorable characters, heart-pounding sequences and lots and lots of rats.","A Plague Tale: Requiem is the consecration of Asobo Studio. The game is able to offer us an experience that improves on its predecessor in every way, putting at our disposal a series of gameplay, graphics and design improvements that will keep us hooked for hours. Furthermore, the relationship between Amicia and Hugo perfectly represents the brotherly bond, presenting a story that has a soul of its own.","A Plague Tale: Requiem is a fantastic stealth game with an intriguing story (once it finally gets going) that Xbox Game Pass subscribers and fans of the original really shouldn't miss. Requiem's gorgeous, yet bleak and harrowing world is a joy to explore, and thanks to expanded combat and additional options that allow you to approach stealth sections in whatever way you see fit, the gameplay really is a step up over Innocence. A few performance issues, some slightly underbaked characters, and a constantly whispering Amicia do detract from the experience, but overall, Asobo has created a fantastic sequel here that demands a playthrough.",,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is a mighty fine follow up to Innocence, and will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Sure, there’s the odd interesting design choice littered throughout and the game has the odd technical issue, but other than that, Requiem is a great way to spend a weekend.","A Plague Tale: Requiem is the game of confirmation. That of a sister's faith in her little brother when the world crumbles at the foot of their defeat. Then, that of the great talent of Asobo Studios. Offering richer gameplay without upsetting the formula, this sequel never forgets the essentials in relation to the genre it targets. Amicia's desperate fight is at least as magnificent as the graphics and soundtrack that drive the work. The infiltration mechanics can challenge, and we would have liked a final finishing coat, but none of the defects encountered tarnish our judgment: with Requiem, the Bordeaux studio delivers a great vintage. Dark red as death.","A Plague Tale: Requiem is an incredible action-adventure title. This much-anticipated sequel arrives on Next Gen consoles, PC, and Switch Digital only. However, gamers on these machines will adore the brutal and sombre journey they'll experience. It retains many much-loved mechanics but evolves miles beyond my wildest expectations. Accordingly, this latest instalment blew my mind, and I can't stop raving about it.",,"The game has a lot of good things going for it. The narrative, puzzles, combat and new game mechanics make for an interesting and worthwhile experience but the extended game length is unnecessary and makes it feel like the story is being padded out to breaking point.","A Plague Tale: Requiem is a sure candidate for GOTY because of how great it is. It's hard not to get hooked on its story or fall in love with its artistic direction, it makes us empathize with the characters and their experiences. Every player should give it a chance, even the first game.",,,"No game is perfect, but A Plague Tale: Requiem is everything I could have asked for in a sequel. It refines and improves on all of the issues I had with Innocence, creating a game that doesn’t feel all that different, but simply feels far better. Instead of reinventing the wheel, the team at Asobo Studio evolved it instead, making a far better version of an already good game with a refined version of the same formula. Anyone who remotely enjoyed the original needs to check it out.",,,,,,"Logically enough, A Plague Tale: Requiem is a more beautiful, bigger, and complete continuation of its predecessor. Resuming the story where it left off, this new adventure embarks us in a story as well mastered as ever, filled with some very well-designed characters. The more open confrontations make the whole gameplay more dynamic without changing its essence. All in all, it is a beautiful narrative experience sublimated with some gorgeous sceneries that does not feel very different from the first episode. Players expecting bigger changes will be disappointed, but there is no doubt that single-player fans who liked A Plague Tale: Innocence will once again fall under its spell.",,,"A Plague Tale: Requiem has a strong identity and a good degree of allowance for player creativity and expression. Moving through its stunning world and spending time with its characters is gratifying – even if many of its setpieces are terrifying or grim, even if its inhabitants are a bit too chatty, and even if there are far, far too many rats. The hope you find on the other side is usually worth the struggle.",,,,,,,"A Plague Tale Requiem is one of the must play games of 2022 on the Xbox Series X and if you enjoyed the original or looking for something different yet totally enjoyable, this next-gen experience from Asobo Studio will keep you invested from start to finish. Highly Recommended!",,,,,,,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is an impressive sequel to one of my favorite action-adventure games, upping the ante in almost every way. It doesn’t do a ton to distinguish itself from its predecessor in terms of its actual gameplay mechanics, but with a depressing yet awesome story, fantastic graphics, and rat-filled moments that I’ll never forget, this unique adventure very much deserves your attention. I certainly wish it were more ambitious with its stealth action sandbox and took more risks than it does, but it’s still a worthy follow-up that left me with some great memories and a few recurring nightmares.","A Plague Tale: Requiem expands on every aspect of the original. It is a tight, single player experience the like of which feels rare these days. Full of tension, enjoyable puzzles and violent flurries of combat, it serves as a strong sequel and engaging narrative experience in its own right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is a magnificent, engaging, at times heartbreaking sequel. An experience characterized by an incredible artistic direction, that gives life to sequences with a great visual impact and a sense of discovery typical of the best adventures. The stealth gameplay is once again central but has been improved. What a pity the game only runs at 30 fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X and it's really heavy on PC.",,,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is what we hoped for: a reconfirmation. Asobo has built a sequel in an almost artisanal way that knows perfectly where he has to bet his chips, where he has to stop and where there was no need to put his hand. The end result is once again a surprise, but for different reasons. A Plague Tale: Requiem has what it takes to make it better than its predecessor. It is true, I may have shown a certain mild disappointment on the graphic aspect but, given the starting point, signaling a slight improvement, even though it may be below expectations, still places the game as excellent example. Also because, A Plague Tale (the series) is not that, it never was. It has always been a memory to go through, it has always been the story of Amicia and Hugo. A story that, I bet, will remain in your memory. In the memory of the video game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"A Plague Tale: Requiem has seemed to me an exercise as remarkable visually as irregular mechanically and narratively. A competent videogame that will please those who enjoyed the first one, but that repeats, and I would even say that it intensifies, some of the mistakes that were pointed out to the original.",,,,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is what we all expected from a sequel, besides the lost of surprise in his final version. With his pros and cons, fans of narrative adventures will love this.",,,,"When the game sings in its strongest moments, however, it’s a joy to play. Solving environmental puzzles, discovering workbenches to upgrade your gear, uncovering hidden Codex entries, evading the enemy in rewarding, stealthy ways that empower the player’s sense of agency, and in unfolding the next bit of connective narrative tissue, A Plague Tale: Requiem is great. Excellent even. But it’s fleeting, and Asobo crashes you down to Earth just as quickly as you might have felt on top of it, driven largely by hard-fail scenarios and situations, bolstered still by antiquated or arbitrary gameplay systems.",,A Plague Tale: Requiem is a sequel perfecting all aspects of Asobo Studio's proposal for a spectacular and memorable experience.,,,,,,,,,,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is both a worthy sequel to a sleeper hit, and a brilliant game on its own. Asobo Studio have shown their knack for using believable human relationships as the basis for an unrealistic supernatural horror story. The next chapter in Amicia and Hugo's story deserves to be seen, if anything because the narrative is both unique and powerful. Despite the increasing brutality of this world and minor mechanical issues, you'll be in safe hands with this game, unlike our young heroes.","Even though it's not without some faults, A Plague Tale: Requiem is likely one of the better games I have played this year. In a time where story-driven action games are starting to become more sparse, Asobo continues to prove with Requiem that it's very much capable of assisting with carrying the torch within this genre. I'm not sure if we'll see future Plague Tale titles come about in the future, but given the leap that has been seen with Requiem, I'm definitely hoping that this isn't Asobo's final outing in this space.",,,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is a step forward from its predecessor in every way. The game not only symbolizes the coming of age of heroine Amicia, but also Asobo as a developer. The result is a beautiful and heartbreaking story, tainted only by a contrived ending.",,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is a vastly expanded sequel, for better and for worse. Returning fans might feel that everything here is quite familiar, if only bigger and more beautiful. If the improvements to combat and the uneven story aren't enough to entice you, the relationship playing out between our two central heroes is worth another trek through rat infested France.","As in part one, the core experience of A Plague Tale: Requiem consists of its atmospheric strengths, strongly attached to the game's pleasant heroes. Beside its magnificent presentation, including beautiful graphics and prime voice-over artist, the sequel does overall also a better job concerning gameplay, making Requiem the better game. But the extension of variety and freedom during regular stealth action stages or the clever puzzles can't hide the existence of the (few) lousy and misplaced defensive battle sequences.",,,,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is a fantastic sequel on several counts. It improves on its predecessor in just about every way by finely tuning its stealth and navigation systems, adding more gameplay variety, and delivering a visually stunning world that puts games with much larger budgets to shame. Its weak spot comes down to its messy storytelling, which exposes the thematic limits of a medium that’s over reliant on violence as its primary form of interaction.",,,"Sequels are hard. Team Asobo has managed to make a more compelling world with even more compelling characters and wrapped it in a gorgeous bow. There are issues for sure. The game doesn’t innovate nearly enough and performance on next-gen consoles is disappointing, but this game continues to prove that this team of developers is extremely talented. I hope we continue to see them flourish and create new experiences. A Plague Tale: Requiem is a truly exceptional experience that everyone should check out. It is on Game Pass so the barrier to entry is lighter. Definitely give it a shot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is a brilliant follow-up to 2019’s cult hit, and could be a real contender for a lot of people’s Game of the Year lists.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A Plague Tale: Requiem is definitely a game worth playing for fans of the original despite my criticisms. Overall I enjoyed my time, thanks in no small part to a vastly superior second half. I lament the loss of better directed linear stealth in favor of a messier open environments, but the core of what makes A Plague Tale great - strong characters, bleak horror, and tons of squicky rats - remains firmly in place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
destiny-2-the-witch-queen,,,,,The Witch Queen expansion for Destiny 2 on Xbox Series X is one of the better ones that Bungie has produced.,,"The Witch Queen is, undoubtedly, the best Destiny 2 expansion to date due its story and content.",,,"he Witch Queen offers Destiny 2's best campaign to date, an exciting new weapon archetype in the Glaive, and takes its first steps in revitalizing the Light Subclasses in line with Beyond Light's Stasis Subclass with Void 3.0. It also adds the enticing prospect of weapon crafting, which is unfortunately hampered by extremely grind-y requirements to truly experience the most weapon crafting has to offer as well as a raid that could be the most convoluted yet.",,,,"Destiny 2: The Witch Queen is the best expansion Bungie has ever made, thanks to an interesting story, a great villain and a beautiful new zone to explore. Even with some low points, like the poor number of new activities, it's a must to have for every Destiny fan.",,,,,,Quotation forthcoming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Destiny 2: The Witch Queen is yet another reason Bungie’s epic living world has this type of staying power, and new and existing players alike have every reason to jump in here.",,,,"Bugs and PvP aside, The Witch Queen delivers the best version of Destiny 2 yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Witch Queen is one of the best Destiny 2 expansions and a perfect example of how to evolve an online game. It proves that Bungie has a consistent vision and while the developers are not afraid of changes, they introduce them cautiously and cleverly, letting the game remain what it’s meant to be – a pretty much perfect looter-shooter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ultimately, the new narrative in The Witch Queen is absolutely worth checking out, and the game still features what I think is the best gunplay in any game I’ve played- and now it has glaives!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tunic,,,,"Tunic is a fantastically clever adventure that kicks off in familiar Zelda-esque fashion before branching out to become its own thing entirely. There's an exquisitely designed world to explore here, a great big puzzle-box to probe and prod at as you progress through a story that's got just the right amount of mystery and intrigue about it to keep you hooked in. Combat can be a little clumsy at points early on but it improves as new powers are introduced and the game develops and grows into a surprisingly big, surprisingly challenging experience that's absolutely one of our favourite games of 2022 so far.","We’d use one word to sum up TUNIC: delightful. Few games will make you feel so skillful and clever, and fewer still will have the ability to slap a grin on your face.",,"It is an experience for everyone, even if not everyone has what it takes to finish it, not because of the problem of the game, but because of the limitations that each one wishes to impose on themselves. It is a wonder of the indie industry that will surely surprise more than one with its entertaining mechanics, its careful artistic design, and a general experience that manages to feel unique, even despite the familiar essence that it gives off, from the inside of each one of his dungeons.",,,,,"TUNIC is a genre-bending breath of fresh air that includes elements from other popular games that all grease the wheel for an exceptional gaming experience. A must-play for all gamers, especially due to its inclusion on Game Pass.","Tunic doesn't disappoint. Maybe some combat system choices can be a bit perplexing, but they aren't able to ruin one of the most memorable, deep and mysterious indie experiences of the last years. Behind a cute look is in fact hidden a deep, varied and fascinating game, capable of revealing new aspects even many hours after the ending.",,,,,"More than a very good Zelda-like, Tunic is a great puzzle-adventure game that will delight fans of exploration and secrets. Because the game of Andrew Shouldice and his friends contains a lot. Very much. Starting with those hidden off the beaten path, thanks to beautiful colorful isometric 3D. But especially those hidden in a paper manual directly integrated into the game. A brilliant idea that serves as a map, a history manual as well as a collection of clues, and which is at the heart of the progression. Tunic knows how to regularly surprise the player with things present from the beginning - a passage, a game mechanic - but which are revealed hours later. Without forgetting the demanding and solid action phases, which contain significant moments. Fights that can also be made very simple, thanks to accessibility options. What to focus above all on the secrets of Tunic, which we took a monster foot to solve. Because that's where the real wealth of the game is hidden. A big crush.",,,TUNIC is both an incredible and incredibly frustrating title. The combat lets down what otherwise is a masterpiece.,,,,"While its difficulty spikes could use a bit more balancing, it does nothing to diminish my love for Tunic. This is a masterfully designed game that challenges you to take elements of classics that have become familiar and apply them in all-new ways. Its triumphant in-game manual gave me more moments of stunning realization than every other game I’ve played in 2022. If you’re a fan of any of the titles that stand as major influences to Tunic, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.",,,,,,,"Tunic is a great game for a specific audience. The target gamer is someone who has patience, loves puzzles and isn’t bothered by dead ends and roadblocks. For those folks, Tunic is a delightful Zelda-inspired ARPG that unfolds into something bigger than its style suggests. Knowing the shorthand of Soulslikes mechanics will cut through some of the game’s opacity. For some, though, the game’s obstinate refusal to easily give up its secrets may be a barrier to enjoyment, no matter how lovely and inviting the game seems to be.",,,,,,,,"Tunic demands all of your attention to experience its world and mysteries as intended. Fortunately, with excellent world design, fun and diverse gameplay and extraordinary ways to keep you interested in what to come next, it truly deserves that investment and focus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tunic is an old-fashioned entertaining game and a true modern classic for the enthusiast. The level design has been taken care of down to the last detail and the bosses are fantastic. Tunic packs the essence of gaming into a cute, memorable and spirited adventure, leaving many a major release gathering dust. A few imperfections and the sometimes somewhat mediocre controls are the only blemishes on a great adventure.",,,,,,,,,,,"Thanks to a fantastic world, and a series of magnificent puzzles, Tunic is positioned as one of the best independent games of 2022.",,,,,,"Tunic is a really cozy game that only gets better the longer you play. It captures much of what made games like A Link to the Past so immersive in its time, but merges it with its own design elements (and a bit of Dark Souls).","If you love 2D Zeldas or Death's Door, you have to grab it: Tunic is an imaginative action-adventure with clever ideas, a picturesque game world and really poisonous bosses.",,,,,,,,,"Tunic has more than fulfilled our expectations. We had placed high hopes on Andrew Shouldice's work for its proposal and artistic display; luckily, everything we had seen in the demo and trailers was actually the tip of the iceberg. Finji scores another unique title of the independent scene, an action adventure, puzzles and exploration with its own personality. It never ceases to surprise from start to finish and strings together secrets one after another. A worthy exercise of confidence and perseverance: the wait was worth it.",,Tunic effectively does almost everything you could expect from a game inspired by the pair of green tunic and Master Sword. But don't go in expecting something more than a pale imitation of those things.,,"Tunic is a near-flawless experience that celebrates games and gaming from a bygone era in one of the boldest, most confident displays of game-design and creation I’ve ever experienced. Its nostalgia game is strong and my heart strings have been well and truly tugged, strumming a tune(ic) of thanks and adoration for an adventure truly elevated and engrossing; challenging and full of surprise and wonder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tunic is one of those games that won’t let you go until you see the credits rolling. It’s insane, what Andrew Shouldice and his small team came up with and how much lifeblood was poured into this action adventure. Definitely an indie title you should not miss.",,,,,"Despite its obvious muses, Tunic manages to rise above mere flattery, by paying deeper homage to the medium itself.",,,"I enjoyed Tunic, and I was pleased during most of my time with the game. It’s challenging, but it’s also tranquil. It’s a little slice of puzzle-y goodness in the middle of multiple massive open-world releases, and for that I’m grateful it exists. I just wish sometimes Tunic would meet me halfway and not leave me frustrated either with the controls or with the exploration.",,,,,,,,,,,"A brilliant indie surprise not only for classic fans of Zelda and Souls-like games' lovers, but also an enjoyable action-adventure title for everyone.[Recommended]","Playing Tunic feels like revisiting something old, not like something new and original. It's an engaging indie gem with beautiful graphics and oldschool adventuring, but its lack of narrative can make you feel lost and not interested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
devil-may-cry-5-special-edition,,,,,"If you haven’t had a chance to play the original, this is the perfect time, but if you have previously played and liked it, and can’t see yourself going back, this won’t change your mind. Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition on Xbox is, quite frankly, the best way to play the game - but it won’t convince you to part ways with your funds if you were lukewarm on the original.","By exploiting the power of Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition manages to fulfill the original ideas of its developers and to accomplish what the fans of the series have been craving for so long. Nero, Dante, V and Vergil are ready to clash swords against demons, and even themselves, in a memorable journey that can offer loads to the newcomers, but might not fully satisfy old players, who are asked to pay for the game once more.","This Special Edition completes one of the best hack n' slash in recent years, but its novelties may be insufficient for those who have already played DMC 5.",,"DMC5 Special Edition for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S builds on the excellence of the original release. It's not the most essential purchase, since you will soon be able to buy Vergil as DLC for the original release, but with some new game modes like Legendary Dark Knight difficulty and the new graphical options making the game smoother/prettier than ever before, it's sure to be tempting for fans of the series. Our original review score follows.",,,"Clearly, the players who stand to gain the most value from purchasing this re-release are those who have bought or plan to buy a next-generation console and for one reason or another haven’t played or finished the original DMC5 campaign yet, as it is for them that the game will yield the most surprises and offer the most longevity. That said, if I were to draw a Venn Diagram titled “gamer groups interested in buying DMC5:SE” that encompassed the DMC-curious, franchise die-hards looking for new challenges, and brand new 4K60/120 HDTV owners, I’d be willing to bet that there would be a sizeable amount of overlap. Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition is still one of the best looking games of last generation, and if you’re looking for something dazzling to flex the muscle of your next gen console and give your thumbs a serious workout at the same time, you could easily do far worse, especially on Xbox Series X/S where there are fewer standout next-generation games to play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition brings Vergil to the party. The new character gets his own share in the game and you get to complete the whole story as the katana wielding demonslayer. It brings a whole new dimension to this already cool game. Next to that the game has various next-gen upgrades like ray tracing and a higher framerate. You'll have to choose which one you want to activate, so a full nxt-gen experience is out of the question. Still, a worthy upgrade to a brutal game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The definitive edition to enjoy in all the its splendor and without any kind of compromise of one of the most sensational and adrenaline-pumping hack 'n' slash of recent years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Stylish with (now) four playable characters, gorgeously rich move-sets and (still) unfortunately micro-transactions. Also it is a little but prettier, a little bit faster and a little bit more difficult.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While these upgrades are certainly worth picking up the game for those that never played it, some players won’t find enough here to justify another full purchase. Still, even with those caveats Devil May Cry V Special Edition is a rocking pack that really showcases the new hardware, while still remaining one of the best action games ever created.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition is the definitive next-gen Devil May Cry experience. This iteration took what was already one of the best action games of the last console generation and refined everything from the performance to the visuals. Even if you’ve experienced this game before, it’s worth a second look for all of the added enhancements. And if you missed it the first time around, this is the version to play. Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition really is the whole package and a must-play for action fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition has a healthy balance of updated systems and features that make it a great introduction to what we can expect from action games in this new generation. Those who haven’t played will get to experience the best this title has to offer while returning fans can push their skills with the Legendary Dark Knight Mode and being able to play as Vergil. While I would have preferred a totally separate new campaign for Vergil, everything here shows how an amazing game can be better. Now, when is that Lady and Trish DLC coming?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
planet-coaster-console-edition,,,,,"Planet Coaster: Console Edition is quietly one of the best launch titles for the Xbox Series X|S, and made all the better by being available through Game Pass. For a park sim, it is incredibly easy to pick up and play as everything is explained and designed as this version was built up for consoles, as opposed to a simple port. The effort gone into that is noticeable in every single menu and button press; nothing is restricted by the controller.",,,,,,,,"Planet Coaster: Console Edition is definitely the best theme park management game around, with a great porting from the PC version and a very solid gameplay. We would have liked a meatier Career mode, but its Sandbox mode can be very satisfying and it'll be able to entertain even newcomers to the genre.",,,,,The console version of Planet Coaster contains all the charm of the PC version.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’re a roller coaster aficionado, theme park sims don’t come much better than this. An incredible amount of work has gone into making Planet Coaster feel at home on console, and Frontier has done a commendable job of doing so without making sacrifices. It looks fantastic, performs admirably, and designing the park of your dreams has never been more enjoyable.",,"With a practiced expertise, Frontier has translated their fantastic coaster creator to the next-gen consoles without compromising the core qualities of what makes this game great. The radial menu and optional keyboard/mouse controls delivers theme park magic unlike any other, and once again claims its crown -- the king of coasters among mere tycoons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, a ticket to Plant Coaster: Console Edition is a great buy if you’re at all into theme park management. Frontier did a superb job bringing their excellent 2016 PC game to next-gen with console-friendly UI, controls, and everything you could need to get a big jump on your theme park building and management gameplay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While it’s a pleasure to sit on the sofa and meander through one’s epic theme park creation on the big screen, enjoying the sights and sounds of the rides, the crowds, the vendors and the scenery, actually building that park is still easier and vastly more efficient up close and personal on the PC with a mouse and keyboard. Frontier did a great job of bringing Planet Coaster to consoles and is easy to recommend. Just be prepared for a learning curve and a bit of frustration as you get the hang of building your dream park with the controller.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
assassins-creed-valhalla,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla is well executed on several levels, sans the bugs that I ran into. It is a true AAA title that is a worthy playthrough for fans of the game old and new. It is a tale of fate, loyalty, glory and morality. Eivor must make tough decisions as to how to grow their settlement and how they navigate relationships in the world. The decisions you make will change components of the story, so you are in charge of your own destiny.","There’s hours upon hours of entertainment here bolstered by satisfying combat and a story that will engage throughout, although the addictive nature of playing Valhalla often overwhelms the enjoyability – there are so many distractions and enhancements that make it a fully bolstered adventure that you’ll find yourself lost and entrenched in time and again. Valhalla swings for the fences and lands a satisfying and devastating blow that will certainly be felt by most players who experience it, just don’t go looking for a game-changer.",,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla sees the long-running franchise at an absolute high point. A much tighter, more refined and narrative-focused experience, it learns lessons from other recent open world efforts, removing much of the series' tedious open-world busywork and channelling its players through a genuinely excellent and intriguing adventure. There's still plenty of exploring, looting and collecting to be done here but it's so much more engaging, full of fun puzzles and atmospheric treasure hunts that make the downtime between story arcs all the more rewarding. This is Assassin's Creed looking and feeling better than ever.","Assassin’s Creed Valhalla on Xbox is possibly my favourite entry in the series - stunningly glorious, fluid as you like, and full of mammoth amounts of content. If I had to be negative, then at times it can feel a little bit buggy, but I don't think I've played an open-world game that hasn't had this problem and at no point has it affected my enjoyment of the game.","AC Valhalla is a garrulous ode to mediocrity, a cacophonous elegy to boredom that embodies previously successful or unsuccessful mechanisms and a new catastrophic idea about in-game combat. The A.I. is horrendous and the fact that the previously honorable Assassins of the Creed turned out to be blood thirsty savages that are only pleasing their urge for conquest and blood, is repugnant.","Assassin's Creed: Valhalla continues along the path started with Origins and gives us one of the best RPGs of the last several years. A world full of life, a system that fights brutally and hundreds of things to do make it a serious candidate for GOTY 2020.","If you like what Assassin’s Creed has become, then you’ll enjoy Valhalla. It’s fun, big and beautiful, but it’s also repetitive and predictable.",,,,,,Assassin's Creed Valhalla is the best installment of the saga since its early days. After two years of hiatus the saga is back with a solid RPG that takes advantage of the Xbox Series X|S hardware enhancements.,,,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla is yet another impressive entry in Ubi's unstoppable franchise. The hidden blade is back and as lethal as it should be, combat remains a joy, and Eivor proves an immensely likeable lead in a glorious world of dizzying scope.","Assassin's Creed Valhalla offers an astonishing mix of all the formulas of the saga, managing to juggle phases of savage raids on one side and infiltration into the heart of the crowd on the other, without one of its sub-systems do not seem to really suffer from this multifaceted approach.",,"Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is far from being a perfect game, still it’s one of the most evolved and complete chapters of the series, and one of the most interesting titles to play this month.",,,,,,,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla brings the third party to next-gen and a party it is. Take on the story of Eivor and travel to Brittania to conquer the land piece by piece. The game looks amazing and contains new RPG-elements like building your settlement, pillaging, and a huge new skill tree to strengthen yourself. The story is compelling at that, but the action pushes the assassination to the background. The game suffers from a few minor bugs, but nothing too serious. This is simply a must-play from day one.","Assassin's Creed Valhalla is a very good game even though it is far from perfect. It is possible that a little more development time would have favored it. It has its defects, especially technical issues, but, as if it were a Hollywood blockbuster, the whole is fun, and it is what really matters.","The Xbox Series X version of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla takes advantage of the extra horsepower, showcasing a native 4K resolution while running at a targeted 60fps. It will sometimes dip below that, and there aren’t too many other next generation features present, like Raytracing, but otherwise it’s the best way to play the open-world title. Taken on its own and judged on its own merits, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is an enjoyable opportunity to vicariously raid and pillage the English countryside.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Building on the strong foundations of Origins and Odyssey, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is in many ways a minor iteration of the proven formula. Yet, it’s also one of the biggest departures in the franchise’s 13-year history.",,,,"With a sprawling world to conquer and gory combat but also the chance to use that iconic hidden blade, Assassin's Creed Valhalla brings a triumphant balance to the series.","Assassin's Creed Valhalla is a massive, beautiful open-world fueled by brutal living and the dirty work of conquerors. It's a lot buggier than it should be but also impressive on multiple levels.","A hearty slice of Viking pie, goes great with a new console and a flagon of mead. Ubisoft have taken the Creed to a new level with their trip to the Nordic settlement of merry old England.",,,,,"If you weren't a fan of the franchise, this game won't change your mind, but if you are a believer of the Creed, you'll find a gigantic, really engaging experience here. The vikings context fits like a glove.",,,,,,"With an engaging combination of combat, exploration, and crafted story content, this Viking legend is an epic with a little something for everyone.",,,,"Assassins creed Valhalla is a great game to start the new generation with. The world is impressive, loading times are fast and gameplay experience is great and smooth with 60 frames per second.",,Assassin's Creed: Valhalla is one of the best games in the series and a perfect choice to launch the new generation.,,,"What could have been an elephants' graveyard of forgotten ideas instead feels like a series-wide victory lap. [Issue#353, p.96]","Assassin’s Creed Valhalla further refines the RPG style of Origins and Odyssey and their enormous worlds. Addictive progression and an engaging story tie everything together in meaningful ways, but the bloated length almost ruins the impact of the story, while lackluster AI causes combat to wear thin. Still, England and Norway are breathtakingly beautiful with an outrageous amount of things to discover and unique tales to tell.",,,"A strong Assassin’s Creed episode, a motivating open-world-game.: Eivors adventure is not faultless, but delivers an always entertaining mixture of exploration, story, battles and estate development – while looking gorgeous throughout.","The franchise’s famous environment traversal mechanics — essentially parkour — are similarly streamlined yet no less satisfying, thanks largely to the undeniable compulsion the game instills in players to keep moving to see what lies beyond the next ridge or river. Exploration is a driving force.And, of course, it looks phenomenal and runs smooth as an oil slick on next-generation hardware. Players looking for a substantial game that shows off the graphical capabilities of their new systems that will keep them busy well into next year won’t be disappointed in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.",,,,Assassin's Creed Valhalla is the culmination of the new model for the saga that Origins established and Odyssey perfected.,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla succeeds in improving the light-RPG formula initiated by Origins, by correcting some of the excesses spotted on Odyssey: with an upgraded exploration, a less generous loot and fights that go more to the essentials, Ubisoft Montreal is clearly on the right track. However, despite all their efforts to make the progression more digestible and enjoyable, many bugs have ruined the experience. Too bad, especially since in this Xbox Series X version, the game is absolutely magnificent and manages to hold its 60 frames per second in (almost) all circumstances.",,,,,,,"For a game that centres itself around the idea of settlements, negotiation, alignment and choice, Valhalla does an amazing job of making you feel like the spotlight is always on you. It redirects misconception around viking culture and remains an Assassin’s Creed game, though perhaps the lesser of all before it, for the betterment of the franchise. Game of Thrones’ Magnus Bruun is a shoe-in for best voice actor in a videogame this year but, more importantly, Valhalla is a game that will drag you along the Bifröst bridge and into the vision of Fenrir. How you handle all of this is up to you, but to boldly state in the positive, this is as anti Assassin’s Creed as we’ve yet played, and we love it all the more for it.",,,"With Assasin's Creed Valhalla, Ubisoft tries to synthesize a decade-long series, thanks to clever adjustments on its RPG rhythm. With a brilliant lightning, the game visually stands out on Xbox Series X, and offers a more flexible adventure as well as a real stable narrative. Rich, dense, but also time-consuming, Assassin's Creed Valhalla still is a good run, thanks to its historical setting and beautiful landscapes.",,,,"Cut from the very best cloth of open world games, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is a pleasure from start to finish. Though overwhelming in its early hours, once you settle into Eivor’s shoes, exploring England is an exhilarating journey like no other. Try as you might to focus on the main missions, the lure of exploration is too strong, and you’ll find pleasure in every tiny discovery. Is this the best Assassin’s Creed game yet? That’s difficult to say – but it might just be. Especially if you enjoy the beauty of British countryside and the contrasting brutality of viking combat.","Despite its strong connection to past games, Assassin's Creed Valhalla is more than capable of standing on its own. It takes a little while to build momentum, but when it hits its stride, Valhalla is a confident Assassin's Creed title that takes a few narrative risks which, as a whole, pay off. Eivor is a good hero with an identity that drives the mystery behind the main narrative, and she shines in the self-contained arc structure of Valhalla's story. The supporting cast may not shine as brightly, but it's easy to forgive that when exploring England and discovering new nuggets of worldbuilding is so rewarding.",,"Even if Assassin's Creed : Valhalla isn't as groundbreaking as Origins, we welcome some new content, and the comeback of the secret blade for instant kills. The historical aspect is also a nice aspect of the game, which separates it even more from purely fictional titles like God Of War. Overall a great experience.","Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is a good game and remains in line with the previous ones with the addition of only a few new features in the combat system besides the colony that brings a very nice RPG touch. Moreover, the return of the secret blade and infiltration possibilities add to the interest of the gameplay. However, despite a neat atmosphere and a story that holds in breath, the game remains quite classic in its mechanics. In addition, some visual details are a bit old: the faces in particular are still sorely lacking in life even if an effort has been made on this side, not to mention perfectible AI… A good Assassin’s Creed but one which would have benefited by more risk-taking.",,,"Valhalla is a giant step backwards for Assassin's Creed, which is pretty to look at, but feels soulless and fun-free.",,,,"Rather than continuing to build on its predecessors, Assassin's Creed Valhalla takes a more streamlined approach to the open world RPG design, for better or worse. It encourages exploration more than ever, and the new setting is initially exciting, but bland characters and underwhelming presentation don't exactly make it a must-have game for your new next-gen console.",,,"Playing Viking detective was not something I expected to do during Valhalla, but it is a game that --while following much of its traditional template-- is capable of surprise.",,"Assassin’s Creed Valhalla promised to return to the series’ roots after two big steps away from them in Origins and Odyssey, but what it attempts to rekindle ends up holding it back, and what it does best is what makes it decidedly very un-Assassin’s Creed. Those willing to embrace Valhalla for what it is will find a compelling and satisfying action RPG.",,,Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is yet another great entry in the series marred by some side steps and technical issues. I am sure the latter will be ironed out with time. I really have enjoyed all three of the latest games in the series with Odyssey continuing to be my top pick. Valhalla has a truly fantastic story mixed with visceral combat and base management. I hope they iron out the technical issues as 60fps is truly a game-changer for the franchise.,,,,,"It is a Viking saga which does at times struggle a little in reaching its destiny, and in its efforts to evolve the series has made some sacrifices to tell a stronger overall story. But it wins through, in the end quite easily, as it continues the Assassin's Creed saga for a new generation. [Eurogamer Recommended]",,,,,,"In many aspects Valhalla resembles most of Ubisoft’s games, but fortunately progression feels a lot more natural this time around. The game’s not perfect but I had lots of fun conquering new territories, plundering churches, and pillaging coastal villages while following a mature story and enjoying gorgeous, believable medieval Britain. [13/2020, p.26]",,,,,"It is highly satisfying completing a story arc or traversing the world and finding things that you felt that other players might not have stumbled across due to the nature of the open world and its use of way finders. The lack of load times on Xbox Series S is truly impressive given the nature of environments, landscape, and elements that are present on screen. There were a few issues from characters floating in mid-air, bizarre enemy AI, and straight up freezes, although these were far and few between given the scope of it all. Intuitive and varied combat help keep things fresh, even if it does take a fair few hours of gameplay to really get going. Assassin's Creed Valhalla is a thoroughly enjoyable, open-world RPG that is an absolute must for Xbox owners.",,,,"Momentum might not be important to the AC series anymore thanks to its shift towards RPG-lite but its other original key pillar, history, is utilised better than ever here. Not the specifics of what once happened, but the depiction of life elsewhere, elsewhen, and how well that is incorporated into core gameplay loops. With a clearer, more deliberate focus on the past in Valhalla, the series' future is bright.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Since nearly all the various trinkets and relics and map markers have meaningful purpose, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is a rare open-world game where virtually every activity feels worth doing. Like Eivor scaling the snow-covered mountains of Norway, Valhalla achieves new heights for the RPG era of Assassin’s Creed, and I’ve never been more excited to see where the series goes next.",,,,"A saga for the ages, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is a breathtaking journey of discovery that has a cold charm to it. It is both serious and ludicrous in equal measure, an RPG that has added more than it has removed from its core experience while delivering a game that feels familiar and completely new at the same time. Skal!",The game is fairly dedicated to correcting many of the worst creative decisions made across the lifespan of the Assassin’s Creed series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla's vision of ninth-century England is a beautiful place to explore, populated with a great cast of characters who make up for the bland new protagonist, Eivor. Nevertheless, the tired overarching story of Templars and Assassins, and a design ethos that overstuffs the setting with side activities, add unnecessary bloat and distractions to the experience. Valhalla's a solid action-adventure game that does well to capture the turmoil of its historical era, but it's weighed down by the increasingly ponderous legacy of the series it represents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
two-point-campus,,,,"If you enjoyed Two Point Hospital on Xbox Game Pass, you're going to love Two Point Campus as well. It's a great sequel in a superb simulation series, and the college/university setting feels like the perfect next step for Two Point Studios' brand of silly, strategic fun. It's also one of the most enjoyable Xbox simulation games out there thanks to its well-designed control scheme, complete with a single-player campaign you'll almost certainly get invested in.","Despite seeming similar to Two Point Hospital on the surface, Two Point Campus is stuffed with enough new ideas and irresistible charm to ensure it is a sequel well worth playing.",,Two Point Campus is an excellent management game that knows how to adapt its successful formula to the academic field.,,,Two Point Studios has managed to take a management scenario that would otherwise seem incredibly boring and turn it into a simulator that is both fun and funny to play.,,Two Point Campus brings laughs to the simulation genre while allowing adaptive playstyles without ruining the player’s chance at success.,,,,,,"Two Point Campus makes an almost perfect copy by renewing the management game genre. Its amazing two-phase game system allows you to combine the best of both worlds: a game where you can build without stress and with ease, and a game where you can observe with pleasure the result of your work. If the phase of the school year turns out to be more idle than the summer holidays, it allows you to appreciate the excellent work on the atmosphere, the animations and the personalization of your campus. The game is funny and does not fall into the classic repetitiveness of the genre, thanks to its powerful construction tools and its scenarios that know how to renew themselves in terms of decor and gameplay. An example to follow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Two Point Hospital had charmed us, and we were looking forward to Two Point Campus. Ultimately, even if it does not meet all our expectations, we were not disappointed. Because of its solid foundation, we understand that the British studio did not want to alter its recipe. At first glance, one can easily recognise the graphic style and the ever so enticing animation of the franchise’s characters. After a few minutes, we were delighted to find its wacky humour and gameplay mechanics. After a few hours, we were pleasantly surprised by the game’s change of pace with the school years passing by and the building feature in the great outdoors: but that was not enough to satisfy our needs. One will experience a certain redundancy when facing the basic arrangements of the student life and the management of the planning of cultural events. Nevertheless, getting the three stars per scenario in a reasonable amount of time and the excitement of discovering new campuses and wild courses consistently pushed us in indulging some more with the adventure. Final result of the Jury: Graduation with Honours. Congratulations!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Two Point Campus is just as funny, funny and relaxing management sim as its predecessor. It's a virtually stress-free experience with tons of customization options, unlockable objects, perfectly snapping game systems and wonderfully bland humor. However, the mediocre frame rate, a scant number of game modes and the fact that this game is less suitable for simmers who do want to feel a bit of management stress, does not make it the best sequel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s cartoon design is full of character and deep down it’s a really involved city builder of a game offering a strong challenge of your creative mind. Well worth giving a go if you’re subscribed to Xbox Game Pass, as it is included in that package and can even be streamed over the cloud, but for £35 on other systems, it is still a great summer title to get your creative juices flowing.",,,,,,,,,,,,"But beyond its off-kilter humour and (admittedly understandable) fixation on cheese-based snacks, Two Point Games’s latest title is another successful case study in the exploration of classic simulators. It encapsulates everything that made Bullfrog Productions’ Theme series of the late nineties essential gaming, and continues to deliver that experience as a spiritual successor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy,,,,,"Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy could’ve easily ended up being a lacklustre attempt at recreating what makes this group of oddballs so endearing to the Marvel community, but that’s not the case. The acting is top drawer, with a script in place that can make you laugh one minute and bring a tear to your eye the next.","Eidos Montreal has set new standards for the gaming industry when it comes to the design and script of companions in video games. While the gameplay is “simply ok”, the love and care that was given in the creation of this world, its wonderful soundtrack, its intricate accessibility settings, its lovely storyline and its simply amazing companions and their constant banter, make Guardians of the Galaxy an absolute must play for any gamer.",Marvel's Guardians of The Galaxy is a story driven title that feels great to play with and boasts awesome visuals.,"Even with its flaws, Guardians of the Galaxy is a great adventure we’ve had a lot of fun with, thanks to its impressive art design, its great narrative and chemistry between the clumsiest heroes in the galaxy.",,"Guardians of the Galaxy looks good, sounds great, plays well, and above all else, is an authentic experience based on Marvel's misfits.",,"Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy was a surprising experience. Though the game still has some bugs, and a few undesirable features, it comes packed with in-depth characters and an extensive storyline. If you have time to go for a very long virtual walk, this might be the game for you.","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy proved to be a pleasant surprise and one of the best superhero titles around, with a compelling story and excellent characterization. There are still areas for improvement, especially in the gameplay that feels too familiar, but the Marvel license is definitely in good hands.","Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy offers an excellent linear single player experience. With a great artistic design, a fun combat system and an outstanding script, this new title by Eidos Montreal will greatly satisfy any fan of narrative-focused games. Yes, some aspects like its animations are not up to par, but it doesn't impact its final result. We had a huge smile all the way through this fun game, enjoying its dialogues, its combat and sinking in its marvelous setting. And that's the most important thing to us.",,"Even with a couple of technical shortcomings and the fact that the game needs a few patches to correct them, Eidos Montreal made a masterpiece with a lot of love and attention that will be remembered for all time. Marvel fans can finally breathe a sigh of relief and indulge in the new space adventures of Peter Quill’s gang.","While it has one or two irksome flaws, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is, nonetheless, a fine solo experience, with characters that you'll enjoy spending time with, fast-paced combat, and an engaging original story.","With its endearing characters and effective humor, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the pleasant surprises of the end of the year, which is obviously aimed at a very large audience. Behind this careful writing, we feel a deep love on the part of the developers of Eidos Montreal for its marginalized space. And if the adventure is not as epic as we hoped, the journey is nonetheless pleasant with its moments of complicity and the many choices offered which reinforce the player's involvement. A truly attractive journey, in particular thanks to an efficient and fluid combat system which nevertheless shows its limits at the end of the game and against the bosses. Finally, it is more on its visual part that the title can divide. If we find on the one hand original environments and neat character models, we also note the presence of less convincing facial animations in places and sometimes less fine landscapes. It is nonetheless a gripping adventure alongside the galaxy's greatest magnificent losers that has plenty to please MCU fans.",,,,,"Even with its faults that can easily be patched up, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is an absolute love letter to the property and one that any fan should be excited to play. Yes, the gameplay is excellent, but for this game, it's all about the characters. It's about small moments, big moments, and everything in between.",,"Despite some issues with bugs and shooting that could use a little more weight behind it, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy tells a fantastic story that kept me glued to my seat until the very end. An excellent voice cast, killer 80s soundtrack, and strategic combat sweetened the deal. Anyone looking for a fun action game should consider checking it out, and for fans of the Guardians, this is an absolute must-play.",,,,,,"After the commercial failure of Marvel’s Avengers in 2020, Square Enix’s mission was to patch things up with Marvel fans. According to us, the mission is a success – Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy offers here what Marvel’s Avengers should have been when it was released. The script written especially for the title is good and the rhythm between the fight and exploration phases is well devised. The Guardians of the Galaxy universe and the merry crew’s essence remain faithfully respected. The many fan-service elements present in the game should also please the fans. The fights that seemed a bit slow in the gameplay sequences shown at the game’s announcement are fortunately only so at the beginning of the adventure as they will become much more exhilarating later on. Finally, despite a few technical issues that we hope will be fixed in the future, the title offers us a much appreciated artistic direction and above all, a soundtrack that will make many people shuffle their feet.",,,,,"I initially booted up Guardians of the Galaxy with tempered expectations but was surprised with how much fun I ended up having. Despite having a few setbacks, Guardians of the Galaxy is easily one of the best games of the year thanks to its fantastic story.","By dodging the eager game-as-service guff, Guardians of the Galaxy can focus on being something more compelling - even if you won’t play it for as long. For its ten-plus hour runtime, you’ll enjoy a thrilling, gripping, funny, and surprisingly heartfelt adventure. The game built around that narrative framework isn’t earth shattering - but it is enough scaffolding to allow the story to shine.

At first or into games that heavily emphasize the emotional journey of their main characters, you'll come to love this startling adventure through a unique Marvel universe. It helps enormously if you are a somewhat nostalgic thirty-something and of course have eagerly devoured a Marvel film or comic.",,,,"Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy gets back to the classic single-player formula, steering away from the hybrid attempt of Marvel’s Avengers and piecing together gameplay elements from Tomb Raider, Mass Effect and even Knights of the Old Republic to make a quite unique choral adventure. The player is asked to act like the team leader, taking decision and managing the resulting contrasts between the other members. The strength of differences is the big theme of the game, and Guardians of the galaxy is great in telling it both through narration and gameplay.","As a fan of the Guardians’ comic books and movies, I thoroughly enjoyed Eidos-Montreal’s unique take on this supergroup. The nonstop character banter and nicely designed choices make this a journey worth taking, even if the gameplay takes a little too long to highlight the team’s true potential.",,,,,,,"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is like a tie-in of 15 year ago with corridors, forced paths to follow and little arenas in which you must fight enemies in the same way. Marvel's fan will adore references, easter eggs and cameos, but it's not enough to make this project shine like a new star in the galaxy.",,,,,,,,"Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy perfectly balances having a brand new narrative surrounding the misfit team of heroes whilst maintaining their classic characteristics from the Marvel universe. However, I was left wanting more in terms of combat and I still want to play as Groot. Overall, it’s a great game for new and old Marvel fans alike that breathes new life into the now-recognisable characters. Hopefully, Edios-Montréal and Square Enix will consider doing a second game, as there’s so much more of the Galaxy to explore.",,,,,,,,"And that can be said of Guardians of the Galaxy in a multitude of ways. As chaotic as it gets and despite any faults players may have with it, it’s hard not to feel like Star-Lord himself at the end of the game. For a game with such a heavy focus on narrative and choices, player investment is crucial, and Guardians of the Galaxy delivers tenfold.",,,"There’s no cash-in on the overall success of the MCU here, or on the Guardians of the Galaxy movies in a standalone sense. This is a pure videogame born from the paper and ink flesh of the comics before it, imagined as an interactive slice of the IP’s universe. And it absolutely works. The action-RPG lite approach was conclusively the right decision to make, which allows the game’s absolute strength: its story and characterisation, to truly stand out. This is a surprise hit for me, and one of the most enjoyable games from a written and performed perspective you’ll play this year.","While the mechanics at times can be frustrating, Guardians of the Galaxy is a really enjoyable experience that I would recommend to a wide audience: for fans of all things Marvel, action games, and stories that dare to go that step further in relating a compelling fantasy to hugely relevant real-world matters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With its exciting story and characters, the next-gen worthy visuals and especially the great sense of humor we can warmly recommend Eidos Montreal's Guardians of the Galaxy not just for fans of the franchise.

Once I got into gear though I could not stop playing this one and I loved every minute of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Guardians Of The Galaxy is just like the ragtag space heroes it revolves around. It has a lot of messy bits that overcomplicate things, it lets interpersonal conflicts get in the way of its action and its story, and you may get a good laugh from its characters one second and then wish they would leave you alone the next. But, again, like the Guardians, it works because of those messy bits, not despite them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tails-of-iron,"While it may not be as tough as others in the genre, I did enjoy most of my time with Tails of Iron. The constant backtracking along with forced “side” quests really felt like padded hours onto Redgi’s adventure, and this is where it started to tire. When I was progressing my main adventure I was wanting to continually play, but having to go back and forth through the same areas a half dozen times became tiresome. Even so, Tails of Iron will last you roughly 10 hours and you can tell it was designed and created with heart and has a lot of charm to it.","Overall Tails of Iron is an enjoyable experience. Action-RPG fans will find a lot to like here. I know some people don’t like 2D games, but everything here works well, especially the beautiful art and the combat. Some of the side quests can feel like a drag, but the main questline will draw you in and keep you hooked.",,,"It has a fun, finely-crafted story told through splendid animation and outstanding narration, a gorgeous, adventure-filled world with plenty to explore, and one of the greatest 2D combat systems I’ve ever experienced. Tails of Iron is not only one of the best things I’ve played all year, but it’s a sign of great things to come from an incredibly talented studio.",,"The indie developer Odd Bug Studio brings us Tails of Iron, a perfect combination of an RPG and souls like adventure that is a true gem not to be missed in 2021.",,,,,,,,"Overall, Tails of Iron ties together a beautiful medieval world with RPG mechanics and a brutal combat system for a challenging adventure RPG you’ll be thinking about long after you put the controller down. Combat is brutally difficult, but although you’ll often be left howling at a defeat, Tails of Iron’s charming world and in-depth combat customisation will have you back before long, ready to try again. Oh, and just one more time for good measure: Damn you, Clubba!",,,"Even if Tails of Iron has some flaws, starting with its back and forth and its combat system that lacks evolution, the title is simply charming. Helped by its panoply of charismatic characters, its sumptuous visuals and its successful fights requiring precision and coordination, the creation of Odd Bug Studio offers a magnificent journey that we can only recommend ... at least, if the difficulty does not suit you. Don't be afraid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed my time with Tails of Iron, it had a very mature story to tell wrapped up in a charming yet dark world. The clever use of communication between the creatures while using ‘Geralt’ for narration duties is definitely one of my highlights from this game. While I am not a fan of the ridiculously named ‘Souls-Borne’ genre, there was so much to love about Tails of Iron that it was easy to overlook. Sure, the combat was very difficult but who doesn’t like a challenge; I just hope we get to see more from Redgi and his brothers in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An exhilarating 2D soulslike set in a remarkably charming world, Tails of Iron is a surprise GOTY candidate.

It' s not a masterpiece and it doesn't reach the standards of the first LiS, but it's still a great title for those who love the series and who appreciate narrative adventures.","Life is Strange: True Colors isn't perfect, but it's exactly what fans of the franchise needed. Deck Nine has hit the mark and has taken command of the saga with a powerful story and a protagonist to remember.","With its emotional gut-punching story, memorable and wonderfully crafted characters, and a beautifully designed setting that immerses you deeply into its world, Life is Strange: True Colors is a superb entry into the Life is Strange series. While the game's conclusion does come just slightly too quickly, and some technical issues spoil the show, you won't regret experiencing Alex Chen's story. Simply put, Life is Strange: True Colors is a must-play.",,"Life Is Strange: True Colors is a return to form for the franchise, which delivers a captivating story from start to finish, one that will see you go through all the emotions. Just like Alex Chen herself.","Life is Strange: True Colors is an experience that can be appreciated in the sweetness of its journey, sublimated by shimmering colors, animations more accomplished than ever and very beautiful melodies. With this episode, Deck Nine Games chose to explore empathy from top to bottom; a preponderant aspect in the powers granted, the narration and the construction of the characters. The whole provides a very neat adventure on a human level, but which undeniably lacks a certain liveliness in its actions and the unfolding of the plot. The result is an investigation that lacks a certain panache.",,,"The game performed well on my Series X, the artwork, music and voice acting is of the usual high calibre and fans of the universe will find this entry as enjoyable to play as any of the others that have gone before it.",,Life is Strange: True Colors lands itself as one of the most cathartic and emotionally resonant video games I've played in a long time.,,,,"Life is Strange: True Colors is another good installment in the series. However, there are some flaws. The setting is far too small and you will find yourself visiting the same locations time after time. Next to that, there are some flaws in the story. Although the writing is good, the game loses focus once in a while and lets you LARP instead of looking for clues. Overall it's just a good popcorn game, but not more than that.",,"Life is Strange: True Colors may sadly dim towards the end, but it’s worth checking out alone just to experience Haven Springs, with its gorgeous scenery, terrific cast of characters both major and minor, and an intriguing mystery that requires quite a bit of fun gameplay.",,"Life is Strange: True Colors respects the legacy of its elders. Perhaps too much so. Three years after the last episode by Dontnod Entertainment, Deck Nine Games followed all too well the original recipe. After discovering Alex Chen’s power and the graphical improvement, the novelties to shake up the fans of the licence are scarce. But let them be reassured: all the elements that made the success of the previous episodes are right there. The pleasure of discovering Haven Springs, its mysteries and its inhabitants is real and the emotion does not falter. Nevertheless, the technique as well as the freedom of action and the staging are outdated and hard to ignore. The next game in the saga must take more risks, whether in terms of the themes tackled or the diversity of the exploration phases or else, the tide will shift from an emotional game to a boring one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A beautiful setting, convincing characters and a handful of heartwarming and heartbreaking moments make up for the inconsistent story and messy pace of True Colors.

Fans of the series and newcomers will definitely enjoy this.",,"Life is Strange: True Colors is a “must-play” for all those that played the first title and felt that something was missing in the second. It’s a game of landmark events, strong emotions and tough decisions.

Having the risk of becoming one more death, Alex does not give up on bringing justice and truth to all those that accompany her, including you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Life is Strange: True Colors creates a world that players will want to be in, and a story that needs to be seen to the end.

yakuza-like-a-dragon,,,,,"Despite the host of new features and ideas, Yakuza: Like a Dragon on Xbox is still quintessentially a Yakuza title. The humour is still here, as are the plot twists on plot twists, and of course the karaoke, which all add up to make it one of the stronger ‘launch’ titles on the Xbox Series X|S. There is a noticeable graphical improvement over previous titles on the Xbox One too; Ijincho is a gorgeous addition to the city roster and returning cities have never looked better.","An unexpectedly solid reboot of a long standing series.

It won't please anyone and the new turn-based combat system can use some improvements, but this is definitely a game to not overlook.","Yakuza: Like a Dragon is not only one of the best games of the year, but also RGG Studio brings us one of the best JRPGs of the modern era that knows how to pay tribute to the classics but building its own legend, as Ichiban does with Kiryu.",,,,"Frustrating at times, the fault of a too present farming, but constantly disorienting, this new episode makes us go through all the emotions, from laughter to tears, from epic to big no matter what. “Yakuza, it's stronger than you!”",,,,,,,,,"Yakuza Like a Dragon is a must play for fans of the first hour. Side missions compliment the main story in a major way thanks to the utter insanity of some of the stories.

As much as I enjoyed the Yakuza formula, it was definitely a formula. Like a Dragon has enough familiar elements to make it feel like, at its heart, it’s a Yakuza game. All the while, I fully appreciated how much of a new identity this entry is establishing. Here’s hoping this is the first step in yet another great journey for the series.",,,,,,Yakuza Like a Dragon is one of the best RPGs of the year.

[Issue#353, p.100]","With that being said, Like a Dragon is easily more than the sum of its parts. Although it can be drawn out, the story has some incredibly emotional moments that really resonate and will likely end up being some of the most memorable of the entire year, and it's propped up by a cast that's equally relatable and charming. Whether you've stormed the streets of Kamurocho before or are completely new to the dealings of the Tojo Clan, there is so much to appreciate in this game if you're willing to be patient.","Yakuza: Like A Dragon is a fresh update of Sega's crazy gangster simulator. The new combat system is varied and really entertaining. The balance between the seriousness of the story and the humorous elements is excellent, and the new protagonist Ichiban is convincing. But unfortunately, the real ""next-gen"" elements are absent. Static environments and non-animated mouths should not occur at all in the year 2020.",,,"This one definitely won’t be for all tastes, but players with a penchant for Japanese culture and a love of tactical combat are bound to find a little slice of criminal soap opera heaven in Yakuza: Like a Dragon.",,,,,"Yakuza Like a Dragon is a success on almost every level: its turn-by-turn fighting system manages to hook the player while enhancing the experience of die-hard fans. In addition, the very solid storyline takes us once again to a new neighborhood for a total change of scenery. However, we would have liked Yakuza 7 to strengthen its game by offering more challenges for those who are already familiar with the Japanese role-playing genre. To do so, we will have to rely on a DLC pack including a hard mode upon release: a particularly clumsy decision from our point of view.",,"What a wild ride it is. I didn't want Yakuza: Like a Dragon to end. A part of me wonders if I grinded out battles and business minigames more than was intended, simply because I wasn't ready to say goodbye to Ichiban and friends. Fortunately, the story wraps up nicely and leaves the door open for a possible sequel — even though it wavers a bit near the end. This isn't farewell to Ichiban. With a new cast of charming characters, Like A Dragon feels like the start of a new saga in the Yakuza franchise. Until next time, Kasuga-kun.",,,,,,,,"As the Yakuza franchise is still trying to become a household franchise in the West, the Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio decided to flip the switch and create a turn-based RPG. The result of that experiment, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, is a resounding success. The ""dynamic RPG"" gameplay fits the Yakuza universe and tropes like a glove and its mechanics are surprisingly deep. And the fact that the game's new characters are lovable doesn't hurt. The turn-based gameplay will probably put off some gamers but Yakuza: Like a Dragon truly deserves a shot. The Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio made the JRPG genre proud.",,,,,"For RGG Studio's first crack at an RPG, it's a damn fine result. It delivers what I love most about Yakuza and introduces new ideas that largely pay off. Ichiban isn't doing it alone, either. He has friends and mentors, ones who've helped him fight and overcome personal tragedies. It was an absolute thrill to watch him grow, and that's what's most important for a game so focused on its characters. Yakuza: Like a Dragon is a passing of the torch, and a fantastic entry in a beloved franchise that proves that it's in good hands with Kasuga Ichiban.","Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has topped themselves once again with Yakuza: Like a Dragon! This new take on Yakuza brings a lot of fun, new ideas to the table while remaining its heartfelt self.

While the hardware power isn’t in doubt, at this point, it serves more as a performance boost than a paradigm shift. From that point of view, Like a Dragon is a great game to have available on day one. It’s a fresh take on the Yakuza series, it’ll keep you occupied for a long time, and it runs better than ever before.",,,,,,,,"Yakuza: Like a Dragon does exactly as hoped and brings a whole new audience to the series with a reinvention of sorts. It plays well, looks great, and has one of the simplest stories to understand fronted by Ichi, the most likeable protagonist so far.

If you are a long time Yakuza fan, take comfort in knowing that even in a new direction this not only holds up, but is the best in the series. For newcomers, go and grab one of the games of the year. Consider this reviewer converted.",,"Yakuza: Like A Dragon is a rousing success. The timing is excellent, too. It’s the dawn of a new console generation and it’s an exciting time for this storied franchise to turn a new page. As far as launch games go, this is one of the best, for several reasons. It offers some presentation ‘wows,’ but even more importantly it offers a deep, long, compelling story with memorable moments and characters, with strong gameplay and lots to do. It’s built off of the success of the previous fifteen years of Yakuza, but Like A Dragon blazes its own path, too — you need not have played any of the previous games to fully enjoy this one, yet I appreciate that this game honors the past while forging its own future. PS5 owners have something great to look forward to in March, but if you’re lucky enough to have the new Xbox, this is a great game that is also very well priced right now at just $50.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My 40 hours in Yakuza: Like a Dragon were a great experience regardless if I was playing on my original Xbox One or seamlessly transitioning my save onto the Xbox Series X for improved resolution, frame rate, and loading times. I loved its characters, humor, and willingness to balance complete absurdity with utter sincerity. And even though the battle system would occasionally trip over its own feet, I still adored watching my crew beat the hell out of some weirdos, grow a little bit closer, and celebrate their victory with karaoke back at the pub.",,,,"Yakuza: Like a Dragon’s switch to turn-based RPG combat and team-based tactics may bite off more than it can chew thanks to terrible difficulty spikes and ill-defined character progression, but it’s still a breath of fresh air for the series.

subnautica-below-zero,,,,,"Subnautica: Below Zero is an excellently designed survival experience. It’s a place where the most creative can utilise the tools that they find, going out, exploring and creating a whole world under the sea. It’s helped by a cracking story that sits perfectly alongside this adventure of a lifetime. Admittedly, initial moments are confusing, but once you get into the rhythm of things and understand the resource hunting, it all becomes second nature.","Subnautica: Below Zero retains all the key gameplay elements that gave its predecessor its success, and furthermore adds various improvements -although its significantly smaller map area and its design deprive it of the feelings of loneliness, fear and awe as you enter a new biome.","The narrative, a desperate search, the great mysteries of planet 4546B and the surprises that we will find in it are a great incentive to play this Subnautica.",,,,,,"Subnautica: Below Zero offers a more immediate, accessible and complete gaming experience compared to the first chapter of the saga, providing a more impactful and suitable title for those who do not like too dispersive survival games. To succeed in this, however, many aspects of the original title have been simplified, resulting in a less meaty and varied game. A different experience then, but worth the effort.",,,,,"Subnautica Below Zero does not seem to want to walk in other steps than that of its big brother. By reducing the map or vehicles, Below Zero is more to be seen as a very good expansion of the original game, more scripted version and a little more hostile than the first episode. If Below Zero undoubtedly does better than the competition when it comes to making a scripted survival game, with a universe as enchanting as it is frightening hand-crafted, it would undoubtedly have gained more from the experience of 'origin to fully conquer the veterans of the franchise, who, despite everything, will take undeniable pleasure to go diving again, just like the newcomers, who will have the chance to discover for the first time this atypical and oh so immersive way of approaching the game of survival.",,"A new funny and survival adventure in an alien ocean by Unknown Worlds, a really talented develop team which brings us to the colder side of 4546B.",,,,,,,,,,,"Subnautica: Below Zero could be compared to an iceberg. Hidden underneath a seducing art direction, its many treasures are only available to those who are ready to truly invest some time in the game.

Subnautica: Below Zero is the most refreshing, engaging sandbox game I’ve played in ages and there’s no reason why you shouldn’t dive right in.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Subnautica: Below Zero is an excellent game, held back mostly by the inevitable comparison to its groundbreaking predecessor. This sequel doesn’t change much but deepens the focus on storytelling combined with above-water exploration. This is no doubt one of the best survival games I’ve ever played, which is why I would have loved to see more of it, more vehicles, an even more ambitious story with actual NPCs and a world that didn’t feel so familiar after playing the previous game. Either way, this is an absolute must-play for any fan of the original and a good starting point for anyone who found Subnautica’s pacing too slow.",,,,,,,"Subnautica: Below Zero is a great follow-up to one of the best in the genre. It dishes out the survival aspects in more digestible chunks than some of the more extreme cases.

These kind of games on PC are relatively common from time to time, but on consoles this exotic genre is like a gem you can enjoy one time every decade -or even more-. These kind of games are not for everyone. Despite its magnificent possibilities and eternal endgame, it's very complex to learn how to play from start and you will spend several hours reading and playing tutorials or getting unlimited hints in order to actually get some small improvements on your walkthrough. Surprisingly no option for keyboard and mouse, despite the fact that many games are already including this compatibility option without any issues.",,,,"A gigantic medieval sandbox, Crusader Kings III has no equivalent. Insanely deep, the new nugget from Swedish developers Paradox takes strategy and RPG to the top.

Each part is a discovery and leads to sometimes unsuspected decisions.

Without denying its origins, Crusader Kings III sublimates the franchise and leads us to bow to it. Remarkable.",,"It was very difficult to translate all of the systems of Crusader Kings 3 for console play and Paradox has done its best, but many UX choices are inexplicable and this port will not help newcomers to approach this great strategy game.","Crusader Kings III is a phenomenal game that is not for most.

Even though the gameplay experience is inferior to the maximum settings on a PC, it doesn’t need to be ashamed of the comparison and comes much closer than anyone dared to hope thanks to a clever use of the controller. Those fond of large strategy games or medieval history should definitely give this game a try, especially since it has been available in the Xbox Game Pass since its release. Crusader Kings III is a must-have in its category and offers a wealth of roleplay.

resident-evil-village,,"Overall, there’s a lot to like about Resident Evil Village. The story and characters are great, most of the scenarios are fantastic fun to play, and when it hits best it rivals the top tier of the franchise. It’s a little too action heavy for my tastes, but even so that action is generally a lot of fun. Is it the best in the series? No. Is it still bloody good? One hundred percent. I’m cautiously excited to see where we go from here, and am already looking forward to a second playthrough.",,"Resident Evil Village may not quite live up to the highs of its terrifying predecessor but it's a still a solid entry in the long-running series that's well worth checking out. Eastern Europe makes for a fantastically atmospheric and surprisingly open setting here, it's chock full of delightfully oddball characters and features a handful of properly entertaining set-pieces to blast through. There may well be a few rough edges, with a rather painful protagonist and some duff boss battles to contend with but, overall, this is one truly messed up village that's well worth a visit.","Resident Evil Village is worth every cent. If you loved Resident Evil 7: Biohazard then you’ll be ecstatic about being able to step back into the shoes of Ethan Winters in this new title. This is a game that is worth every penny, offering up a great blend of horror and action alongside some superb character development.","While not without faults and with a strangely out of character last section, Resident Evil Village is simply one of the finest moments for the series, mixing together a wonderfully dark atmosphere with tense action and sweet morsels of horror and despair.",Pretty much the strongest AAA so far this year. Resident Evil VIII Village is a must-have.,,,,,,"Resident Evil Village is an incredible piece of work, capable of keeping us glued to the screen for the entire story. Although there are some flaws that make it closer to an excellent game rather than a masterpiece, we recommend everyone to play it as it's a good product in almost all aspects, which could also make you approach the saga for the first time.","Resident Evil Village is a game that takes a risk and a new evolution of the concept of the series that Capcom started out with Resident Evil VII. Despite its flaws, Village is a great Resident Evil experience that will scare you and make you experience typical Resident Evil moments.",,,"Enjoyable in a mad, pantomime sort of way, Resident Evil Village feels like a pretty significant step back from Resident Evil VII, and a toe back into the absurd. It's a game you're unlikely to forget in a hurry, for entirely the wrong reasons.","More accomplished than its predecessor from whom it shamelessly steals its structure, Resident Evil Village is a complete experience filling with quiet strength all the necessary boxes for the success of an action-oriented first-person survival horror. Although it draws its inspiration from the depths of the Spanish oblivion belonging to the fourth installment, the title of Capcom manages to perform well thanks to its atmosphere tinged with original fantasy for the saga. The unforgivable absence of virtual reality and the presence of a feeling of ""already played"", however, prevent him from claiming the title of eminent village chief. Not enough to initiate a parochial dispute, however: this new Resident Evil is a success.",,,,,"Resident Evil Village is a great game that embraces the elements of the series that we know and love while also carving out its own space nestled deep in dark fantasy. In fact, this game beautifully finds a middle ground to please existing fans of the franchise but also serves as a great entry point for new players.",,,,,,,,"“Hamlet isn’t (quite) dead.” Capcom has worked tremendously hard to turn this Resident Evil Village into the new spearhead of action-horror games. Technically flawless and carefully paced, the experience never runs out of steam even though sometimes, we’d like to stop and enjoy the scenery to find all the secrets it hides. This opus definitely sends the previous one back to its scrappy status by brilliantly taking over the first-person view and its characteristics to generate great moments of stress and fear. The in-game breaks are well managed and the build-up to the inevitably gritty and unsubtle finale is not a disappointment here: far from it. Doing better than this in the future will be no easy task, but at least when putting the controller down, we thought about how memorable this experience had been and how we’d like to go for seconds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Resident Evil 7 was an excellent return to the horror underpinnings of the franchise, but cunningly altered with new ideas and a new perspective. Similarly, Village is an intelligent reintroduction of the best action elements of Resident Evil. Though it captures some of the same things that made RE7 such a breath of fresh air (or maybe rancid, stale, mold-filled air, but in a good way), Village evolves to become its own unique creature. It makes you wonder what beautifully twisted fiend Resident Evil might mutate into in the future.",,,,,,,,,,"Resident Evil Village is a decent entry into a franchise that continues to wildly swing back and forth, stumbling into success and failure, unsure of what it even wants to be.",,,,,,,,Resident Evil Village is another outstanding entry in one of the best franchises in gaming. Capcom has done a wonderful job of keeping the series fresh and interesting since its inception back in 1996. I still get excited when a new game in the series drops.

It's a game that doesn't hold the player by hand, and for this reason it can often leave you stumped requiring a lot of tenacity and patience, but it can also offer great rewards. Recommended for survival game fans and newbies alike, especially those eager to enjoy it with friends.","I feel that Grounded was able to take advantage of its long trial period to provide the content that was missing in its initial version. The changes in the quality of life, the fact that the swimming mechanics have been added, having a whole new biome with new enemies, improvements in construction, among other things, contributed to enrich the survival side of Grounded to make it one of the first options for fans of the genre. In addition, the narrative content of the game has enriched it in such a way that now you have an interesting story that you discover the more you explore and a real mission: to return to your natural state, escaping the limitations of measuring an inch. Visually the game stands out for its art, graphics and lighting. Sonically it doesn't disappoint either.",,,,,,,,,"Grounded provides some great survival mechanics and challenging combat in a rather novel environment with an intriguing plotline. The game can be very tough but also very rewarding. However, it can take a while to really get the game going with the analysis mechanic and the lack of explanation revolving around many other ludemes.",,,,,,"Much like the protagonists, Grounded sees Obsidian heading into new brand new territory that’s still familiar in some ways, and their expedition ends up paying off big-time. Excelling as a survival game with a nice and meaty challenge, an adventure game with a lot of secrets and goods to hunt for and a highly-enjoyable story, and a visual spectacle as you wander around and take in the eye-popping sights of now-majestic backyard clutter (and the more frightening sights of the impressive and imposing insects), this is one trip that’s tiny yet epic at the same time and is not to be missed out on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Grounded has always been a solid idea on paper, but Obsidian brings that potential to full fruition for launch, delivering on the thrills and fun of its brilliantly Spielbergian conceit.","Grounded is a fantastic survival game with a killer premise, rewarding progression, and boundless creativity that even a host of bugs can’t spoil.",,,,,,"Grounded is a very remarkable survival RPG that is only taking its first (and tiny) steps. It has a huge potential to become one of the must-haves of the genre, but it already has enough to make survival fans fall in love with it. Give it a chance if you can, because it deserves it.",,,,,,,,"Grounded remains strictly tied to its survival roots, but the strange and fanciful setting defines it as a peculiare game and can be a major selling point. Although it's clearly an experiment on uncharted waters for the team, Obsidian brings a peculiar touch to this genre.",,,"Grounded is a complete, well-finished and multifaceted project, capable of satisfying a wide audience both for its setting and for its mechanics. Perhaps the two-year preview had a ""cooling"" effect on the interest of the public, but they did very well to the final result. Net of some frustrating elements, such as a difficulty level that looks upwards if it can, and the lack of a couple of mechanics useful for those who want to enjoy the game with maximum ease - fast travel for example - Grounded it is a product that if it had been released today, without first knowing anything about it, would certainly be the center of a lot of attention. If solo is a solid game, challenging but potentially difficult to digest in its entirety, in cooperative the experience shows its best side and is able to offer many hours.","For its part, the gameplay of Grounded presents us with a cycle that constantly rewards us with new items, construction plans, and improvements that make exploration extremely addictive. You can spend days building your main base, collecting materials, and knowing the garden like the back of your hand before you even look for BURG.L for the first time, or embark on an expedition that's as complicated as you like. While there is room for improvement on a couple of elements, the base experience is extremely solid, and one of the most fun I've had the opportunity to experience all year.","This final release for Grounded confirms that Obsidian gave its soul to the game, crafting a survival game which is still improvable, but unique in a lot of ways.",,,,,,"When the imagination knows no bounds, numerous bugs, a frustrating level of difficulty and strange design decisions bother even more.",,,,,"Grounded has become, over the years, a real gem that has little to envy to what we expect from Avowed.",,,"Ultimately, how much you enjoy Grounded is going to depend on how you play and if you choose to enable any of the customization options. In the default state, if you're looking to adventure through the story, you'll have a fun time, but Grounded is at its best when played as a survival sim. Focus on exploring the world, and let the story happen in the background. It may be a slower pace, but it's also more rewarding.","Grounded offers a good survival for all audiences, but without forgetting those who are looking for something more.",,,,"Grounded is an impressive entry in the survival game genre and one where the setting of being tiny in a suburban backyard amplifies its strengths as well as the stuff that we’ve all seen before in other titles. There’s just something fulfilling about hacking away at a thistle stem and using the falling debris to craft arrows - and then using said arrows to take out fireflies at night and then using those materials to create a makeshift mining helmet equipped with a torch. Even though the default settings feel overly punishing, and grind-y in terms of crafting, Obsidian does let you make your own rules - which for any time spent playing games in a backyard setting, is a definite plus.",,,,,"The full release of Grounded is impressive due to its polish, attention to detail, and unique, compelling premise and world, but is still in need of some work to reach its full potential as a giant of the survival genre.","If you are in the mood to try out something new in the survivalist genre, Grounded may be the game you are looking for due to its unique shrunken environment and formidable enemies. All things considered, I can’t wait to see what will happen next in this first-person narrative from Xbox Game Studios.",,"Grounded isn't the biggest game of its kind, and most of its moment-to-moment gameplay moments have been seen before in other games. Still, the fantastical setup makes for an immediately intriguing setup, and to further stylize it as a uniquely child-like adventure, polish it beyond most of its peers, and set it in a world full of familiar sights to see in startling new ways makes Grounded no small feat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Grounded's charming, Honey I Shrunk the Kids premise is elevated by its uniquely welcoming approach to wonder. [Eurogamer Recommended]",,,,,,"Grounded captivated me with its survival layer and the atmosphere of its wonderful miniature world. Then it discouraged me with a couple of ill-considered design choices, including ones that artificially extend its length in a tiring manner. Ultimately, however, I kept coming back to Obsidian’s game not because I had to, but because I wanted to. Despite having devoted 60 hours to Grounded, I can’t shake the feeling this backyard still holds many secrets and I’m eager to discover them.",A great survival game that makes you feel the terror fighting against bugs. [Recommended],,,,,,,,,,,,,Grounded changed the ordinary backyard into an intense place where you can't see what's coming next by simply adding a concept of shrunk kids. The sandbox game with survival and variety of crafting elements is always fun whether you are playing alone or with friends.,,,,,,,"Grounded has great ideas and delivers a truly entertaining experience. It is one of those games that are made for you to start a game and get lost for hours while you get resources, improve your tools and build the best base of all together with your friends. What started as a small and crazy idea evolved into an exceptional survival that shines with great strength.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gears-tactics,"Even though Gears Tactics is a shock to the franchise’s core gameplay, the new strategic take still works for its unique setting. It may not play like any Gears that you’re used to, but it still fits and feels like a true entry into the series without feeling forced. While I could have done without the padded side missions, Gears Tactics still has amazing visuals, writing, gameplay and everything else that fans have come to love about the series. Super fans will obviously get the most from its narrative as it has deep ties into the series’ overall narrative, though strategy game fans can jump in and still enjoy the experience without being a Gear-head.",,,,,,,,"Gears Tactics gets a no-nonsense port to Xbox One and Series X|S, feeling at home on console and looking great on Series X in particular. Jack's wide-ranging buffs and abilities give a helping hand through the Jacked campaign, but in either mode, this is a slick turn-based tactical game that should appeal to XCOM and Gears fans alike.",,,,"Gears Tactics offers a fine blend of strategy and action, capable of captivating a wide range of players with a satisfying plot perfectly integrated into Gears of War's lore. A game that all lovers of strategy games and the Gears universe should play, and that we'd love to see followed by other titles in the series.",Gears Tactics is pure Gears but exploring new horizons in gameplay. The strategy gameplay suits the Gears saga very well and Gabe Diaz is a very interesting character who brings us an old fashioned Gears story.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sure, it does falter due to the frequently repetitive side quests that damage the pacing, but it remains an absolute joy. Gears Tactics offers a different pace for Gears fans, but at the same time, the same amount of gratifying combat they’ve come to expect.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Gears Tactics makes an odd choice turning away from the main genre that the Gears of War series is well known for but still captures that vital essence that fans have come to love. Playing this game on the Xbox Series X in 4k resolution is an amazing experience for any Gears fans or lovers of strategy games. The gameplay feels incredibly natural running on console and offers a really immersive experience for anyone. I’m especially fond of how much of the lore and content from the Gears series has been used in this game, especially the cinematic aspects that occur when executing a downed enemy. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has ever played a Gears of War game or is looking for a challenging strategy game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The same as the PC version, just a little bit better.","As a spin-off, Gears Tactics has strong core gameplay, but unfortunately, surrounding areas in the design hold it back from being greater. A lack of a base management system or side economy to support the main gameplay makes the gameplay feel a little less rounded and relies heavily on the narrative to keep things from getting stale. The tactical gameplay is excellent, however, its biggest fault is that it left me wanting more.",,,,,,,,,,Gears Tactics offers aggressive and fast-paced turn-based tactics. It works well on console and is enriched with another companion as well as more enemy types.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No gamepad is going to run a turn-based strategy perfectly, but Splash Damage's implementation comes very close. It also makes great use of Quick Resume thanks to its turn-based nature. While it's not worth wholly relying on it at this early stage, leaving a level running in memory instead of playing through an hour-long mission for a second time when the real world beckons seems ideal. Even for those who've already seen Gabe Diaz's story all the way through, the Xbox Series X version is a great way to play it again somewhere down the line.",,,"Jack and the deviant enemies theoretically add a new layer of challenge. Using Jack effectively requires careful coordination; on a good turn, it can clear the path for you to kill more enemies and build even more momentum. Likewise, the Deviant enemies can force you to shift priorities in combat, as they're not only powerful but also make all of your enemies more deadly. At the same time, all of the extra stuff--more moves to make, more enemies to fight--makes each level drag on longer than it needs to. At the start of a new game, you can choose between playing the Jacked campaign with these new features or a Classic campaign. Though I'm still working through the new campaign, I'd argue that the original is a tighter, more satisfying experience. That said, if you've finished the Gears Tactics story and want a new thrill, replaying the campaign with Jack and Deviant enemies is far more interesting than simply running randomly generated veteran missions.","Gears Tactics is a stellar tactics game that still manages to feel like the Gears you know and love. With an okay story, addictive RPG systems, and dozens of hours of gameplay, this is a must-play for any fans of turn-based strategy games or the Gears franchise in general.",,,,,Quotation forthcoming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Unexpectedly, Gears Tactics is quite a competent and enjoyable tactical strategy game. The roots of what make a good tactics game are embedded in the DNA, combat is fun and yet somewhat familiar. However, Gears Tactics falls into the trap of laying down a great foundation with awesome mechanics but it does feel that the few creative ideas showcased begin to feel repetitive after the thirty plus hour campaign. That isn't to say that Gears Tactics is devoid of ideas either, Gears fans will be impressed with how the title pushes forward the narrative and newcomers will also be left in awe at how good the characterisation and cutscenes are, which are just as good as Gears 5, from a graphical and presentation standpoint. This is a great foundation into what should become a great spin-off series, should it continue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gears Tactics is certainly not without its issues, most notably in its mission structure, but nonetheless Splash Damage has created a very solid strategy game that offers a lengthy campaign, beautiful visuals, and fun gameplay mechanics that manage to stay true to the Gears of War franchise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
knockout-city,,,,,"Knockout City is basic on the surface but its core mechanics are able to provide so much fun that you may well struggle to put it down. It’s got all the fundamentals right and with just a bit more content added in, this could be something really special. If you’re looking for a unique spin on the competitive multiplayer angle, it’s absolutely worth a look.",,,,,,,,,"Knockout City bets on playability and fun with a Dodgeball game full of personality. Its map design and special balls enrich a well-designed gameplay. If you like multiplayer games, this one will pleasantly surprise you with its style. It is a solid bet within its genre by EA Originals, more being released on EA Play and Xbox Game Pass.",,,,,,,,,"Knockout City is, indeed, a knockout. It’s absolutely a blast, and despite some small issues, it’s an entirely creative and sharp concept and execution. I only hope the fun lasts after the initial buzz and free play period dies down.",,,,,"Fun but shallow game that may improve over the next few months with more new content, but that at its release time isn't enough to keep you playing for long enough.","Knockout City is easily one of the most pleasant surprises so far this year, managing to turn a game of dodgeball into an addictive and high-octane multiplayer brawl with a unique Zeerust twist in its aesthetics and silky smooth gameplay that anyone can get into. Hopefully it still ends up being a success after the current trial period, because it would be amazing to see just how massive and fun of a city Velan Studios can eventually make.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There are few games that have ever made me scream in anger or shout with unbridled joy as often as Knockout City and I absolutely can’t stop playing. It’s a near-perfect team multiplayer game packed with strategy, heart, and an incredibly impressive level of polish. Even if it’s a bit buggy and lacking in content at the moment, I can’t recommend it enough.",,,,,,,,"I’m shocked with how well Knockout City turned out. It’s easily the biggest surprise of 2021, something everyone should give a go while it’s still free to try.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Knockout City is a blast for tried-and-true online combat fans, thanks to its mix of instantly intriguing and powerful abilities and rock-paper-dodgeball strategy pivots. It's also an incredibly easy recommendation for kids and families, since it finally cracked the nut of an ""online shooter"" that offers the fun of a gun game without in any way resembling gunplay. Its cartoony aesthetic has grown on me, too, thanks to an art team that has balanced simple geometry with bold, enticing designs in a very Nintendo-like way. Assuming EA doesn't screw this up in the months to come, expect Knockout City to land on my list of 2021's best games of the year.

Filled with story and side missions, large open hubs, minigames, and literally hundreds of characters to unlock, Skywalker Saga hits nearly every beat while maintaining the brick-smashing, object-building, puzzle-solving action the Lego games are known for. Filled with irreverent humor and little Easter eggs around every corner, this game is the perfect way to revisit everyone’s favorite sci-fi family saga.","It always felt like LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga would struggle to live up to its lofty promise of delivering essentially the most expansive Star Wars game to date, but the team at TT Games really have done an amazing job on it. We've still got a few nitpicks, and we also wish it included online co-op support, but there's no denying that it's a stunningly beautiful and brilliantly ambitious take on the world of Star Wars complete with endlessly enjoyable gameplay and enough side-content to keep you busy for many, many hours to come. We've been waiting so long for this game to arrive, and we're pleased to report the Force is definitely strong with this one.",LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga oozes the feel good factor. It’s a comprehensively charming and loving tribute to the source material that also happens to be the biggest and best LEGO game to date.,"Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a love letter to the franchise and a game Lego and Star Wars fans have been waiting for since the Lego franchise’s first visit to George Lucas’ universe.

With hundreds of hours ahead, you will enjoy playing solo, or with someone else.","With close to 400 characters and well over 1,000 optional objectives all spread out across 45 varied story missions and dozens of fully explorable locations all over the Star Wars galaxy, it's an absolute love letter to the sci-fi franchise. It might not put up too much of a fight but it doesn't really need to in order to stay engaging, with ever-changing gameplay and a seemingly endless supply of gags to help it feel fresh all the way from The Phantom Menace's title card to The Rise of Skywalker's credits. Also, I got to play as Jar Jar Binks in 2022. What a time to be alive.",,"What could have so easily been a retread of previous LEGO Star Wars games, has more than its fair share of new ideas. The Skywalker Saga offers a greatest hits compilation of all nine films, wrapped up in signature knockabout comedy, with enjoyable and uncomplicated, though sometimes slightly dull, gameplay. Bottom line is, I'm a sucker for a LEGO Star Wars game. Sign me up. Again.","LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is an experience that is both very family-friendly and accessible.

There are so many new welcome additions that I hope become staples for the future. But there are just as equal parts that felt unnecessary. These 3 years since the LEGO games last release and recent revelations were hopefully taken in as a learning experience.,"LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is the definitive LEGO Star Wars experience. It’s the only game that contains all nine of the main films in LEGO format and it will also include some content from Rouge One, Solo, The Mandalorian, and The Bad Batch via DLC. The iconic LEGO game humor is everywhere. The destruction of all LEGO items in an area does get a little repetitive after a while, however, the collectables will keep you playing for hours on end.

Visually stunning, mechanically evolved, and endlessly entertaining, the game puts its foot on the gas and never lets off. Pacing issues and simplicity aside, the fact that the devs could revisit games they literally already made and make this package feel fresh is an accomplishment all its own. No matter how players might feel about the stories of the three trilogies, it’s hard to argue this is the best video game representation of them that just so happens to be LEGO.","LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga turned out to be an exciting, though not an ideal game for the whole family. It offers a large amount of content, but it is obvious that the developers did not cope with the scale of their creation.",,"It’s just very easy and bite-sized in the grand scheme of it all. None of the cool ideas are ever fully fleshed out and it tends to feel one-note after a while.

If there was ever to be a Skywalker Saga: The Video Game ‘proper’, it wouldn’t have a chance to let players experience all the wild wonders of the universe like this. A movie-faithful adaptation wouldn’t let you run around Hoth as General Grievous alongside Yaddle and, in all honestly, that's all I’ve ever wanted.","A new step but not a revolution for the LEGO Games formula.

The level of polish visually and care put into this version feels like they truly went back to the drawing board and created the ultimate LEGO game.

Star Wars is silly. Star Wars is epic. Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga knows this and embraces both aspects, while being a lot of fun and very funny. It’s one of my favorite games of 2022, and while some hardcore Star Wars fans may be loathe to admit it, yes, this is probably the best Star Wars game yet made.",,,,"All in all, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga has sadly been a frustrating experience for me. World design and presentation, with John William's classic score and the beautiful graphics, are top notch, but the gameplay and quest design got redundant only after few hours.",,,,,,"A fantastic and bombastic return to the galaxy far, far away, LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga is a massively exciting game.

In addition, Digital Eclipse has brought games for all tastes and ages.",,,"Like any collection of retro titles, however, much of the appeal lies in the innate nostalgia factor to players of a certain age, and on that front I'm not even sure I need to make a case for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection – it's immediately apparent that every one of the games included in Konami's comprehensive TMNT bundle is imbibed with 8- and 16-bit loveliness: the perfect way for NES, SNES, Game Boy, and Mega Drive/Genesis owners to time travel, and, furthermore, the perfect way for twelve-year-olds to play the Turtles' arcade highlights, without getting an angry letter sent home to their parents.","The Cowabunga Collection frankly lives up to the expectations placed on it. Despite its status as a “simple” compilation, the work of the Digital Eclipse studio is a lesson for all publishers who bring out the old things of the past. If the 13 games do not show the same interest, we can only bow to the avalanche of options and bonuses integrated into this compilation. Admittedly, some productions have aged and the lifespan is not enormous, but the user-friendliness is there and in the field of compilations, this Cowabunga Collection holds the dragee high for the tenors of the genre. In such conditions, it is difficult not to be seduced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is a must-play title for retro game lovers or turtle fans. Having all these games from all the different consoles in one collection is amazing — so much easier than pulling out and hooking up all the systems!,,,,,,,,,,,,"TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection is a treasure trove of Turtle games, but our online experience was barely functional when matchmaking. Couch co-op fares a lot better, but some may notice an increased input delay over the originals. All said this is still a great collection for fans.",,"Another fantastic retro compilation from Digital Eclipse that celebrates the golden era of TMNT games with the level of respect they deserve. Newcomers may find a couple of the games haven't aged too well, though, and while there's a huge gallery it doesn't provide as much narrative as we'd have liked.",,,,,,,,"If the great TMNT: Shredder's Revenge still hasn't quenched your hunger for ninja turtles, with The Cowabunga Collection prepare yourself for indigestion: Digital Eclipse has done a really good job in re-adapting 13 products that have made the history of the Konami series. Some titles have aged well, others a little less (especially the GameBoy ones). In short, for all those teenagers who grew up at the turn of the eighties and nineties with the myth of Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo and Donatello, it is a recommended purchase but some might turn up their noses at the launch price of this collection, proposed at 40 euros.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Cowabunga Collection becomes a new gold standard for this type of retro collections.

I had a mild interest in baseball but I can see myself following the sport a lot closer based on how much fun I have had so far in this game.

There's a welcome 'Casual' preset for beginners, the gameplay is more enjoyable than ever, and newcomers will likely be overwhelmed (in a good way) at the sheer amount of content at their disposal. Road to the Show's new Ballplayer integration won't satisfy everyone, and needs a few tweaks, but it's nevertheless still a highly enjoyable mode to play, and the likes of Diamond Dynasty and March to October are excellent options as well.

Also, while it includes some major gameplay updates, it took more effort in this regard.",,,,"MLB The Show's 2021 vintage isn't a strike out, far from it. The title of Sony San Diego does not revolutionize its formula, but refines it in depth, from the more readable interface to the new very complete stadium editor, including the addition of the cross-platform and a perfect cloud backup. The heart of the game is still beating strong, namely a very faithful transcription of the major leagues by adding dynamism and variety in the realization to the clear and customizable gameplay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"MLB The Show 21 lacks flash and new experiential paths this season, but continues to improve on the field and beneath the hood, giving an entirely new audience of players a hell of a game to begin their baseball careers with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Much like its predecessors, MLB The Show 21 is still one of the best sports games available once you step over the foul line. The gameplay has been tightened up and Pinpoint Pitching is a potential game-changer, and all of these elements go some way to dampening the disappointment of its missing features, stale commentary, and changes (or lack thereof) to Road to the Show and Franchise. It's not the strongest debut the series could've had on new hardware, but if you're in the mood for nine innings of America's favorite pastime, MLB The Show is still the undisputed king.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
motogp-22,"Without this new exciting career mode I probably would have bailed on MotoGP 22 long before, but seeing documentary footage and racing as iconic legends of the sport was truly exciting. Hardcore MotoGP fans will most likely love this new mode, especially since they’ve made this casual fan a larger one because of it. While MotoGP 22 might be a harder sell for the fans that purchase it every year and know that there’s only incremental updates, this is probably a great entry to dive in for those on the fence or have skipped a few years of entries.","Overall, if you look to MotoGP as your go-to racer of the year, then 2022’s effort certainly won’t be a bad way to spend your time. If you’re looking for innovation and a unique experience, however, the new NINE season will surely be a breath of fresh air, but with flaws of its own, there is very little to warrant an entire £60 worth here, and you’d probably feel a lot happier picking this one up with a little knocked off the total price.

The superb 'NINE Season 2009' mode, meanwhile, is worth the price of admission alone.","It's a small jump that Milestone offers with MotoGP 22. The official simulation of the world motorcycle speed championship is better made than the previous part, but does not manage to take the series to a new level. The fault with a graphic quality in game, with an engine which begins to age without forgetting that the license stagnates in the animations and its career mode. However, the title manages to bring interest with its new ""Season Nine"" mode retracing the mythical 2009 season, a convincing artificial intelligence and a split screen finally available. The Italian studio limits the damage, the benchmark title for MotoGP will wait.","MotoGP 22 is a phenomenal addition to the franchise. The career mode will keep you busy for hours, and the other modes are equally as good. It's tough to master but the driving aids help casual players get up to speed. An excellent addition to the series even if it rehashes some much-loved elements.",,,,,,,,,,,,"MotoGP 22 doesn’t revolutionise the recipe and simply heats up its old leftovers gameplay-wise. It brings some improvements here and there, but its visuals are getting outdated. However, its playable documentary NINE, which is a nice surprise, avoids the shipwreck.

dirt-5,"While previous DIRT fans might not be so sure about its arcade direction this time around, for everyone else, it’s an accessible and fun racing game that doesn’t take itself too seriously. If you happened to get one of the new consoles, playing DIRT 5 in framerate mode is how you can showcase what your new TV can or can’t do. While there’s not much length to the career mode, Playgrounds allows you to create or play anyone else’s track, adding longevity, even if the overall package is a little light on substance.",,,,,,,,,,,,DIRT 5 refreshes the arcade rally series with a challenging and very engaging racer.

So what are you waiting for? Get your motor running!",,,,,,,"Dirt 5 represents a complete about-face for the main Dirt series, shedding virtually all semblance of simulation in favour of an unabashed, arcade-inspired racing experience that draws from just about every influence you can name except its direct predecessor.

DiRT is still DiRT, an episode that takes the best of the first three numbered installments and does not forget to provide the excellent set design of the Rally side. This anarchic philosophy is enjoyed at the controls, but it suffers from a series of technical problems and graphic finishes that are below expectations. A remarkable title specially designed for lovers of the saga and four wheels, but which fails to establish itself as a benchmark in its genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you're the type of person who plays racing games for hundreds of hours, Dirt 5 might let you down and I completely understand why.

marvels-midnight-suns,,"Marvel’s Midnight Suns is a game that you expect quality, and it delivers. When you aren’t crafting and battling with your deck of hero cards there is a deep story to progress and a world to explore. Not only does the exploration feel rewarding but so does the relationships you will be building with your fellow heroes. The best part is these relationships are optional if you are in it just for the card-based battling system, however I implore everyone to give that half of the game a shot. The missions you will be going on are where the game shines the most though. Gathering your favorite heroes and building their decks to work off of each other to pull awesome combos and KO as many enemies in one turn as you can is just so much fun. Very rewarding feeling when you win. Very little in terms of negatives and Marvel’s Midnight Suns is definitely in my game of the year conversations!",,"Marvel's Midnight Suns takes the delightfully deep turn-based tactics of Firaxis' sublime XCOM franchise and adds a slick card battling system to fantastic effect.

With a generous main campaign, unlockable NG+ mode and tons of collectibles and customisation to boot, this one's arrived right at the tail end of 2022 and jumped straight to the upper echelons of our list of the very best games of the year.",Marvel’s Midnight Suns manages to thrill with exciting card-based antics while also ensuring strategic minds prevail.,,"Midnight Suns is possibly the best Marvel superhero game thanks to the great work of Firaxis, who reinvents its formula of success and presents us with an ambitious title with a great turn-based combat system based on cards and skills.",,,,,"Marvel’s Midnight Suns is a both a refreshing, lighthearted take on Firaxis Games’ XCOM formula as well as a shining example of how to faithfully adapt Marvel properties to new game genres that sit outside of the typical action-adventure wheelhouse, propped up by great writing, dialogue, and stellar voice-acting befitting the source material.",,"Marvel's Midnight Suns has been an amazing surprise. This strange mixmatch between an Xcom and a Bioware Game using Marvel characters had all the elements to become some kind of Frankenstein monster, but instead, we find an addictive mixture of genres that, also, give us one of the best combat systems in the RTS genre.",,,"Marvel's Midnight Suns is a strangely complex game to explain. It’s equal parts isometric turn-based RPG, social simulator, and deck-building card game. But you know what? It actually works! Sure, it’s not as tense and as gripping as Firaxis’ XCOM series, but this is a nice action-oriented offshoot.",,,,,,,,"Despite presentation that leaves something to be desired, Marvel’s Midnight Suns packs a ton of interesting strategy into its adventure, and smart writing around the edges helps to offset a main story that feels quite generic. Midnight Suns might be a flawed game in some ways, but I also couldn’t put it down, and it’s the rare game that made me truly want to run around collecting everything. Anyone who loves strategy games or Marvel should absolutely check it out.",,,,,,"Past its lengthy and monotonous introduction, Marvel’s Midnight Suns finally becomes interesting when it gives the player full control. Offering a great deal of relationship management between characters while exploring the Abbey, labelling it simply as a tactical combat game would be too reductive.

The fruit doesn't make sense, but the cake's still pretty good. Still, you're left dreaming of what next year's cake will be like.

A little more animation during the celebrations and on the track with the arrival of the safety car in the race, the addition of events with Supercars to drive and drops in FPS during less significant cutscenes than in 2021, the standing of the latest generation of consoles is finally respected. Codemasters has succeeded in making this new title a reference for multiplayer games with the adjustment to the new rules, the addition of sprint races and a new pit entry system.

Nevertheless, why add the possibility of driving supercars, which will be completely set aside once you have played with them for an hour? F1 fans will focus on the My Team career mode, and particularly on the multiplayer. We were expecting a bit more from the pit stop –a mandatory part of all racing games.

blacktail,"The only real downside to BLACKTAIL is the limited gameplay. It is mostly linear and your skills only expand minimally.

I was surprised to see the sticker price after completing it. While nothing really stands out as new for the gameplay in BLACKTAIL, it has an outstanding setting and fantastic narrative.

With a stunning plot, interesting characters, and slick combat, this is a treat to play. Furthermore, you'll adore the morality mechanic, the awesome dialogue, and the phenomenal world. Sadly, its slow start and repetitive quests hold it back.",,"BLACKTAIL is a well-made, highly polished title that is easy to recommend. Make sure you have the time to properly level up and explore. This beautiful, haunting world is one I hope to come back to time and time again.",,"Players familiar with fast-paced combat and dark depictions of fairy tales will find that Blacktail has a lot to offer. Unfortunately, however, Blacktail often trips over its own feet by trying too hard to create a large variety of gameplay mechanics and easily losing track of the goals of its narrative.",,,,,,,,"We can say with full certainty that Blacktail will remain engraved in our memories. The Polish studio managed to captivate us with the story, the integration of our childhood tales and the beautiful art direction. The interactions between Yaga and the ever-present voice that accompanies her are a real added value in terms of immersion in the universe surrounding us. Unfortunately, not everything is perfect: the bestiary and the AI tend to tarnish the game’s overall image. Despite this, we had a really good time with Yaga. What a success for THE PARASIGHT’s first title!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
immortals-fenyx-rising,"All in all, IMMORTALS FENYX RISING surpassed my expectations. It was a fun and beautiful game, full of exploration, puzzles, combat and humour. Despite being left with wanting more from the combat in the game, I could not stop playing it. Between the humour and the sheer delightfulness of Fenyx, I was captivated and found myself wanting to continue exploring and playing its world more. In the end, it is a game that I can wholeheartedly recommend if you are looking for something new to play this year.",Immortals Fenyx Rising is an enjoyable family-friendly alternative to Assassin’s Creed. The story is enjoyable and if you know a bit about Greek mythology it’s pleasant to see they took the flaws and cruel sides of the Gods rather than glorifying them. The narrative between Zeus and Prometheus is amusing and is a great accompaniment as you progress through the story. There are plenty of different puzzles outside of the main story to keep you busy and makes traversing the open land more enjoyable. The game could have done with more variety in enemies and puzzles to keep the feeling of monotony at bay though.,"If it came out a few months ago or a few months later, Immortals Fenyx Rising might have stood out more. But the problem is that it’s coming after a gauntlet of better Ubisoft products without doing much to improve upon the formula. Sometimes, it actively works against itself in what it’s decided to steal from Breath of the Wild, too. However, its surprisingly engaging story and a late-game trek up a mountain save it from being entirely lost to history.","Immortals Fenyx Rising undoubtedly owes a huge debt to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, borrowing wholesale as it does from its core gameplay mechanics and narrative structure. However, what Ubisoft Quebec has come up with here also adds enough of its own spin on proceedings, with a strong personality and sense of humour sat alongside some brilliantly designed puzzles, flashy, satisfying combat and a huge world full of secrets, treasures and Ancient Greek mythology to discover. It may falter slightly in the final stretch by wrestling away player freedom and funnelling you through its overly long endgame, but this is still a hugely entertaining, technically impressive Ancient Greek romp that's well worth experiencing.","It might not be the biggest or longest open-world, but Immortals Fenyx Rising on Xbox manages to cram a hell of a lot in. It takes huge swathes of inspiration from Breath of the Wild, almost unapologetically so at times. But by also taking cues from Assassin’s Creed and God of War – plus many more – it carves out a little unique space for itself. Whether it is the start of another franchise from Ubisoft remains to be seen, though the DLC plans would suggest a much wider narrative.","Immortals Fenyx Rising comes as a surprise. Tackling on Breath of the Wild tropes and excelling on traversal, puzzle solving and combat, the newest blockbuster by Ubisoft has lots of charm and plays great.",Immortals: Fenyx Rising is a breath of fresh air. It is a game that stands out from its competitors and becomes a must for the generation.,"Immortals is the game many people want Ubisoft to make, focusing just on doing fewer things, but doing them better. This is a great adventure that will challenge our skills and intelligence, and what’s best, won’t waste our time.","Putting the obvious parallels to one side, Immortals Fenyx Rising is a thoroughly enjoyable game. The main character is very likeable, and the humour between the characters is great, while the Golden Isle looks fantastic and is filled with content without also feeling overwhelming. It takes a while for the combat to grow, and the end portion of the game drags on, but if you want a fun and compact open world game then Immortals Fenyx Rising is well worth playing.","Ubisoft created an instant classic with Immortals Fenyx Rising, and I'm eager to see where the franchise goes from here. Its breathtaking art style and landscapes are complemented by fun combat and thoughtful puzzles. While the story itself isn't anything special, the humor imbued within each conversation makes it memorable.",,,"Immortals Fenyx Rising is an enjoyable and fun adventure, with a classic open-world gameplay structure in a fascinating and humourous setting. We would have liked more enemy variety, but even so, it's definitely a game to take in consideration.","Immortals: Fenyx Rising is able to take reference to one of the exponents of its genre and offer a result that wastes personality, with a very complete and fun gameplay, rounded off with his funny sense of humor.","It's not the most original of games, with its basis being literally one of the oldest in the book and its gameplay coming straight out of the Breath of the Wild playbook, but there's a degree of creativity displayed in the storytelling and the activities themselves that really does let Immortals stand apart from its inspirations.",,"Immortals Fenyx Rising is a strange beast, then. Much of it feels very familiar, and you won’t find many things here that haven’t been done before. Yet, it manages to pull together so many different aspects with such proficiency and love for the source material that it’s impossible not to simply enjoy soaking it all up, in an adventure worthy of the Greek heroes of old.","Whether in its gameplay or its structure, Immortals Fenyx Rising will not surprise anyone who has touched a recent open world, that's for sure. Its borrowings from the last Zelda are numerous and glaring, but in the service of a pleasant adventure. Its open world is dense, well built and its scale makes it particularly pleasant to walk. Taking between 20 and 25 hours to see the end of it in a straight line, Immortals does good by providing a pressure-free experience. We will therefore easily recommend it to those who want to discover the game in the open world. Too bad its sometimes catastrophic storytelling interferes with the immersion.",,"Immortals Fenyx Rising conquered us since its debut. Now that we have played it thoroughly, we can say that Ubisoft has given us a small masterpiece better than Watch Dogs Legion and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.",,,,"It’s a pretty joyful take on open-world action, and as far as I’m concerned, it’s a late contender for Game of the Year.",,,"Immortals Fenyx Rising is a refreshing mix between Assassin's Creed and Breath of the Wild. The cartoon style gives it a unique look, while the game combines Greek mythology with puzzles, battling epic enemies, and next-gen looks. The open-world is one to remember, but the narration is one to forget at times. All said and done, this is a game that is not perfect, but deserves a spot between the big releases and definitely a spot in your console.",,,,,,,,"If you’re after an open world experience that’s a little different from Ubisoft’s usual output, Immortals Fenyx Rising is a colourful adventure worth considering. Using Breath of the Wild as its blueprint, this is a mythical adventure with plentiful charm and enough distinct ideas of its own to stand out. It’s a shame that the lacklustre narrative and archaic approach to the genre holds it back from true greatness. Despite such shortcomings, this gorgeously refreshing take on Greek Mythology is crammed with creativity across its impactful combat, engaging puzzle design and lovable cast of characters. As a new franchise, I can only see it growing stronger in the years to come.",,"As far as next-gen titles go, Immortals Fenyx Rising is definitely one you should be adding to your list. It’s available on almost every platform – sorry, mobile gamers – and looks fantastic on the Xbox Series X, which I got to review it on. Overall, it’s a charming, cerebral and funny time-sink adventure that’ll really cheer you up and distract you if you’re having a quiet festive season this year.",,,,"Immortals Fenyx Rising doesn't do anything you haven't seen before, and unless you're married to this particular style of game, it's hard to recommend.",,"Immortals Fenyx Rising is fresh and fun, offering up an exciting new IP I hope to see more of. That said, its endgame pacing issues certainly don’t do it any favours, nor does the timing of its release.","Ubisoft's newest open world game makes a decent debut, but not one without stumbles.",,,,"Immortals Fenyx Rising gives us a gorgeous world to explore, filled with mythological beasts, deities, and powers to wield. Its combat is satisfying, with plenty of choice in upgrades, while its central characters, comedic tone, and storytelling are a real highlight. Seeing Fenyx’s saga through to the end, with amusing commentary from Zeus, Prometheus, and other gods along the way, is a treat. Its Achilles Heel, though, is that so much of the puzzle gameplay feels like going through the motions instead of clever challenges. In the end, I wish Immortals Fenyx Rising had tried to soar just a little higher on the wings of ambition.",Immortals: Fenyx Rising is a wonderfully crafted epic in which Ubisoft Quebec celebrate rather than shay away from their influences to deliver humour and action in equal doses.,,,"Ubisoft has made another bold yet cautious attempt in Immortals Fenyx Rising. It combines the classic Ubisoft mission design with some outstanding ideas from other open-world games. One can't stop noticing some familiar elements within, but Immortals Fenyx Rising can do way better than being a copy cat.",,"Fenyx Rising is a great adventure. An organic open world, full of surprises, with brilliant puzzles and combat mechanics, set in greek mythology. It is not Breath of the Wild, but it is close enough in many (good) things.","Immortals Fenyx Rising offers delightful combat, smooth traversal and outstanding puzzles in an eye-catching, beautiful environment. The almost perfectly executed (and often well-stolen) gameplay, however, is somewhat at odds with the strange tone of the story. Ubisoft Quebec has tried to put a certain whimsy on the characters and dialogue, but I struggle to get caught up in the humour and playfulness of it. Hopefully you can, because if so, you and Mr./Mrs. Fenyx will have an excellent time together.",,,,,"Immortals contains all the ingredients I want from an epic, open-world adventure steeped in mythology. With empowering combat, rewarding exploration, and a story that shines a spotlight on its characters through humor, Immortals Fenyx Rising leverages its myriad inspirations to discover its own identity and deliver an outstanding open-world experience.",,,"Immortals Fenyx Rising is an epic adventure that perfectly leverages the rich, storied history of Greek mythology with a focused and honed version of Ubisoft’s now-ubiquitous open-world design. Deviating from the norm, the game’s unique design and structure help Immortals be one of Ubisoft's most focused adventures and easily one of their most enjoyable yet.",,"It is undeniable that Immortals: Fenyx Rising owes much to Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but it is equally undeniable that the Ubisoft game manages to find its way and to propose its own vision. Those who do not appreciate open-worlds very much, where the fulcrum is the collection of treasures and the completion of challenges, could perceive more than others a sense of repetitiveness, which never becomes boring and which takes advantage of a clean technical realization. I enjoyed every minute spent on the Golden Island and at the end I was sad to say goodbye.","Immortals Fenyx Rising is a great game that shouldn't live in the shadow of Breath of the Wild. Similar to the story between Fenyx and her brother, Ligyron, the new title has shown its full potential, and has managed to excel.",,,"It's just and old-fashioned videogame in contemporary trappings that wants you to enjoy yourself. Play it with a forgiving eye, and you probably will. [Issue#354, p.106]",,,"With its big, engaging world Immortals Fenyx Rising should be the start of a new franchise for Ubisoft. We need more colorful games like this. The humor needs some work, though.",,"Whether you think of Immortals Fenyx Rising as a Breath of the Wild set within Greek mythology, a kid-friendly Assassin’s Creed, or something all its own (likely because you haven’t played either of those other games), the plain fact is that it is eminently playable. There’s never a shortage of things to do, and doing these things is generally a lot of fun. And at the end of the day, that’s pretty much all most folks want out of an open world adventure.",,,,A very fun open world with a lot of puzzles. It takes many references of Breath of the Wild but not enough to find an original place between that title and another traditional open worlds.,"One of the biggest surprises of this final part of the year. Immortals: Fenyx Rising is fun, beautiful, with lots of things to do and plenty of battles to fight. It may get a bit repetitive over the hours, but still worth it. And you'll laugh a lot with Zeus and Prometheus.","One of the surprises of the year. There’s a huge open world full of content waiting for you, and in this world you’ll fight, solve puzzles and enjoy a light-hearted story. And it has Czech subtitles.",,,"Ultimately, Immortals Fenyx Rising may not take itself too seriously but it ends up offering an emotional story of family drama with some genuinely funny moments. There is a lot of familiarity both in the game's DNA and the core gameplay loops, but it is still a fun experience nonetheless. Immortals Fenyx Rising, as with all new IP, may have been a risky jump for Ubisoft, but it was a leap worth taking.",,,,,,,,,,,"Immortals Fenyx Rising is far from perfect--but it is good. It stumbles frequently as it explores Greek myths through a new lens, its best features are borrowed, and for as large and fun as its world is, it always feels like you're on a guided tour instead of really exploring it. But even as it lives in the shadow of better games, its puzzles, combat, and open-world loop come together often enough for me to not only see it through for a few dozen hours, but also want to keep filling out its almighty checklist, even if it lead me by the nose most of the way through.",,,,,,"Enthralling and addictive Open World-Adventure, which can set its own course despite obvious role models.",,"Immortals Fenyx Rising copies elements from Zelda: Breath of the Wild to your heart's content and combines them effortlessly with the trusted Ubisoft formula. This combination turns out surprisingly well due to the funny writing, the colorful world, and interesting puzzles.",,,,,,,,,,Immortals Fenyx Rising is by far one of the best surprises of 2020. It shot directly up to the top of my best games of the year.,"Its attempts at humor may flop, but Immortals succeeds at being a fun and engaging Breath of the Wild clone.",,,,,,,,,,,"Fun action, intelligent puzzles and a wonderful world to discover. Ubisoft Quebec has created one of the best action adventure titles of the year.",,,,,,,,"As an adaptation of the Assassin's Creed RPG style to a breezier, more open and more playful world, Immortals Fenyx Rising is a total success. It might come off second best to Breath of the Wild, and its chatty and light-hearted take on subject matter traditionally treated in games as dark and bloody might not be to everyone's taste, but the treatment of greek myth's gods and monsters here makes for a delightful experience in its own right.","While I did enjoy some of the puzzles, I wish they were more challenging and employed a greater variety of mechanisms. Personally, I’d rather spend time thinking about how to solve a puzzle rather than looking for the triggers that I know are needed to solve the puzzles. Overall, though, there’s plenty of gameplay here wrapped in a good story and imaginative environment to please most fans of open world action games. It’s hard not to have fun with a game that has so much fun with itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Still, Immortals Fenyx Rising is one of the best games of the year. It doesn’t matter if its inspiration is so blatant when the team uses that as only a springboard. This isn’t a repaint of Breath of the Wild, but rather an evolution of it, and more often than not it makes smarter gameplay decisions that in full create a more enjoyable, irresistible world. The disjointed, sometimes crass tone leaves a bad taste, especially among those looking to enjoy this with their kids or siblings, but as clear as the throughline is between Breath of the Wild and Immortals Fenyx Rising, it’s just as obvious that Immortals will live again. This is just the start of something special.","Immortals is more than just a fun open-world with slick combat and massive Breath of the Wild vibes, it's also a superbly written and legitimately funny take on Greek mythology. This is one of Ubisoft's best games in years.",,,"A consistently compelling progression curve, gorgeous world, and a staggering amount of fun content makes Immortals Fenyx Rising a truly fantastic game, even if it is rather derivative at times.",The blandness of the gameplay might have been somewhat forgivable if the game’s narrative didn’t suffer from an identity crisis.,,"This game isn’t a miss. Zelda this is not, but it’s plenty of fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ultimately if Ubisoft can work out the kinks that were to be expected from a first excursion, Immortals has real potential to become another marquee property for the company. Expected DLC will take players to Asia as a brand-new character, which could potentially be an inkling that Ubisoft plans on exploring many other mythologies yet. The biggest challenge that the company will face is finding a way to bring out a distinctive personality on the mechanical side of Immortals, because as it currently stands it most certainly feels like a case of “throwing everything at the dartboard to see what sticks,"" and Ubisoft is cribbing a lot from games that are already excellent.",,,,,,,,,,,
mlb-the-show-22,"My overall opinion is really just asking myself why I didn't play the MLB The Show franchise more throughout the years. I can only imagine what kind of difference has been made with each iteration. This year for sure has made me a new fan, and I plan to continue to check out the franchise as the years go on. I found I want to log in every day to see what new cards I was getting and to see if I could improve my skills more and more, and they have. I will definitely play this homerun more throughout the year.",,,"MLB The Show 22 is another brilliant arrival in the series, and once again delivers fluid and gorgeous presentation on Xbox Series X|S. The gameplay remains highly satisfying, while Road to the Show and Diamond Dynasty remain compulsive modes. While 'no money spent' is still pleasingly feasible in the latter, it feels a little more grind-heavy this year, so hopefully that will ease off. Elsewhere new commentary is welcome, but is too short on lines this time around.

Perfect gateway to baseball games for anyone who loves the sport and knows its rules, the Sony IE title will not make a regular in the saga jump out of his chair, and that's the only big downside: the lack of new game modes. For the rest, the modeling of the greatest bat and ball stars is impeccable, the lifespan striking with a gameplay always accessible to newcomers. But be careful, you still have to know the sport.","MLB The Show 22 is a fantastic sports simulation title. However, it doesn't reinvent the wheel and fans of the series may have hoped for more evolution.

wrc-10-the-official-game,"WRC 10 is absolutely amazing! The biggest downside is the learning curve, but the effort is well worth it when you take the time to master its handling. You can choose your tires and their position to suit the track and or your driving style and well as choose between auto and custom settings of the braking, suspension and other fine tuning. The amount of customization that is available for the player makes WRC 10 easy to get into regardless of your skill. Now we just need the ability to use a steering wheel instead of a controller and this would be an even better simulator.","Overall and if you can look past that glaring miss of possible greed, WRC 10 is a fantastic game. The cars feel the part, handling is much more in-depth this year than in previous entries, and should you have the capacity to race with a wheel then you’ll find the whole experience incredibly engaging. Even with a controller though there is certainly plenty to be excited by and whilst we only have a few years left of Kylotonn holding the WRC license, we are surely seeing the best we’ve ever seen from the franchise yet.",,,"Dodgy menu system and an online community which is lacking numbers aside, should you be after a deep, highly detailed rally racer, WRC 10 is going to cover everything you want and need… and then some.",,WRC 10 manages to rise definitively as the most complete rally title of the moment.,,,,,,,"WRC 10 is postulated as one of the most complete iteration of the saga, with an extensive proposal for a single player with a wide career mode and a fun range of multiplayer mode.

Anniversary Mode galvanizes content and lifespan via new, delightfully old-school layouts, to make the title the most complete in the license. We take real pleasure in terms of racing sensations and a total change of scenery on some specials, despite the recurring lack of staging and some technical flaws (tearing, cliping ...). But that is not the important thing: WRC 10 ends a decade at the top of the slope masterfully climbed by Kylotonn in recent seasons, and we hope that the French studio will succeed in closing its commitment to the world rally championship in the best possible way next season.",,Quotation forthcoming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While not a monumental upgrade over past installments, WRC 10 makes some welcome changes to the formula that continue to make it a must-play for fans of the sport.",,,,"WRC 10 is a great rally game and a lovely, if a fraction flawed, ode to the… 49-year history of the World Rally Championship.

alan-wake-remastered,,"This title is a true example of a game being considered art. The use of loops, light vs darkness themes, the music and score, all whilst building a lovable cast of characters makes it a memorable game. I would consider this remaster a general success with the exception for PC, consoles seem to be running the game with only one serious known issue that should be fixed soon.","Alan Wake Remastered does what a good remaster should. It honors the original game’s artistic direction while enhancing it with modern technology, specifically in the form of volumetric lighting. Its lack of American Nightmare as part of the package is disappointing to say the least, but fans of Remedy’s current work would do well to take a trip to Bright Falls, whether they’re returning or visiting for the first time.","If you've never played Alan Wake, this is the best possible way to experience the game. For anyone who loves horror or Remedy's other titles, there's a ton to unpack here with an engaging narrative and stellar gameplay. The remastered enhancements bolster the game even further, giving it a place in today's gaming world, and while the gameplay doesn't perhaps hold up as well as it did in 2010, Alan Wake Remastered is still as joyous as it was back then and a perfect treat for the Halloween season.",,,,,,Alan Wake Remastered compiles a polished compilation of the original game and its DLC.

While the ongoing trend of remasters and remakes may slowly be becoming tiring or seem uninspired to some, there exists a handful of games in recent years that have reaped the benefits of getting a second chance to strike gold. As a new player coming into the series, I was incredibly excited for this remaster and I came away from the experience with my expectations met and surprisingly exceeded. To see a much-discussed game in the best possible light, means the things that matter to what made the game special back in 2010 remain so today.

Beside that, Alan Wake remains a great mixture of horror story and action with tactical light use and a huge dose of kaboom.

If you are a fan of the original, the remastered version is a great opportunity to revisit Bright Falls.",,,,,,Writer Alan Wake searches for his missing wife while tackling a malevolent force disguised as darkness in this clunky but atmospheric reboot.,"Alan Wake remastered is something I have always wanted to exist as the original was highly under looked when it came out. It was tied to one console and frankly Remedy was not quite the household name it is today. It is one of their best games and worth checking out whether you played the original or not. It still carries plenty of jank and questionable design mechanics from that era, but the story and characters excel it past most of its own issues. This is one experience that is worth revisiting or experiencing for the first time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alan Wake Remastered mostly improves on an already excellent horror shooter experience, introducing a genre icon to a brand new audience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alan Wake Remastered is the definitive version of Alan's story in Bright Falls. It is the exact same game that acquired quiet respect amongst fans and critics following its 2010 release. Only now it boasts 4K visuals and 60FPS gameplay. Along with some welcome bonus features, and packaged-in DLC, the remaster is a must for superfans, and a fantastic starting point for curious newcomers, with only a few small annoyances that stop it just short of reaching perfection.",,,,,,,,,,
the-artful-escape,,,,"It's also worth mentioning there are some substantial performance issues. The frame rate dropped considerably fairly often, pulling us out of its gorgeous world. There were also a few occasions where dialogue on the screen was not voiced, which felt very odd. However, these issues aside, The Artful Escape is absolutely an adventure worth taking. It contains some magical moments, an engaging narrative and the best soundtrack in a game all year. It doesn't always hit the mark, but when it does, it smashes it out of the park.","The Artful Escape is well worth the wait. An exciting, well-acted feast for the senses, it does not disappoint. There are a couple of technical issues that need to be sorted, but on the whole, games this imaginative and enthralling don't come along very often.",,The Artful Escape (previously known as The Artful Escape of Francis Vendetti) is an upcoming platform video game being developed by Beethoven & Dinosaur.,,"The Artful Escape is an enigmatic coming of age story, wrapped in reverb-laden riffs and space opera shenanigans. It is quite unique, and absolutely unmissable.",,,,,"The Artful Escape is a game with a brave narrative, an original and unique artistic view, and excellent choice of voice casting and soundtrack. Even with some flaws, it's a must-have game.","A cosmic rock voyage of self-discovery that doesn't folk about, The Artful Escape is a truly unique experience and a feast for the senses. Those looking for a challenge or who are deathly allergic to guitars will probably want to look elsewhere for their next game. But given what an unusual and aesthetically captivating experience it is — and the fact that it's right there on Game Pass — it couldn't be easier for me to recommend. It'll likely prove a little too strange for some people's tastes, but if you don't enjoy it, it's still a quick (and hopefully at least interesting) 1,000G boost in five hours or so from a game you likely won't remember playing this time next year. But if you do end up enjoying it, and I think a lot of folks will, there's a very real chance it could end up being five hours you'll never forget.",,,"Highly contemplative, utterly eccentric and absolutely magnificent, The Artful Escape offers a visual and sound experience that is as puzzling as it is thrilling. But the beauty of the abstract can reach its limits when the nonsense ends up losing us. And the journey sometimes runs out of steam when the gameplay remains on its way. However, the journey remains relatively captivating up and down, both for its beauty and its uniqueness. But there is no doubt that it will be divisive.",,"The Artful Escape is a beautiful and imaginative trip along the life and aspirations of a young guitarist. Close your eyes for a moment and relax, it will be a special one.",,,,,"The Artful Escape is an unforgettable psychedelic journey. Its short length helps its simple mechanics stay fresh so you can focus on Francis’ journey and its stunning visuals. Perhaps fully embracing the medium could have made this something even more special, but it’s an experience all its own, and that’s okay. Much like the game tries to teach Francis, sometimes you can just have to be what you are.",,,,"The Artful Escape may not have particularly deep or challenging gameplay, but the main reason to attend this show is its incredible writing and Francis’ trippy, out-of-this-world journey in discovering his new persona, one which features a lot of nifty twists in various ways, alongside truly striking sci-fi visuals and an expertly-crafted soundtrack. The Artful Escape is an astonishing rock and roll epic that the likes of Ziggy Stardust would be proud of.",,,"The Artful Escape is by turns psychedelic, moving, exultant, and lovely. The central metaphor of a young performer bringing fantastic new worlds into existence through the art of music is a powerful one, and while the theme of a struggling musician finding his authentic voice while paying homage to the past might not be a new one, it’s certainly new to videogames. The Artful Escape only missteps when it tries too hard to be a game, ironic given the story’s premise of search for authenticity. Aside from that, The Artful Escape is a surprising and joyous exploration of the power of collaboration, the struggle for identity, and the mind-blowing, life-altering sound of the very loud galactic symphony.",,,,"The Artful Escape is a great visual-novel and a rock and roll dream. It is one of the best looking games I’ve played with an equally interesting narrative. However, the severe lack of interactiveness really drags down the game.",,"The Artful Escape feels like a novel written by a musician, and takes the music and electric guitar fans to a beautiful but not so perfect journey.","Though it's a relatively short and easy game, The Artful Escape is also a charming, witty spectacle from start to finish in its six or so hours of playtime. I loved Francis' story and the far-away lands he visits on his quest to believe in himself and write his own future. I can foresee some players scoffing at the entire project for its particular brand of humor, but expect it will be adored by drama kids, garage rockers, and general outcasts all over. The Artful Escape plays like a psychedelic jam band session and tells a story like someone spiked Wes Anderson's Darjeeling tea.",,,,"This one’s a no-brainer; The Artful Escape is on Xbox Game Pass and you absolutely, positively have no reason to miss it if you’re a subscriber. If you’re not and you enjoy warm fuzzies, either get on board or buy it outright as you won’t be disappointed.",,"The Artful Escape certainly won’t tick all the boxes for everyone that comes through. It’s an abstract title that isn’t afraid to go against the grain in every capacity. From the visuals down to the actual mechanics, it’s unlike anything else on the market. But for that exact reason, it’s absolutely an experience worth your time. Creativity to this degree is rare in the modern gaming industry and therefore, The Artful Escape shouldn’t go amiss.","Annapurna Interactive has a staggering back catalogue, but 2021 has frankly not been great for the publisher. Last Stop failed to leave any kind of impact, Maquette is a game with Bryce Dallas Howard in it and not much else, and Twelve Minutes, despite being loaded with star-power, wastes its time loop mechanic in service of a ridiculous twist ending that derails the entire game. With The Artful Escape, plus Neon White, Stray, and Solar Ash to come in the near future, it feels like Annapurna is back.",,,,,"The Artful Escape is a bold and beautiful trip through the cosmos, featuring a killer soundtrack and a thrilling space adventure.",,,,,,,"A must for Xbox Game Pass subscribers, and absolutely recommended for everyone else, The Artful Escape of Francis Vendetti tells with irony and intelligence the path of artistic and inner growth of a talented teenage musician. Through the celestial bodies of the Stupefacosm, the protagonist and the player learn together to follow only the rhythm of their electric guitar, among extraordinarily inspired landscapes. Even in the face of a playful sector that does not represent the fulcrum of the work, the only regret remains a rhythm game soul that could have dared more. But in the face of the power of the proposed experience, we consider it a slight observation that we hope will be heard in a desirable second journey into the Stupefacosm.","The Artful Escape is a hard to define game. Light platform and rhythm’n’game elements are diluted inside a narrative driven gameplay that tasks the player with life and artistic choices. While the gameplay is bent to the main thematic of the game, visual and music take the mind of the player through an epic, psychedelic journey in a rock, sci-fi, over the top space opera.","Like its protagonist, The Artful Escape leans into its unique identity and comes out the better for it. The game is breathtakingly beautiful, rich in music, and makes you feel like an intergalactic rock star while examining some thoughtful, relatable fears.",,,"The Artful Escape, aided by its ultra-accessible mechanics, is more of a visual journey. As an escape into Francis’ preoccupation, it does make sense for there to be no real challenge. He’s intentionally a Gary Stu in the story he’s weaving for himself and, because of the simplicity, The Artful Escape disarms the player with incomparable visuals, a terrific soundtrack, and a focus on themes like public image and the overlap of fantasy and reality. It’s not interactively demanding and variety is scarce, but at around four hours, it’s an afternoon well spent to vitalise the body and soul.",,,"The Artful Escape is a wonderful audiovisual experience with a lot of great moments and a intense story. If you like this types of games, you should try it.",,,"For players who find themselves similarly unsure of their own identities, it could well resonate long after the amps and stage lights have been switched off. [Issue#364, p.116]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Artful Escape is a wonderful four-hour musical performance with some epic guitar solos and an incredible visuals.,,"This is a moving postcard to the 70s and 80s as far as influence goes -- as if David Bowie, Pink Floyd and Genesis found each other on a moving platform designed by Terry Gilliam rapidly coasting through the far reaches of space, powered entirely by solar sails and positive thought, and decided to jam.",,,,,,,"A tour de force of light and sound, The Artful Escape is unlike anything else you’ve played. With no easy genre label to stick on the game, the only way you’ll know if you’re going to enjoy it is to try it. It’s a trip alright, one that will have your foot tapping and your head rocking from start to finish.",,,,,,,,,,,"The Artful Escape is a joyous intergalactic trip with an electric guitar and vibrant visuals. Like a good solo, if you get swept up in the experience, you'll forget all about its flaws.",,"When Francis played his final set and the credits started rolling, I was quite glad to have played The Artful Escape. It is very clearly Its Own Thing, and not only is that thing pretty awesome, it’s just one more example that videogames are able to deliver a huge array of experiences that are all worthwhile in their own way. I love that Beethoven & Dinosaur brought their vision to my screen, and if nothing else, maybe this rock-fueled journey through the stars will get developers off of movies and on to music videos for a while.",,"The Artful Escape is beautiful, sad, compelling and mind-blowing in equal measure. It’s more of a concept album than it is a game and that’s fine, because with so many set-pieces, such well-realised vignettes, and such awe-inspiring talent behind it, you’re more than happy to sit down and take in the journey as your fingers dance on the pad from time to time to keep the game moving forward. You’ve heard of prog rock music before, but this might be the first prog-rock game.",,"The lack of challenge in The Artful Escape, not just in its play but in its emotional texture, somewhat shreds the odyssey.","The Artful Escape is, Galvatron has said, a 17-year-old’s conception of what it is to play in a rock band: musical transcendence meets universal adoration beneath the hot lights. But behind the shimmer, this is a touching tale of how to break free of the creative expectations of others. There is little traditional challenge here, but as a left-field power fantasy, few video games are so immediately stylish or so gratifying.",,,,,,"Ultimately you're watching a performance as much as giving one, and for a game this sly and playful, I can live with that. This is a rush, a conceit, a virtuoso doodle. It's a gas. It's a lark. [Eurogamer Recommended]","The Artful Escape began as a fantasy of what a teenage Johnny Galvatron thought the rockstar life could look like. Instead, it serves as a psychedelic reminder. Francis needs some help from flying turtles and transdimensional brainstems, but eventually he gains freedom from his Bob Dylan-esque uncle through his own intergalactic persona. And while we can’t all just step into the cosmos to escape our troubles, one way or another, we all need to be ourselves someday, free of shadow.",,,,,"The idea behind The Artful Escape is great, the art style is breathtaking, while the story about coming of age, teenage insecurities and meeting expectations is told brilliantly. Unfortunately, all that doesn’t count for much when a music game has an awful score, guitar shredding quickly becomes boring and the whole thing is basic to a fault.

nba-2k23,"There is just so much to talk about, and really more worth experiencing than just reading about. Upgraded graphics with really impressive hair and skin, the ability to download the app to scan your face and put yourself into the game, and even the real contest, there's simply a massive amount of things to do. Make sure you also check out the shoe creator, which lets you design your own kicks and for your created player, give power-ups to give you that on-court advantage you have always wanted, and I absolutely love it. Definitely give NBA 2K23 a chance. Yes, the controls can be hard to learn but if you practice and work at it and do the drills, just like in real-life ball, you too can show you have what it takes to make it in the NBA.","If you ask me, if you’re not willing to play MyCareer or even MyTeam, then save your money as NBA 2K23 is not worth it in the long run. You’ll just end up spending more money than you initially thought you would while potentially playing anything but basketball.",,"NBA 2K23 is the strongest this franchise has looked and felt in recent memory. With a fantastic focus on various eras from the past 50 years of the sport, a superb Michael Jordan Challenge mode, plenty of improvements on the court and series-best presentation, this is a super slick and polished feast of basketball for fans to dig into. Yes, microtransactions are still an ugly issue, especially in MyPlayer mode, but if you can look past this failing, you're in for an absolute treat here with a ton of deep and addictive single player and online modes to get stuck into.","In a nutshell, this is one of the most complete sports games on the market and you will not be disappointed with NBA 2K23. Simply put, it’s the best basketball videogame of all time.",,The newest entry of the NBA2K family pays homage to the embodiment of basketball itself: Michael Jordan and it does it flawlessly with very tiny details to polish.,,,"NBA 2K23 is a step up for the NBA 2K series as far as gameplay and in-game elements go, and the new additions to modes like MyNBA and MyTeam help the game modes feel less stale as a whole. However, the game's incredibly heavy reliance on microtransactions continues to hold back what is otherwise an incredible sports game.",,,"NBA 2K23 has once again hit the jackpot. The very rich offering in terms of modes, a more refined gameplay, an increasingly realistic AI and a top-notch graphical appearance make it an unmissable title, despite some minor imperfections.","NBA 2K23 is a more than remarkable installment of the famous basketball saga, where the eras of My NBA mode and Jordan Challenge stand out, taking us back to epic moments of the past with a presentation and design adapted to each era. Even so, the abusive use of microtransactions and its dependence on the My Career mode continue to be major negative points.",,,"When you buy NBA 2K, you know what you're getting. Except this year, NBA 2K23 sees Visual Concepts bringing its 'A' game, with an excellent MyCareer mode, the return of Jordan Challenges, and an addictive MyTeam offering. This is a straight-up slam dunk.","Undoubtedly the best opus of the license released to date. In addition to the already gargantuan lifespan, further improved in solo and multiplayer thanks to a My NBA mode boosted by the choice of 4 eras, the return of the Jordan Challenge, the co-op mode in My Team and the Career Theater, the gameplay in will delight some. The former crazy dribblers are now limited online and must think collectively, the shooting timing is more demanding, but much fairer and a lot of new animations come to shake up the regulars. Graphically impeccable, taking in immersion with old-school skins for period matches, the title enters the Hall of Fame. Only gray areas, the usual desire (or even need) to take out the credit card to get more VC and advance your player, a matchmaking that is still quite unbalanced and some crashes on certain career quests. Even MJ can have flaws.",,,"The gameplay is the best it has ever been, and the live service is the most predatory feeling, but there is enough other content on offer that I’d still recommend this year’s title. It’s stunning to look at, thanks in part to its jaw-droppingly large install size, features tons of classic teams, and far better WNBA integration. If you haven’t played an NBA 2K game in a while this might finally be the year for you to jump back in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No sports game gets the past right quite like NBA 2K23 – and its present-day immersiveness is incredibly powerful, too.","I am heavily conflicted about NBA 2K23. On one hand, the new retro game modes have reached out to my inner sports geek and given me a way to replay NBA history in a way that I’ve never done before. Especially paired with a handful of really strong gameplay changes, like improved spacing and AI, I foresee myself dumping dozens of hours into reliving and reconstructing NBA history. Conversely, I now feel completely and utterly isolated from the MyCareer experience. I have no interest in shelling out additional cash (even beyond the expensive Michael Jordan Edition) or grind for insane hours just to be able to compete on the online court, and the density of The City and its shopping opportunities is lost on me for the same reason. Instead, I’ll take my metaphorical basketball and go home, where I can enjoy the parts of NBA 2K23 that I can fully experience without the repugnant emphasis of its microtransactions.","After last year's disappointing entry, NBA 2K23 is certainly a step in the right direction. The basketball is as good as it has ever been and the Jordan Challenge is truly wonderful, you just have to ignore a bit of jank to find the fun.",,,,,,,,,"NBA 2K23 best honors the number it carries. The playful offer of the new basketball iteration by 2K and Visual Concepts is sumptuous, both in terms of visual presentation and content offer. Alongside the now classic game modes such as My Career and My Team, we find the experience in the expanded and enriched WNBA, a Mia NBA mode even more layered and structured than in the past, with several new features (such as the Age of Basketball) that fans of the wedge ball will love. The highlight, however, is the return of the Jordan Challenge, which could be worth the price of the ticket alone. With NBA 2K23 the development team confirms the very high simulation level that is now the trademark of the franchise, this year further refined and studied in detail.",,,,NBA 2K23 is both a great sport game and a terrible open world. Forget the City and enjoy the NBA of the past: it's here where the greatest players and the best contents of the game are.,"Refinements to core aspects of NBA 2K23’s gameplay make for some of the most fluid and enjoyable action seen in some years, and it’s all capped off with the excellent Jordan Challenge. It’s not perfect by any means, but this year’s NBA 2K is certainly a big step up from previous entries.",,,"Despite its heavy focus on microtransactions, NBA 2K23 is the basketball game that sports fans have been waiting for for quite some time.",,,,,,,,,,,,"There's no denying it: NBA 2K23 is once again a sports game of the highest level, and I thoroughly enjoyed the Jordan Challenge and the retro options. However, it's getting harder and harder to perceive the visual and gameplay improvements, along with the most aggressive micropayment system in the entire industry.",,,,,,,,,,"Simpler and more arcade-like, and therefore more accessible, NBA 2K23 is also a nostalgic love letter to NBA history. My Career mode remains so good that if it weren't plagued by micro transactions or trips to ""The City"", it would simply be perfect.",,,,,,"These issues, especially due to their persistence year after year, do hinder NBA 2K23 from being historically great, but for annual players who have gotten used to these problems, they'll likely sting less. What remains after you forgive (or just try to forget) those issues is undoubtedly still an exceptional basketball game made with an intense attention to detail and a love of the game. On the court, NBA 2K23 looks and feels lifelike and exciting in every drive, and the new and revamped modes treat the NBA like a revered historical monument. In those important ways it does its best to reflect Jordan's greatness and shows both NBA newcomers and historians what it's like to play like Mike.",,,,,"NBA 2K23 is bogged down in a lot of problems courtesy of predatory monetization and an overzealous RPG game taking priority over the actual basketball-ing, but it does have great qualities as well. There is plenty of content ensuring there's something for everyone to play and the game leans into its simulation aspects in a risky, but effective way. If the series can hone these good qualities and leave behind its outdated monetization schemes, 2K could garner another level of respect and become something that rises above the other sports games.",,,,,"NBA 2K23 represents one of the biggest steps forward for the franchise in recent years. The abundance of modes will keep players entertained throughout the NBA season, and the on-court gameplay continues to be improved. It's just a shame that microtransactions continue to be as woven within the fabric of the game as they are.",,"In the end, NBA 2K23 isn’t a perfect game. But it is the strongest, deepest, smoothest, and most enjoyable showing for the series in some time. With a little less focus on microtransactions, and a little more focus on ramping up other modes, perfection is definitely within reach in the coming years.",,,,"Home to some of the most immersive experiences, detailed graphics, and engaging features in the sports game industry, NBA 2K23 has set the bar of excellence for what a world class sports game is truly made of. Though its clear-cut inconsistencies across the next and current generation editions diminishes its overall potential, NBA 2K23 has still risen to the top as one of the best sports games of the year.",,"NBA 2K23 is a fantastic package that is marred by a heavy reliance on microtransactions. Unless a player is going to spend hours and hours grinding out The City, the only way to find a modicum of success is to open your wallet and buy the virtual currency to boost your players and teams.",,,,,,,"There is no question that NBA 2K23 is the most inspired work in the series, or any other in all of sports video gaming.

It will take you on a journey through a strange abandoned land that is beautiful, accompanied by a brilliant soundtrack and new surprises along the way.",,"Far: Changing Tides follows the same idea of Far: Lone Sails, an adventure that will grip you from the first moment, whose art will blow you away and that. Unfortunately.

Filled with wonder, challenge and discovery, this is a game that rewards attention while keeping the gameplay fun and peaceful. If you are a fan of indie games that try and push the bar on what is possible, you owe yourself a service to give FAR: Changing Tides a shot.",,"At the end of a trip it is normal to wonder if it was worth it or not. The answer is yes, with a more than adequate duration so that it doesn't become repetitive, an entertaining game dynamic and the whole sea world to think about yourself, FAR: Changing Tides is an easily recommended adventure for any type of player.",,,"Mysterious, beautiful, and almost dreamlike, FAR: Changing Tides betters its predecessor, delivering a truly memorable and engaging seafaring journey.","More meditative than contemplative, FAR: Changing Tides is an invitation to tranquility, so assertive that it sometimes becomes sluggish. Between the long crossings, moments of grace maintain the interest of the experience, translated by intuitive puzzles and sound design at its peak.","Despite its shortcomings, FAR: Changing Tides is stunning and is an atmospheric triumph. I loved the developer’s vision for a doomed future, and the array of environments you explore.",,"Game length is about right and although there is very little narrative, the story does come full circle and has a satisfying conclusion. If you are looking for a chilled-out, unusual puzzle-solving game I heartily recommend this one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"FAR: Changing Tides’ gameplay loop of keeping your ramshackle vehicle running is simple but enjoyable. When you get into a good rhythm, you feel at one with your craft, everything goes smoothly for a minute, and you can enjoy the ride until the next mast snaps or abandoned wreckage blocks your way. It takes patience, but when every quick task is rewarded by a hum, whir, or click, and every obstacle inspires as much awe as it does terror, it’s all worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Excluding a technical side to be fixed and compositions that are never impacting and memorable, FAR: Changing Tides is an exciting and fun previous adventure game with intelligent and well-structured gameplay, representing an evolution of the chapter of the franchise in all its its playful components. In FAR: Changing Tides the story is full of significant moments for the character as well as for the player, and I prefer not to name some of them so as not to spoil the surprise for anyone interested in buying the game, coming soon on GamePass. The story, although silent and not very rich in information, is nevertheless pleasant, with serious themes within it that manage to capture different social nuances. A videogame of this kind represents a panacea for anyone who is trying to disconnect their mind and wants to experience a journey that is not only educational, but also personal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sometimes between big and bombastic games like Horizon Forbiden West and Elden Ring you just want to experience something with a smaller scale, and Far: Changing Tides is a perfect game for this exact purpose.

What's perhaps more surprising is that 2K has added two substantial modes (in the new WNBA career mode The W and the massively multiplayer The City) to make it the most feature-packed one ever too. Much of its content still has the weight of microtransactions hanging over it, but as long as you don't mind ignoring that and putting in the grind instead, this is a great purchase for NBA fans: especially if you held fire and haven't played 2K21 on Xbox One yet.","NBA 2K21 Next Generation on Xbox Series X is a great addition to an already packed amount of content. It’s visually more stunning than anything that has come before it, with a complete sheen to the gameplay and stunning work in how the players move and react. Everything is just topped off by some amazing work in the audio department.","NBA 2K21 sure has that ""next-gen feel"", but that's as far as it gets. There are updated, certainly not revolutionary, visuals, and some serious new content that puts last-gen versions -and it's pricing - to shame, but the first next-gen NBA 2K feels like a fastbreak that results in a casual layup, not a dunk.",,"NBA 2K21 feels like a new game on the new consoles.

It still shares the micro transaction greediness with the previous generation, but that aside, it keeps to deliver an excellent basketball game.","NBA 2K21 on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S is a big step forward for the franchise and easily the best version of this year’s basketball franchise. There might be the feeling that features were shorn from the current gen release to give it more impact, but from the inclusivity of featuring the WNBA in MyPlayer, to the sprawling The City online hub and the stunning graphics and gameplay improvements, this will keep you and your new console happy well into 2022.",,,,"NBA 2K21 Next Generation takes full advantage of next-gen hardware, improving graphics and physics but also adding more content and welcome new modes; playing at 4K 60fps with great graphics and truly alive arenas is a real joy.

This is the most impressive sports game launch on a next-gen console in years, and more than worth the price of admission.",,,,,,,,,,,"The edition for the new generation of consoles is much better than the old one, especially when it comes to graphics (spectacular!) and loading times (lightning fast).

It’s not just about enhanced visuals. There is more under the hood in almost every area. This isn’t a perfect game. There is room for improvement in multiple areas, but what it does excellently far outshines the smaller, and much-easier to absorb shortcomings. 2K has again set the standard on a new console, and everyone else is playing catch-up. The fact that this game was developed during a pandemic is inspiring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s an overall terrific revamp for NBA 2K21, and a game that has something for everyone, especially when you consider that MyTeam and MyCareer also have plenty of other fun to offer.

diablo-ii-resurrected,,,,,"Time spent with Diablo II: Resurrected is certainly an enjoyable one. It isn’t as polished as Diablo III, but then this is a remaster of a 21 year old game and I fear the devs were pretty much painted into a corner: if they changed the systems, the original fans would be up in arms, but keeping the original feel does mean it slightly alienates players who are used to the newer game.",,Diablo 2: Resurrected achieves the perfect mix between nostalgia and updating the game. Its main flaw is that it may be a game focused on fans and not so open to new players.,,,,,,"Diablo II: Resurrected makes us forget the 20 years passed since the release of the original game, delivering the same incredible experience but with graphics capable of leaving us speechless. A pure, challenging and satisfying action-RPG, capable of providing endless satisfaction and countless hours of play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A Remaster to the letter, Diablo 2 Resurrected introduces a new graphic layer on top of the original Diablo game, which is still available at the touch of a button. The inclusion of the Legacy mode shows both the progression in graphics and the truthfulness to the original in gameplay. While there are some quality-of-life improvements, we would have preferred quite a few more. Resurrected is especially suited for the hardcore fans of the original, provided they can wait for online to be included.",,,,"Diablo 2 Resurrected is the embodiment of a balancing act: how can one preserve the original vision of a 20-year-old title, while adapting it to an audience that has since seen a sequel, and all this on a controller? This is the daring challenge that Blizzard and its teams set themselves, and where many expected an industrial accident, the result, even if imperfect, still makes us smile. We can only advise you to think carefully about the choice of your version if you have the possibility to play on PC. However, it must be said that the experience on a console remains quite pleasant. A classic among classics and a sure value for hack’n slash fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Diablo 2: Resurrected is a faithful, meticulous remaster that shows just how well the original has aged.",,,,,,,"If you've never played the original, then this is a great entry point. It's hard to hide its age even under the layer of polish, but Diablo 2: Resurrected is still a damn fine game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Diablo II Resurrected is the best version of the game yet, and a classic reborn for the new generations. Maybe something more could have been done for the quality of life and extra features, but this is still a seminal game for the action rpg genre.",,,,"Despite being over 20 years old, Diablo II is a true classic and offers gameplay that holds up very well even today. However, the graphics do not, which makes it fitting that this remaster lovingly repaints the exterior but leaves most of the interior intact. Some parts would have benefited from some modernization however, and the unstable yet more or less mandatory online service can lead to great frustration and in some cases even loss of progress. An unnecessary fault in an otherwise superb remaster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Diablo 2 Resurrected is a masterpiece in its own right; it evokes a freshness all the while hitting players with an overwhelming sense of nostalgia. The sheer joy that is had when delving into dungeons to destroy the Lord of Terror and by extension is brothers (the expansion Lord of Destruction is included in this release with all of the classes/items and fixes that it brought back in the day.

Boasting great network play and a solid amount of offline content with more story mode updates and a season pass of new characters on the way. I love the art direction and the characters, who are voiced by some awesome talent and have bits and pieces of personality from the show it took inspiration from, but still having enough to differentiate themselves by game mechanics and aesthetics. Oh, and I love the music—just the right amount of synth and instrumentation that match their stages really well.",,"Them’s Fightin’ Herds delivers a unique and varied cast of characters that promise a high-caliber fighting game experience. If all you are looking for is that, I cannot find any reason not to recommend this game.

The issue is that even two years after initially releasing on PC, it still doesn’t feel like a completed game, nor have the developers been clear about when that will change.

lost-judgment,,"Lost Judgement is in my eyes a superb addition to the Yakuza series and is jam-packed with content. The graphics are great, the voice acting is great and the amount of activities that will distract you from the main quest is mind-blowing. It used the same formula which made its predecessors so much fun to play and improved on it. Even as dark and gruesome as the main story is there is always something around the corner in this game to put a smile back on your face.",,"Yakuza games have been arriving thick and fast over the years, but Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio still hasn't lost its touch. It's hard to think of another series with such regular entries that manages to constantly evolve at this level. While most don't add too much to alter the formula, Lost Judgment throws just about everything it can into its world without feeling over-saturated. With the main story, side quests, school stories, mini-games, exploration and other distractions, it's hard not to be impressed with what's on display. There's still an element of hold handing in the detective sections we'd love to see worked on and the lip-syncing may not be the best, but the team's first attempt at delivering a simultaneous worldwide release for the series is a gamble that has paid off and perhaps offers the best entry in the franchise so far.","Lost Judgment on Xbox feels like a misstep in comparison to the plot of its predecessor, but it still stands head and shoulders above most other open-world titles.",,Lost Judgment is a phenomenal improvement over its prequel and becomes a must-have for all Yakuza series fans out there.,,"While I really enjoyed Lost Judgment, the mishandling of some of the core, and incredibly sensitive themes really did reduce the experience. I still think it's a good game, but my feelings about it have definitely diminished since the opening hours, which I'm rather disappointed about. Still, if you like the Yakuza series and its spin-off games in general, you'll probably love this.","Lost Judgment is a great mystery game with the signature Yakuza flair. If you're a fan, or even if you're not, you'll have a fun time with this game despite its dark subject matter.",,,"Lost Judgment is a huge game with a storyline that will keep you glued to the screen and seasoned with a fast, frantic and spectacular gameplay and some very enjoyable mini-games. Recommended both to those who were already fans of the series and to those looking for a game with a strong narrative impact but without sacrificing fun gameplay.","Lost Judgment is a perfect sequel that improves and expands on everything the first part had. Next-gen graphics, along with flawless performance, act as the pillars of a thrilling story that dares everything, as well as fast-paced and fun gameplay.",,,"If you need additional proof that developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is a master of its craft, then look no further.

And when all is said and done, you can sit and celebrate with some sushi.",,"Despite its intriguing whodunnit premise, Lost Judgment’s main story fails to sustain its suspense all the way to the finish and its detective methods remain only slightly less superficial than those of the previous game. However, its meaty undercover side stories set in and around the Seiryo High School kept me playing for hours and hours well after the main story credits had rolled, in doing so revealing a lot of fun surprises that I might never have found had the classroom cases not kept me on the hook. This Yakuza spin-off feels far from being considered case closed, but here’s hoping that Sega can show some better Judgment in the series' future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If nothing else, Lost Judgment proves it would be a great shame if he didn't get another opportunity to find his niche. [Issue#365, p.112]",,,,,,,,"Lost Judgment is more of the same, which isn't a particularly bad thing.

Even so, it’s still a fun experience, especially for fans of the first game.",,,,,,,,,,"While I still have much more to go before a final verdict, it's already clear that Lost Judgment is a deserved nominee for Game of the Year. Its unbelievable visual quality, superb characters and daring subject matter all come together in one exquisite, moving, unique experience. If you only play one open-world game on Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 this year, this is the one for you. [Provisional Score = 90]",,,,,,"For those who have played and enjoyed Judgment, the decision to pick up Lost Judgment should be a no-brainer. With a brand new story that's just as engaging (if not more so) than the first, as well as many gameplay improvements and a bucketload of new content, it's a fine example of a sequel done right. It's like a lucky dip where every time you load it up to play you're never sure what you're in for – but you'll rarely, if ever, be disappointed. Variety is the spice of life, they say, and Lost Judgment might just be the spiciest game I've played this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Lost Judgment is a good sequel to an amazing predecessor. The fighting system is fun, the mission design is very diverse, and you can still put hours into entertaining optional stuff within the vast open world. There is just one thing that makes a huge difference. Takayuki Yagami's new case is not in the least as personal and captivating as his first one. That doesn't make Lost Judgment a bad game, but it makes it clearly stand behind the first part of the spin-off series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lost Judgment is a bittersweet event. The story aims for a mature tone but is too often a macabre, morbid misfire that strays too far from the balance between silly and serious that the series is famed for. It's not a poorly developed title, though; the outrageously brilliant combat and sandbox distractions are clear evidence of that. It just struggles to tell the sort of meaningful, believable and sensitively weighted story that players have come to expect from this talented team.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An enthralling murder mystery with mature themes makes Lost Judgment one of the best narratives in the series. Yagami and his cohort are in their element as detectives and lawyers doggedly pursuing justice and truth, so much so that its relatively easy to overlook some of the tonal dissonance with the side content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The King of Fighters XV has a massive roster of 39 characters in the core game before any DLC, and with a healthy amount of mechanics to learn and master, it will take some patience, time and dedication to find your ideal trio to prove that you’re the true King of Fighters.","KING OF FIGHTERS XV may not be the best game when it comes to the story but the fighting aspect fills those missing holes. Being able to feel this excited about a fighting game almost feels unreal in a way. With my little experience with the genre, KING OF FIGHTERS XV makes me want to improve in every way that I can. The fluidity of the combat, the strategic big brain plays, the beautiful and handsome character designs, it all comes together and shatters all my expectations I had going into KING OF FIGHTERS XV and I look forward to putting more countless hours into the game.",,,"The action on offer in The King of Fighters XV is fast, furious, nicely polished and very addictive indeed. Finding a team that suits your playstyle is good fun, building your own team is rewarding, and with a deep and quite accessible fighting system to get to grips with, it’s well worth playing.",,"The King of Fighters saga is back, without many improvements but with the same sheer frantic action and charm that made it one of the best in the genre.",,,,,,,"The King of Fighters XV improves on the gameplay aspects of its predecessor, offering a very enjoyable experience for fans of the genre. The use of rollback netcode is great news for the online aspect, which will now be more stable than ever.",,,"Lacking in some departments it might be, but KOF XV is nonetheless a superlative fighting game, which only makes it all the more upsetting that it's missing features that have been a series staple for ages. Should you not care about such things, then SNK's latest King of Fighters outing will undoubtedly scratch any face-pounding itch, its various systems proving deep yet intuitive, resulting in bouts that are almost invariably close-fought and thrilling.","Excellence in gameplay, quality online mode, smooth execution... all the ingredients are there in this new generation fighting game! Fans of the latest installment should be thrilled, but we can't help but have some reservations about the art direction, content, and lack of life and inspiration in the sets. The King of Fighters has always been a franchise with a certain vibe, and it's perhaps a bit too generic to open up to the masses.","This long-running franchise has seen some excellent additions over the years. Therefore, it may be foolhardy to say that this is one of the best. Other than its obvious shortcomings, this is a brilliant game that enhances the fighting genre. I adored the mixture of classic gameplay with new user-friendly elements. If the developers had enhanced the story mode, then this would have been exceptional.",,,,,,,,"The King of Fighters XV is a great fighting game and SNK did a good job on bringing it up to par with the likes of the competition. However the game has a fantastic roster, great gameplay and is looking fantastic, there are still a few things missing. You can't really unlock things, there aren't as many modes as you would wish and the story just isn't that long. If those things were better, then the game which already kicks ass, would bring even the greatest of competitors on its knees.",,"Overall this seems like a game that would be good for die hard fighting fans who love playing against other people, but not recommended for anyone looking for a substantial single player experience.",,"The King of Fighters XV succeeds where it was expected to, that is, by offering a precise and intense gameplay wrapped in a high-quality presentation, and that’s probably the most important element. The plethoric roster is varied, the mechanics are intuitive, and one ends up spending a few hours to fully master them. Nevertheless, for those among us who are less fervent of this genre, beware as this is a versus fighting game in its purest form and it doesn’t offer much more. Best reserved for those fond of it.",,,,,,,,"King of Fighters XV completes the storyline from the previous game but doesn’t mark any significant changes otherwise. It’s an excellent overall fighter and likely to find some pull on the tournament circuit. Yet, at this point, we can’t help but feel like this is all something we’ve played many times before.",,,,,"The King of Fighters XV is a huge upgrade over its predecessor in its visuals and presentation, and its minor tweaks to gameplay make an already stellar franchise even better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"SNK has always produced solid entries in the KoF series, and The King of Fighters XV is no exception. Even though players will be split on the usual character shuffling, the fighting remains as tight and fast as ever, despite the move from sprites to polygons. The single-player experience feels fair compared to the company's older output. Although the game is largely the same as before, the much-improved presentation makes it feel more like a finished product. With the online performance in a good place so far, KoF XV feels like a significant improvement over the previous title. Fighting fans will certainly be happy with this iteration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The King of Fighters XV may lack the bells and whistles of its more famous contemporaries, but it makes up for that with strong combat mechanics and online play that manages to keep up with the fast-paced action the series is known for.",,,,,,,,"King of Fighters XV is a wonderful addition to the series. If you are like me and are hoping for an expansion of the single player modes though, you are going to be disappointed. Still the roster and game play are excellent and the online modes are robust.

far-cry-6,"Far Cry 6 may be my favourite entry into the series. The ridiculous weapons, wonderful Amigos, beautiful scenery and charismatic Esposito made it a fantastic experience for me. Although it doesn’t ‘reinvent the wheel’, it knows it’s audience and did improve and add some new ideas. If you enjoy the Far Cry series, you should definitely make some time to visit Yara.","Far Cry 6 is as Far Cry as Far Cry gets. It may be cut from the same cloth as previous entries almost identically, but when the action is this fun and the world is this expansive and full of things to do, I’m not going to complain. The title alone will let you know if that’s for you, but if it is, you’re in for one hell of a ride.","Far Cry 6 barely hangs together on the strength of the gameplay loop it inherits from its predecessors. Beyond the addition of some fun new toys, like the “resolver” weapons and Supremo backpacks, nearly every design change is mystifyingly for the worse, and the mismatch between the gameplay and storytelling ambitions is more conspicuous than ever.",,"Far Cry 6 is a slow burner, but once it gets going it really sinks those hooks. Fans of the series will have a blast, whether alone or through the cooperative options. Granted, the menus can sometimes over complicate things, and the cutscene stutters are annoying, but the main point to take away is that if you love open world games, especially those which provide fun, excitement and the freedom of choice, then come to Yara. It's not a huge revolution, but it's a fun one.",,"Everything is wrapped in an impressive graphic section, and that will make us feel that we are facing a true next-gen title. Obviously some minor problems can be attributed to the game, such as an AI that sometimes acts in a somewhat strange way or some typical bugs of an open world game and that do not cloud the experience too much. Removing this, the truth is that it is difficult for me to get any more black points out of this Far Cry 6, which for me is, without a doubt, the best game in the saga.","Far Cry 6 is… exactly that. If you enjoy the formula of the series, this new entry will give many, many hours of fun, but don’t expect anything new or revolutionary.",,"Far Cry 6 is like Far Cry 5, 4, and 3. Despite an incredible performance from Giancarlo Esposito of Breaking Bad fame, there's very little new or fresh about this latest sandbox shooter.",,"As the most expansive instalment in the franchise to date, Far Cry 6 is literally the GTA V of Far Cry games, with a solid story, vibrant, engaging characters and no shortage of things to do alone or online with a friend; for FPS action-adventure fans this is a MUST BUY.","Far Cry 6 immerses us in a large open world with a ton of possibilities and a great cast of characters, but it fails to make a real splash compared to previous installments in the series, while also providing a too-low challenge level to the player.","Far Cry 6 is a great representative of the formula that Ubisoft has been refining. The modifications introduced, such as the elimination of the skill tree, have suited the game quite well. The story in this installment, the villain, the allies, every element that contributes to the narrative are something remarkable. Plus the setting looks exceptionally good. However, it's still not a next-gen experience. The main flaw the game has is in the AI of the enemies which makes them often easy to defeat.","Far Cry 6 is without a doubt Ubisoft’s most ambitious entry into the series, offering a huge map and more activities than you could possibly want. Giving us a classic Far Cry experience the whole way through, with a smattering of new ideas and fresh takes, Far Cry 6 is perfect for fans of the series. Although some of the newer mechanics don’t seem to have the desired effect, I can still safely say that this is my favourite entry into the series to date, and I recommend you book a trip to Yara as soon as you can. Viva Libertad!",,"Starting to feel like a case of diminishing returns, Far Cry 6 retreads the same formula that's stood the series in good stead for a while, but it's a formula that's starting to wear a bit thin. Still, there's some fun to be had here, despite there being little that's new or innovative.","We end up with a very efficient production, reconnecting with the exotic atmosphere specific to the saga and supported by some commendable efforts in terms of storytelling. Solid Far Cry, no doubt.",,"Although struggling to propose a convincing villain, Far Cry 6 offers a lot of gameplay innovations that make this chapter one of the most fun to play.",,,,"I’m still jugging through the story and exploring Yara and having a great time. It’s a good time to invest in a game like this when there aren’t too many new titles in the genre coming soon. The shortcomings are minimal and I’m sure I have a lot more to discover. Fans of Giancarlo Esposito will enjoy his inclusion, as he does a fantastic job of playing a villain you love to hate.",,,,,,,"Let's be clear from the get-go: Far Cry 6 does not intend to renew its famous recipe. However, it does offer a convincing experience relying on elements that worked well in the previous episodes while bringing in some welcome new features. The biggest one is undoubtedly the arrival of 3rd person cinematics in which our character is no longer mute. Far Cry 6 offers a well-written storyline that will keep us on the edge of our seats for about twenty hours. It also depicts the magnificent island of Yara with a Latin soundtrack that will have no trouble making us travel around the globe. There are few changes to the gameplay itself, but we did notice the disappearance of the skill tree in favour of scavenging for pieces of equipment, each with its own abilities. Far Cry 6 thus slowly goes on with its light RPG approach initiated with the New Dawn episode. You can complain about the AI of the enemies, which is still limited, but the pleasure felt when playing the game is enough to get past it. Far Cry 6 is certainly one of the best chapters since the third one that was ever so appreciated by the fans.",,,,,,"It’s illustrative of the broader conflict Far Cry 6 finds itself facing with, well… itself. It wants to spin a more involved narrative, but steps back before things get too serious. Yaran Stories hint at deeper worldbuilding, though adhering to the standard Far Cry and open world structure means staleness creeps into exploration and guerrilla activities. Juan Cortez was more accurate than he realized when he recruited Dani to Libertad. Far Cry 6 prefers playing guerrilla over more serious reflection because “blowing up shit is fun,” and Ubisoft just isn’t quite ready to give that up yet.",,"Far Cry 6 sits at the dead-end of a decade of sandboxes. Existing primarily as a sprawling checklist, its story shows flashes of excellence in a barrage of bad jokes and sometimes fun but familiar tasks.",,,,,"Far Cry 6 doesn't do a lot to shake up a tried-and-true formula, but still offers up an engaging story and plenty of enjoyable open world mayhem in the series' best setting to date.",,,,"Far Cry 6 smooths over a lot of the bumps that have cropped up in the past few games and even though it misses some steps, especially with its new inventory system, it's the best the series has been in years.",Far Cry 6 is both exceptional and surprising. It gave me more than I ever could have expected from the franchise and has redefined what a Far Cry game can be going forward.,,,,,,"Far Cry 6 is again -and that doesn't surprise anyone- a gigantic game, and not everything in the enormous stream of (side) missions is equally fun, funny or seems to add something to the whole. So you will regularly wonder what you are doing and why, while you will often hope in vain that the next mission is one with a role for Giancarlo Esposito. But with so much content, there is more than enough fun to be had and you will definitely get your Yaran Peso value.",,,,,"Far Cry 6 is a gripping and exciting thrill ride from the opening moments, delivering the best entry the franchise has had in years.",,,"Make no mistakes; Far Cry 6 is, without a doubt, the best Far Cry game in a long time. The game brings back the exotic locations we’ve been missing since Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4 and adds yet another charismatic antagonist to its storied pantheon of villains. But more importantly, it’s a joy to play, with a unique arsenal full of character and breadth of content that is not only comprehensive but engaging.",,,"Far Cry 6 is a solid installment in the series full of fun moments, and a giant map that you can explore at your leisure. However, a series of flaws in several of its aspects prevent this revolution from being as effective as Ubisoft wants it to be.",,,,,"Far Cry 6 starts off strong with a haunting and pretty realistic sequence. During the adventure, we get plenty of similar scenes, but also the exact opposite - and everything in between. It creates an incredibly disjointed experience, but it's actually not as bad as it sounds since the actual gameplay is varied and enjoyable. Instead, it is the high number of bugs and, to say the least, strange behavior from some of the computer controlled characters that lowers the enjoyment a notch.",,,,,,"Far Cry 6 is the ultimate exponent of Ubisoft's open world formula. It’s a great pleasure to explore the island of Yara and all its corners, where we have enormous freedom and options to face all of its challenges. Giancarlo Espostio shines as Antón Castillo, a villain that will go down in Far Cry history, even if the other characters in the narrative are not up to him. A must for fans of open world games.",Far Cry 6 keeps the spirit of the saga but seeks to innovate with new mechanics that try to leave behind what no longer works or tires the player.,,,,,,,"Far Cry 6 is just another Far Cry game, one that desperately wants to utilize the imagery of a revolution without having anything meaningful to say about one.","Despite some of the zannyness of the overall experience, the meaty “gritty and grounded” story content is top shelf, and it’s difficult to not just want more and more of Esposito’s Castillo. And you’ll definitely be playing awhile, especially if you choose to go all-in on the game’s many treasure hunts and other game-world challenges.",,,,,"Ubisoft knows how to make a fun open-world FPS, but the series that once famously saw a villain wax poetic about insanity seems to have forgotten its own definition of the term.",,,,,,,"Sticking to a well-practiced formula but making smart, thoughtful enhancements, Far Cry 6 is a satisfying adventure through a beautiful setting in the tropical island of Yara. Some of its darker themes are glossed over a bit too quickly, but the story and the incredibly likeable characters you’ll meet along the way make for a memorable romp, with a once again compelling villain and, for the first time, a hero to truly root for. With a gigantic open world filled with delightful distractions, Far Cry 6 is the strongest entry in the series and is a great example of evolving a popular franchise into something special.","But the ""6"" in ""Far Cry 6"" means you know what you're getting at this point, so none of this should be exceptionally surprising. Longtime fans were worried about things like reduced customizations for Dani and the first-person cutscenes, but the real issue here is that the formula feels less sustainable now more than ever. The big, beautiful country of Yara was squandered by Far Cry staples, and it'd be a shame to see that happen to whatever world comes next.",,"Far Cry 6 welcomes us to a fascinating setting in the middle of the Caribbean with a good dose of personality, adequate characters, a great sense of humor, and new mechanics. This is a game that you will enjoy especially if you are Latin American and a follower of the series. However, the core of gameplay remains almost intact, which makes this new installment feel like a skin that also comes with its fair share of bugs.",,,"Far Cry 6 is another well-crafted entry in Ubisoft's long-running franchise. While the framework of the series is still in place, the title introduces welcome changes such as a real protagonist and extensive customization that make this an improvement on its predecessor.","Far Cry 6 is going to be somewhat divisive. Those that enjoy the series for its sandbox and the ability to wreak havoc with a large assortment of weapons and vehicles may find this to be the best the series has ever been. Those, like me, who enjoyed the antagonists, and the more scripted main missions may be disappointed to see the new villain, played by the brilliant Giancarlo Espacito, almost completely wasted. He barely makes a presence and when he does, the series is too comfortable treading the same ground as past titles. Nonetheless, this is an excellent Open-World shooter that trades any surprises it may have for very solid, streamlined Ubisoft gameplay.",,,,,,"This feels like a far more honest take on what Far Cry is to most people: a joyful, chaotic toybox. There’s room for improvement – the questionable Latin American representation, for a start – but there’s no doubt this is something of an awakening for the series, exploring ideas I’m excited to see refined in iterations to come. In particular, doing away with the cumbersome pretence of political salvation leaves you free to pick and choose your own adventure, whether that’s toppling Castillo or just being crowned Gran Primo champion. Like Yara, Far Cry 6 is brimming with potential – you just have to step up and shape it.","Far Cry 6 may not move the needle much in terms of innovation, but it executes what makes these games extremely fun to play.",,,,,,"What can I say? I’m just a sucker for the big maps, checklists, and pretty islands of Far Cry. I had a blast taking down yet another dictator and his army of warriors. I also get why, for so many, this formula has started to wear thin, and why they are tired of repeating history over and over. Perhaps I’m just out of my mind, damned to keep playing Far Cry games for the rest of my life. As someone once said, “Insanity is doing the exact...same fucking thing...over and over again.”",,,,,"The latest entry in the Far Cry series brought many little joys, great performance by Giancarlo Esposito and beautiful tropical environments. Alas, it is annoying and disappointing in too many aspects. The story should have been approached more seriously, Yara is not a believable world and some of its areas are empty, while the gameplay suffers from copy-pasted assets and bugs that shouldn’t pollute a game from such an experienced developer. Overall, Far Cry 6 is a letdown. [12/2021, p.26]",,,,,"Far Cry 6 is a fun return to the series that feels both familiar and fresh. The new gear and weapons systems are compellingly fun, and the setting of Yara is a joy to get lost in. It doesn't quite escape the series' trademark foibles, but the interlocking gameplay systems and mechanics mesh satisfyingly to create a compelling open-world adventure. Far Cry 6 does enough to push the franchise's issues to the background most of the time, offering up an enjoyable experience that looks good, plays well and succeeds in capturing the essence of the series.",,,,,,,"Far Cry 6 successfully manages to reinvent the formula into the best version of the series. If you have never touched a Far Cry game, or have been irked by some of the changes since Far Cry 3, this is your entry point. Even better, it is one of the few games that have come out since the launch of PS5 and Xbox Series X to deliver a full AAA experience that doesn’t feel rushed or unfinished. Along with the buttery smooth framerate from the Xbox Series X, this feels like one of the first games made with next-gen as a priority. Far Cry 6 is an amazing journey in one of the most expansive iterations of the series to date. With explosive performances from the whole cast, it’s a game that old fans and intrigued wannabe guerrillas shouldn’t sleep on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"At the moment, it’s still more Far Cry. The upside of that: It’s loads and loads of fun, story be damned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Far Cry 6 has some explosive action, but in my 25-or-so hours of gameplay the stretches between the most explosive missions bring the experience down. Yara is huge and full of things to explore, but exploration should not mean ""walk 1000 in-game meters to get an objective that sends me 2000 meters in the opposite direction. Every character is expertly portrayed--not the least of which is Giancarlo Esposito, whose Anton Castillo ranks right near the top of best Far Cry villains. The world and the people in it are interesting, interesting enough to overcome the monotony, but getting there can certainly be difficult. Far Cry 6 doesn't move the needle at all, but it still holds its own amongst the other shooter games available.",,,,,,,,
moonglow-bay,"Despite the few bugs and glitches I encountered, I found myself easily sinking hours at a time into Moonglow Bay. Its familiarity, the need to help someone going through the same grief I had experienced myself, the nostalgic voxel art and delightful music all really made me escape into this coastal community and really feel like I was part of all of it. It was clearly developed by a passionate team who took care to really make it feel this way. I think it may have benefitted from a bit longer development time, but they pushed out a patch quickly and I will take on another playthrough of it before too long. I loved the idea of helping to save a small town like I grew up in and I look forward to spending some more time chilling in Moonglow Bay soon.","The chill nature of the gameplay, the exploration of the oceans, finding new fish and completing quests for the townsfolk meshed together to make a really rather enjoyable time. Moonglow Bay is the perfect palette cleanser in between other grittier titles, and another solid addition to the Game Pass service.",,,"Moonglow Bay is not without its flaws. It’s too undercooked, with bugs and knotty boss moments. But its story of fighting back from grief and depression swells the heart, and we could happily spend a half-hour every day in its world.

In the long run it's a bit too repetitive, despite an engaging story.",,,"Exploring the seas to find new fish, complete quests, and uncover the game’s overarching mystery is never tiresome as Moonglow Bay’s ambiance and gameplay combine for a relaxing experience. It’s a lovely game all around with a few small but ultimately insignificant complaints that could be lodged. Truly, dive into Moonglow Bay and bask in its sweet serenity.","It’s meant to be pleasant and cozy, and everything about it – from the folksy characters, to the fiddle music, to the lovely voxel art – is designed to be as warm and upbeat and wholesome as possible. And more often than not, it succeeds at being a pleasant experience. You wouldn’t think a fishing game, of all things, as being cuddly and cozy and inviting – but Moonglow Bay proves that it’s not just possible, it’s also pretty fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Moonglow Bay is a fun and relaxing game that I found very rewarding to play, there’s a huge variety of things to do in this game so I never get tired of it. Every day I play I can’t wait to go back and see what monster-sized fish I manage to catch and see what kind of new dishes I get to create in the kitchen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Moonglow Bay is that sort of game that we could call ""an experience"" more than a simple video game.

Fishing has never been my thing, until now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Building the ultimate Inner Sanctum, complete with devious traps and scurrying minions is a lot of fun. But the news isn’t all good. Less enjoyable are some of the game’s busywork missions, lack of clarity around goals, and overall feeling of outstaying its welcome. Playing in the sandbox mode helps with the tedium, but overall Evil Genius 2 would be a better game if lost some complexity and padding, and focused on what it does best.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An excellent console port of a deep, impressively addictive, and very amusing, sandbox megalomaniac simulator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A promising entry to the long-lasting legacy of Dungeon Keeper that lacks in both variety and depth long-term.

metal-hellsinger,,,,"Metal Hellsinger is a slick and addictive rhythm FPS with style and attitude to spare. With shooter action that's heavily reminiscent of Bethesda's 2016 DOOM reboot mashed together with superbly well-realised rhythm game aspects that enhance the core combat experience, this is a fiendishly satisfying arcade game that sucks you right into its twisted hellscapes and refuses to let you go. Get ready for some super-sweaty Heavy Metal vengeance.",Metal: Hellsinger on Xbox Series X|S isn’t quite the Symphony of Destruction we were hoping for. It feels more akin to a band’s debut EP; a noteworthy introduction but one that is just a snapshot into the potential.,,It’s ROCKS!!! Metal: hellsinger is the perfect “heavy metal” FPS. It’s like a music disc with a free game inside.,,,,,Metal: Hellsinger is a scream come true for metal music FPS fans and could make anyone a fan of The Metal.,"If taken as a simple FPS, Metal: Hellsinger would be an average one, due to non-stellar graphics, short levels and repetitive boss fights. But add its heavy metal rhythm game gameplay to the mix, and you'll find yourselves captivated by the challenge of flawlessly executing every level, aiming to obtain the highest multiplier possible by hitting enemies following the great head-banging music tracks.","Metal: Hellsinger is an indie that no one who loves shooters, frantic games or rhythm games should miss out on, especially if they have already played works like the DOOM franchise before, as this game will steal their hearts with its song.",,,"A hardcore heavy-metal shooter boasting a side order of rhythm with its brutal ultra-violence, Metal: Hellsinger is good fun, but you'll probably get a lot more out of it if you actually enjoy the music.","In its way of transforming the fast FPS into a raging rhythm game, thanks to the support of an impeccable soundtrack, Metal: Hellsinger gave us a few hours of pure adrenaline. The gameplay loop is mastered, the instinctive handling and the multiple levels of difficulty allow you to create an à la carte experience. The fact remains that the content is a little too light, since we will complete the main campaign in 5 to 6 hours depending on the desired challenge. The challenges, however, allow you to extend the lifespan, but it is above all the interest in scoring and the desire to climb the world rankings that will allow you, or not, to play Metal: Hellsinger for more than 10 hours. As it is, it's still an experience to try if you like ""Doom Like"" and big guitar riffs.",,,"It's not all that unique, with games like BPM: Bullets Per Minute already ""inventing"" some of these concepts, but the quality is undeniable, and FPS fans should not skip this one for sure. Especially since it's launching day one into Xbox Game Pass.",,,"I really found myself engrossed with Metal: Hellsinger, and the solid FPS gunplay paired with a challenging rhythm mechanic keeps you pretty engaged throughout. It’s a neat concept that certainly hasn’t worn out its welcome so far, and I’d certainly like to see it expanded upon in the future, so hopefully a sequel or DLC won’t be out of the question. Definitely check it out Metal: Hellsinger if any of this sounds intriguing, you won’t be disappointed.","Metal: Hellsinger is relatively short, and while there are additional challenges you can complete if you fell in love with it, that’s mostly a good thing. While its core mechanics are strong, and I love its soundtrack, it’s a one-dimensional game where you’ll have seen most everything it has to offer quickly. At that point, it’s just a matter of how much you enjoy the feel of it. While it won’t be for everyone, it’s absolutely a game those with Game Pass should give a chance.",,,,,,"For those fond of metal music and Doom, Metal: Hellsinger had all the ingredients to rock our hearts. The final product is as good as we hoped it would be and we loved the adventure albeit it being a little too short. Considering its efficient gameplay mixed with a delightful banger soundtrack, we were gutted to see the credits roll after less than 5 hours: we wanted more! If headbanging is your jam, Metal: Hellsinger is the way to go, especially as it is released day one in the Xbox Game Pass.",,,,,,,,,,"Overall, if you are a metalhead like me then this is absolutely the fps you need to try. It’s free on Xbox Gamepass currently, so no excuse not to try it! The game’s negatives are quite minor, and I could not stop headbanging to the beat all the way through the campaign. There is nothing quite like getting into the zone and chaining together a string of shoot, jump, dash, reload on the beat in Metal Hellsinger. Here’s hoping for some DLC or a fully fledged sequel so we can do it all over again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While not perfect in all areas, the craft on display in Metal: Hellsinger is a testament to the beauty and precision that a focused project with a great vision can yield.",,,,,,"Metal: Hellsinger is a raw, old-school style of FPS, which a kick ass soundtrack that showcases a new rhythm mechanic (using original music from the team) while including lots of things from the recent versions of the Doom franchise. ‘Glory Kills’, air dashing and more are all here but even with those elements the developers have done enough to make Metal: Hellsinger feel different and unique all on its own. Its inclusion of the rhythm mechanics and even the ‘bullet hell’ aspects of some fights that have players dodging bullets and enemies around an arena is one of those things. This might not be the best example of a demon slaying game done right, but this is a fantastic tribute to those that have come before and a great example of thinking outside the box and taking a change on something different in a sea of sameness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Metal: Hellsinger enlists some all-star musical talent to bring its dream of metal-based FPS mayhem to life, but stumbles in finding its gameplay rhythm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The claustrophobic atmospheres, the excellent audio production and the tense script filled with jumpscares are accompanied by small but significant improvements in the game formula. Definitely a game to have if you love narrative horror experiences.","The Devil in Me brilliantly closes The Dark Pictures Anthology first season. A careful and exciting story, a cast of interesting characters, complex decision-making, and an experience much more focused on exploration are some of its main elements. Despite some small technical problems that are already common in the saga, The Devil in Me is an absolute must for horror fans.",,,"The Devil in Me is the most assured entry yet in The Dark Pictures Anthology, even if it doesn't produce quite enough scares during its seven hour runtime.","While staying true to The Dark Pictures franchise, The Devil in Me attempts to innovate by incorporating an inventory system and characters with real-world expertise. By taking on America's first serial killer, the game manages to instill an interesting vibe with its ""Castle of Murders."" Unfortunately, and although we are curious about the fate of each of the protagonists, the title struggles to convince completely. The story takes a long time to start, the pace is a little too slow – despite some nice finds – and we feel little empathy for the characters, stereotypical as possible. If we add a gameplay that accumulates clichés seen and reviewed, The Devil in Me does not have the content of The Quarry or even of a House of Ashes. Despite everything, the formula works thanks to the place inspired by a real event and a finale rich in tension.","The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil in Me is a fantastic horror adventure title. With 5 unique characters and a dark story, this is one game that'll chill you to the bone. Furthermore, you must remember that every decision matters and death is eerily close.",,"Without a doubt, this is the best Dark Anthology game so far and a true climax to season one. Not only fans of the series but fans of the genre will love playing this. The acting, visual detail, sound design and writing could not be bettered here. Series mechanics have not only been improved but also extended delivering an extra level of depth to a fantastic experience. In short developer, Supermassive Games has delivered a horror classic that will keep players on the edge of their seats for hours.",,,,,,,,,,"And one more to the list! Not trying to reinvent the formula of the previous games of its anthology, The Devil in Me is the annual guilty pleasure for fans of the genre. Supported by a relatively interesting cast and a gripping plot, this iteration follows the series's recipe. Unfortunately, there are no new ingredients and there is nothing to get excited about either, as the game is filled to the brim with glitches and technical problems, to the point where you end up preferring the dialogue scenes to actual gameplay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We love the more realistic story approach and character set of The Devil in Me as well as the expanded gameplay mechanics. Don't expect a totally different experience or an absolute genre high flier from the season's finale, but in any case the best episode inside The Dark Pictures Dye Anthology so far.",,,,,,,"At the end of the day, The Devil in Me feels like a safe bet for the series. Sure, it may not be imaginative like House of Ashes or Little Hope, but it serves as a decent choice-driven horror game that I didn’t mind going through the padding to see what was going to happen next. While this is the “season finale” of The Dark Pictures Anthology, I wonder if it will ever really return? I guess we’ll see. In the meantime, The Devil in Me offers a decent experience with little to no issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It should look to Playground Games and how they craft an elite open-world sports game if they want to reach that next-level, then maybe they too could be mentioned in the same breath as SSX Tricky. Fingers crossed, the potential is definitely there!","If Riders Republic may disappoint Steep fans (the title goes against the spirit of the game of 2016), this new production remains a must for all thrill seekers. With its many playable sports disciplines, starting with the bike which offers exhilarating sensations, its exotic world and its many modes available both solo and online, the latest production from Ubisoft Annecy will undoubtedly keep you busy for the long haul.",,"Riders Republic is the game designed for all lovers of extreme sports, orphans of a product capable of satisfying their desire for adrenaline. The new Ubisoft title, net of some technical problems, is the new meeting place for fans of tricks and thrilling races.",,,"Then there’s just simply the atmosphere. This game is absolutely gorgeous. The levels are based on seven real locations in the Southwestern United States, each with faithfully recreated topography and landmarks. The game is filled with landmarks to find and read flavor text about. It has totally inspired me to visit some of these locations someday, hopefully before they’re gone, whether due to climate change or just the course of nature, as the game heeds on several occasions. You can play the game in Zen mode to explore unperturbed or really get lost traveling slowly from location to location between events and just enjoy the environment ad nauseam. I highly recommend it.",,,,,,,,"Let’s not kid ourselves: Riders Republic was a disappointment. Even if it’s not a bad game per se, the title offers a gameplay that is globally too arcade-like and doesn’t manage to sustain the player’s interest over time. It’s a pity because there are some good ideas such as the possibility to create your own challenges or the Mass Races, all of it on a huge and varied playground. With a more fine-tuned gameplay, a general tone that doesn’t miss the point as much and a better made customisation system, we would have had a game as service solid enough to be praised among extreme sports fans.",,,,,,,,"Ubisoft's second effort into mountain and extreme sports is an obvious hit. Leveraging the tech of modern platforms makes Riders Republic a fast-moving, always exciting open world, but it also makes room for those who just want to soak up the scenes of life from the mountaintop. While the audio tracks may have you reaching for the mute button, it's maybe a better experience with your own custom soundtrack free of the super-dorks roaming the cutscenes anyway. In a year where Ubisoft's sandboxes were seeming stale, Riders Republic manages to keep me chasing down every icon like I rarely do anymore.",,,,,,,,"Riders Republic is a hell of a good time, a freeform open-world sports game that encourages you to follow your passion and find your own fun.","Riders Republic is an excellent, arcadey extreme sports sandbox with bonkers multiplayer events, an impressive open world, and unfortunate server issues.",,,,,,,,"The game crashed on the Xbox Series X semi-frequently, but I pressed on, knowing that right around the corner I was likely to find some new thing that would surprise and delight me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Riders Republic is a game with an annoying attitude, an alarming number of different sports and an overwhelming world map. Despite that, the game impress with great controls, varied challenges and a world filled with fun activities. In addition, the fact that we are not spoiled with well-made ski, snowboard and bike games, makes Riders Republic a more than welcome addition to the genre.",,,,"I suspect Riders Republic might be something very special indeed. We’ll have to wait and see what the community does with it, but early signs look promising. There’s a rock-solid foundation to build upon, and such a wide range of events to take on that each set a high bar in terms of what could come next. It does feel a little directionless at present. There's simply so much on offer that it's difficult to find focus within the noise. This direction and focus will likely be shaped by the community in the coming months, as user-created content takes over from the events on show at launch...Whether you want to race on a bike, fly through rings with a rocket strapped to your back, or simply explore the gorgeous natural views, Riders Republic has you covered. If you can handle the incessant hipster speak, that is.",,,,"To conclude, Riders Republic is clearly a good game that will certainly delight gamers who love thrills and extreme sports. We'll put aside the aspect of microtransactions in a game sold at a high price which darkens the picture a bit, because it remains a very good game experience. Technically, the game is not as good as Forza Horizon, even if it is strongly inspired by it in its gameplay structure, but the map is simply brilliant, large and full of surprises for the ingenious players who like exploration. A very good end of year surprise to be consumed without moderation, but while wearing a helmet.",,,,,,"Riders Republic is a fun game that offers a wide range of exhilarating and unique activities that mostly benefit from its 'always online' gameplay model, but also suffers from a few shortcomings. The world feels alive, the Events are a blast and the game looks gorgeous. However, some aspects of the game are a little lacking at launch, namely the multiplayer modes, customisation and air sports.",,"Riders Republic’s failures in effectively catering for newcomers - despite its excellent range of accessibility features - are clear for me as a newbie. But anyone experienced with this genre will have a bloody fantastic time here, and it's well worth picking up if you’re into it.","Riders Republic isn't called Steep 2 because of new gameplay functionnalities and its added little bit of craziness, but at its core it really is just a sequel, without much innovation. Still fun to play though, if you find your own pace through the repetitiveness.",,,,,,,,,,"Riders Republic offers a cornucopia of extreme sporting choices for players to choose from. By giving enough attention and fine-tuning to each individual sport, it has created an evergreen title to receive future updates or expansions to build upon well into the future. With a solid foundation offering solo and group players fun and exciting experiences, Riders Republic has set the stage incredibly well. While its predecessor Steep failed to capture a lasting audience, I feel strongly that Riders stands a much greater chance at retaining players’ interest due in part to its tongue-in-cheek tone combined with the game’s sheer variety of extreme sports adventures and energetic open world. I look forward to returning to Riders Republic to bike down mountain paths or fly through narrow canyon gaps while listening to alt-rock radio sometime soon.",,,,,,"Owing to its precise gameplay and satisfying open-world, Riders Republic has the makings of an extreme sport fan's dream. It just would have been nice if the title's exhausting and obnoxious attitude had been checked at the door.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Ubisoft builds upon the framework of Steep with this enjoyably eccentric open world extreme sports adventure. [Eurogamer Recommended],,,,,,,,,,,"Riders Republic has managed to tweak the majority of small gripes that were in place in an already fun beta release and in its final version, given gamers easily the best extreme sports simulator on the market - ironically done by embracing the craziness of the sports themselves and making events increasingly zanier as progression is made. For purists, they will find the type of experience that will link them in memory, back to the seasons of being out there on the trails and slopes (or in the air if anyone has actually tried that mental gliding thing). For the stay-at-home gamer, this really is as close as it feels to being out there with the added enjoyment of the extreme element pushed to its… well, extreme, all without a scraped knee or full reconstructive surgery in sight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fifa-23,,,,"FIFA 23 marks the end of a thirty year era for EA and, thankfully, it does so by sending this long-running series off on something of a high note. FUT has seen some excellent changes in its chemistry mechanics and the addition of single player Moments, whilst on the pitch this is the best the game's felt to play in quite some time. Women's club footie finally arrives on the scene, set-pieces have seen a slick revamp, power shots are a fantastically arcadey addition to the action and overall this is just a hugely engaging and generous package that's stuffed full of ways to play on and offline.","Whilst there are areas of FIFA 23 that still need improvement and some modes are stagnant, the gameplay is the best it’s been for a few iterations.",,FIFA 23 is the last entry of the saga that joined EA and FIFA. A game that introduces few new features but where HyperMotion 2 starts to show what it can become in the future.,,,,,,"FIFA 23 further refines its formula with new features leading to a more reasoned game and increased freedom for players. A top-notch title, that every fan should consider for their collection.","I think that FIFA 23 is a game that can convince the newest players but that it may stay a bit the same as the previous one for the most veterans who were expecting even more changes. Also, this game is very worthwhile if you really love football unconditionally.",,,"FIFA 23 is the best FIFA game that you can play right now. But unless you’re an Ultimate Team diehard, FIFA 23 might not do enough to convince you to upgrade from the mechanically similar FIFA 22.","While FIFA 23's new set piece and power kick system won't appeal to everyone, version 2 of the Hypermotion engine does wonders for player animations and rendering. On the other hand, this opus improves the career mode in a beautiful way, especially when one embodies a player and tries to dust off FIFA Ultimate Team thanks to “Moments” and a new way of thinking about the collective. Something to shake up the regulars a bit. In short, if it does not revolutionize its formula, this FIFA 23 is one of the most complete in the saga before moving to EA Sports FC.",,,"In short, FIFA 23 makes a lot of great additions to the core gameplay, making the actual football feel smoother, more realistic and tactically more diverse, with the new AcceleRATE system in particular ensuring that fast players no longer dominate the online sphere. Tons of behind the scenes changes like a new physics system, a revamped AI, and the long-awaited cross-play make this year’s installment of EA Sports’ eternal franchise the most fresh experience it’s been in years. On the flipside, aside from adding women teams and tweaking a few game modes, content-wise the game has very little new to offer compared to FIFA 22, to a point that casual players may barely even notice most of this year’s changes. A transition game of sorts before next year’s name change, making a lot of important changes under the game’s hood, without really reinventing or adding any standout feature. Whether these changes are essential enough for a buy or not largely depend on the way you play FIFA.",,,,,,,,,,"Without being the best thing since sliced bread, FIFA 23 is undoubtedly the most accomplished title of the series. The introduction of cross-play is a refreshing add, as is the change in commentators. Whether in terms of graphics or gameplay, the few small improvements made to the best-selling sports title in the world are quite satisfying. Managing the defence finally becomes interesting and one has a real chance to counter the previously overpowered strikers. The career mode, whether you are a coach or a player, is very immersive, which will delight the most demanding fans. Although there have been few changes to the FUT, its well-oiled mechanics will allow fans to indulge in creating their dream team. Lastly, the interaction between Volta and Club Pro is well thought out as it allows one to play with friends in different game modes. Ladies and gentlemen, all you have to do is put on your boots and get kickin’!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"FIFA 23 makes history as the most realistic football simulator in the series and with HyperMotion technology getting increasingly more impressive, the future looks bright for EA SPORTS FC. Some gameplay fine-tuning is needed to streamline things and the SBC change in Ultimate Team won't be a welcome one, but there's no denying it's the best on-pitch action in years.",,,,,"EA improves on its predecessor for the umpteenth time, once again delivering the best football game around. The new power shots, the revamped set piece system and women's club teams are welcome, but anyone expecting big changes will want to hope EA Sports FC 24 delivers.",,,,,,,,,,"There’s a famous saying from former footballer Gary Lineker that “football is a simple game – 22 men chase a ball for 90 minutes – and at the end, the Germans always win.” I want to make a similar assessment of EA’s yearly soccer game: FIFA 23 is a good game – it’s flashy, fun to play, and has a lot of modes – but in the end, you realize it’s mostly the same game you’ve been playing for years.",,,,,,"Once again, instead of offering any significant changes, FIFA 23 opts for the safe path. EA is dismissed from the series in an inconspicuous way.",FIFA 23 is the final penalty for EA and FIFA and they scored it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Football is the world’s most popular game across borders, cultures, politics, and creeds because it offers fans the same exhilaration throughout the world. FIFA 23, when stripped of bland stories, greedy microtransactions, and mind-numbing team management, is a pure, exciting videogame. It’s the excess that ultimately mires it down.",,,,,,,,,,,"FIFA 23, like so many FIFAs before it, sums up the best and worst of football culture - a joyous game in the vice-like grip of profiteers.",,,,,,,,"FIFA 23 is good old FIFA with a lot of little tweaks that will surely appeal to a one part of the fans. If you've skipped a year or two or have a new console, the differences are very noticeable. For others, there are some good improvements and features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"FIFA 23 marks an end of an era. Fittingly, its synthesis of everything good and bad that the franchise had, especially in the last years. It is not at all a breakthrough sports game that will mark a before and after in history, but it is not a disaster either. FIFA 23 lives calmly in the mediocrity that EA made a standard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"FIFA 23 could be seen as a statement of intent for what EA Sports FC will eventually become. Not only is it packed to the rafters with new and original content, its refinement of basic mechanics and animations make it one of the best looking in the series to date, as well as one of the most comfortable to play for veterans and newcomers alike, despite some small but noticeable flaws.","EA took great care and brought a farewell worthy of the last FIFA. FIFA 23 brings a lot of interesting new features, cameos - like the members of Ted Lasso -, gameplay improvements that really add to the game, not to mention it's actually much better looking than the previous games. The really first FIFA of the new generation of consoles will also be the last, and while it brings some of the frustrations already known to fans, it will be a good gateway to the next generation of EA football games.",,,,,,,,,,,,
nobody-saves-the-world,,So I am actually impressed with Nobody Saves the World. Drinkbox Studios have a very fun and interesting graphical design about their games although on first impression they can seem a bit childish when you see the haunting eyes of some of your forms you realise it is for a slightly more mature audience. The way they have handled progression in this game is a breath of fresh air and I look forward to playing this game through to completion.,,"Drinkbox Studios has served up another great time here with a colourful and clever dungeon-crawling adventure that gives you a ton of options as to how you approach its challenges. Switching up forms, mixing and matching skills and hoovering up an absolute ton of loot is addictive stuff here and, although it can be a tad repetitive, this is one of the slickest indie RPGs we've played in quite some time.","Games like Hades have made the dungeon crawler thrive by treating it like a high-end watch. The inner workings are intricate and polished, making it a joy to play over and over. But Nobody Saves the World takes the opposite approach: it doesn’t look inwardly, polishing something to the nth degree. It blows open the doors and makes exploration and progression the focus. It gives you the world.",,,,,"Nobody Saves the World is a humorous romp through a 2D world where the hero is little more than a pale, pantsless shell that players can magically transform into a colorful cast of characters. RPG elements let players customize the experience even further as they rack up a body count of baddies.",,,,,"Nobody Saves the World is a bold change of direction for the team best known for the Guacamelee! games, and the gamble pays off. It's a creative ARPG that rewards experimentation brilliantly, and even without memeing as hard as its lucha-masked stablemates (does anything?), it manages to entertain all the same with its own blend of tight combat, hugely customisable classes, daft humour, and a well-told narrative.",,,"With Nobody Saves The World, DrinkBox Studios once again proves its talent, between a wacky setting and a relevant game system.",,,,,"Nobody Saves the World is another fun-filled game by the team at Drinkbox Studios. While there were very few memorable NPCs, the forms are really what shines the most. From being able to customize them for any need to quickly switching between them, Drinkbox Studios nailed their hook of this game. I just wish they took the time to focus on the game’s villains just as much as they did the many NPCs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nobody Saves the World is a masterclass in the gameplay perspective. It has a unique and clever way of making the rather overwhelming gameplay mechanics into something easy to understand and extremely fun. While it has a lackluster story, and a weird beginning and ending, the fascinating world succeed in making you forget those things, and keep playing with your knife throwing turtle or your fire breathing horse.",,,,,,"Admittedly, I had a hard time putting Nobody Saves The World down to write up this review, and that speaks to how satisfying its rewarding challenge-based progression and surprisingly deep form-changing gameplay are.

Some balancing will make it far more palatable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nobody Saves the World is a sparkling, crazy and easygoing action-adventure, capable of entertaining for a long time and providing hours of genuine fun.",,"Nobody saves the world is a vast array of fun ideas made game, proving once again the talent of the people at DrinkBox Studios. It's easy to grasp and to understand, but a little on the repetitive and easy side, too. A no-brainer if you have Game Pass.",,,,,,,,,"Despite the huge variety of moves and characters, this disappointing follow-up to Guacamelee is let down by mindless combat and bland dungeon design.",,A fascinating ARPG with high doses of dungeon crawler that manages to surprise with its curious gameplay and interesting artwork.,,,,,"Nobody Saves the World could have been exceptional, but there are certain aspects that are lacking. The expected Drinkbox Studios humor isn’t pervasive enough to keep people playing to see what’s next, the story is negligible and seems like something tossed in to give players a half-hearted sense of purpose, and the repetitiveness of quests gets tiresome very quickly. The positives of the game – the appealing art style, variety of skills and dungeons, and perhaps multiplayer — might not be enough to keep players interested either. That being said, the gameplay and presentation of Nobody Saves the World will undoubtedly win over many people, and it may capture the attention of others for a solid chunk of time.",,,"As a slice of classic top-down action-RPG goodness, Nobody Saves the World is the first surprise gem of the year. The fact that it’s available on Xbox Game Pass on PC and Xbox makes it something of a must-play if it's the style of game you dig. Then again there’s enough uniqueness and charm with the class-based Form system to warrant a go for even the most casual of RPG players. Fun, funny, and just all-around great.",,,,,,,"Making your way around Nobody Saves the World‘s map is nothing but a pure joy. This gorgeous, whimsical adventure feels like a more playful A Link to the Past at times – if A Link to the Past had you changing into a slug or a zombie, that is. If you’re a fan of accessible action RPGs and enjoy laying waste to tonnes of enemies, you can’t go wrong here. Once again, Drinkbox Studios has taken an oversaturated genre and turned it into something unique and delightful.","After finishing Nobody Saves the World, I went right back to it. There were still dungeons to explore, powers to unlock, secrets to uncover, and a New Game Plus mode to conquer. When a game is this much frictionless fun, it's hard to resist.",,,,,,,,,,"Nobody Saves the World offers an interesting shapeshifting mechanic that is instrumental to the gameplay; however, the drawn-out reliance on repetitive quests holds it back from metamorphosising into its true potential.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Where Nobody Saves the World finds its sweet spot is when a dungeon rolls up a stout but understandable challenge, requiring a couple minutes of considerate loadout tinkering and then enough fast-twitch gamepad skills to make every shot and strike count. The white-knuckle finishes to these boss fights aren’t a sign your idea barely worked; they’re proof that great video game design, in the hands of an interested and entertained player, can take a happy menagerie of rejects and salvaged parts and make them work together brilliantly.

It's an action RPG definitely worth diving into a dungeon for, with a lot more exploration needed for those looking for every secret.",,,,,"Nobody Saves the World provides a large toybox and an enjoyable world in which to play with it. The Forms at the center of its gameplay feel significantly different from one another and are all exciting to use once you get a handle on them.

cris-tales,,"Cris Tales is a beautiful 2D JRPG with an interesting story and great use of time manipulation. Each of the characters are unique and bring something different to each battle. The way the screen splits to show you the past, present and future is delightful to see and invests you into the game to try and improve the future, while using time powers in battles is well executed and kept me keen on trying different strategies. Hopefully the slow movement outside of battle and the fact there is no difficulty slider doesn’t put people off as there’s a lot to enjoy here in this stunning looking JRPG.",,,"Cris Tales succeeds in what it sets out to do. It isn’t as good as Chrono Trigger but is still a very good RPG in its own right. I hesitate to call it a JRPG as it doesn’t have that feel, but is still as competent and enjoyable a game as I’ve played in a long time, all helped along by a great art style, enjoyable time-bending mechanics and a story that will keep you hooked.",,"A beautiful love letter to the JRPG genre, but with enough personality of its own.",,,,,,"Cris Tales turned out to be a pleasant surprise, managing to impress us for originality and artistic style, as well as interesting gameplay mechanics. Even if it shows a certain inexperience in the general balance of pace and powers, with some of them too overpowered making it almost useless to look for different combinations, it still remains a great homage to classic turn-based JRPGs, so we can only recommend everyone to give it a look.",Cris Tales is a good JRPG that is a turn of the screw on classic turn-based gameplay because it includes the ability to influence on time in the middle of the battle. It also has a very interesting story with an outstanding graphics that are a gift for the sight and all of it accompanied by a great soundtrack.,,,,"With its innovative concept and charming artistic direction, the first title from independent studio Dreams Uncorporated has enough to convince fans of traditional turn-based RPGs looking for a unique experience with a solid foundation. In addition, the accessibility of the title represents an excellent introduction for those who would like to embark on their first J-RPG. Ultimately, Cris Tales sins mainly by some technical details to be reworked.",,,,,"So while Cris Tales’s story and gameplay may come up a bit light for some, it manages to provide a fun, unique experience that, rather than simply imitate the games that came before it, takes inspiration from them and strives to build something unique.",,,,"A clever RPG that combines traditional turn-based gameplay with time manipulation to present an interesting story through many different locations. The story features some time-based puzzling and side-quests that make subtle (or less subtle) changes to the world around you. The random encounters and save points don't add to the fun of the game but in all, a quality, fun RPG.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cris Tales tells a charming JRPG tale in a gorgeous and weird world, but it's hobbled by incredibly monotonous combat.

I’ve had a blast so far going back through the story, and I can’t wait to get back into the rest of the adventure.",,,"What was once the standard-bearer for open-worlds has been overshadowed in the near decade since its first release.

This port effectively uses the technical capacities of next-gen consoles to offer the most pleasant rendering possible, in particular with greatly reduced loading times. Beyond that, GTA V remains what is, namely an incredible open-world filled with activities, but which dates from 2013 and which therefore shows the number of years on certain points such as facial animations. But more than the single-player mode, it's above all GTA Online that stands out as a winner from this arrival on PS5 and Xbox Series with the addition of a tutorial for new players, exclusive content and all the game's graphic and technical improvements. based.

Those of you who are currently playing on the Xbox One version I find it harder to recommend unless you are really into 4K fidelity. There are really not enough additions in the story mode to make it a worthwhile purchase.

That said, what Rockstar has pulled off here is as close to a PC running at max settings, but with a slightly lower draw distance and less feature-rich anti-aliasing. On the other hand, if you are coming from the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox One, the difference is staggering.

For newcomers with little to no experience with the game, this is going to be an absolute treat. For veterans, this may ring a bit hollow.

observer-system-redux,"The gameplay elements may be basic and not exciting on their own, but it’s more about the journey you undertake than reaching the end point. The level design is brilliant and some of the experiences are very memorable even though it has flaws, namely the forced stealth sections. If you’re into the cyberpunk genre and want to experience something completely unique and twisted, look no further than Observer: System Redux, especially if you have an Xbox Series X or S to get the best visual experience unlike any other.","Depsite these niggles I enjoyed my time with The Observer; it looks great, has atmosphere for days and if you cankeep track of what is going on then there is a lot of additional lore to find and piece together. The mind hack sections were the most engaging parts, with some genuinely clever presentation and execution among some truly bizarre imagery and themes. It might not be Bloobers best work, but it’s worth a look if you’re a fan of the team’s games.",,,"Observer: System Redux on Xbox is an example of the ideal remaster. The best bits are amplified; in this case the mangled, filthy cyberpunk visuals and the immersion in a grotesque horror story. Equally, the worst bits are excised, as the terrible stealth sections and the thin exploration are left on the neurosurgeon’s floor. What you’re left with is an emphatic horror title, an easy recommendation to the acquainted and unacquainted, and an experience that will live long in the memory.","The System Redux edition looks stunning with all the advantages of the new generation consoles, but besides that, there is nothing essentially new or improved.","Observer: System Redux is a good proposal, but it repeats the same errors as the original game.","Observer still is a great adventure, full of mystery and with a solid narrative, that looks better than ever with this version.","Observer: System Redux is well worth playing if you enjoy psychological thrillers, a dash of cyberpunk, and noir detective fiction, and it all looks fantastic on the new consoles.

Even so, Observer: System Redux is a great display of survival horror storytelling.",,,"Observer System Redux looks incredible on next-gen consoles, and the improvements to gameplay makes this well worth playing. If you're looking for a psychological thriller to play on your shiny new console, look no further.",,,,,,"Observer plays out much the same way FMV games from the 90s did. Fittingly, players are in this game as an observer, and those who chafe at lack of agency should look elsewhere. This is Daniel Lazarski’s tale, and it’s not a happy one, but it is one worth playing for any sci-fi or cyberpunk fan.",,System Redux brings the original Observer to new heights thanks to revised gameplay mechanics and redesigned visuals. Looks gorgeous on next-gen consoles.,,,,"With Observer’s original atmosphere intact, System Redux is an exceptional refinement and redelivery of one of the generation’s most underrated titles. The loss of Rutger Hauer felt even more profoundly exploring these tenement halls again, but his offbeat and quirky role as Daniel Lazarski will live on for another generation.",,,,,,,,,,"4K and ray-tracing seem to push the Series X to the limit, but in perfomance mode System Redux definitely looks better than the original – and runs smoother. Nonetheless the core stays the same: a weird cyberpunk thriller with repititive mind-games.",,,,,,,,,,,"If you ignore all the needless meddling with graphic options in the console versions of the game, you can call Observer: System Redux a pretty good remaster, with some great visuals and a portion of a completely new content. But at the same time System Redux carries on every single problem the original release had, basically being yet another walking sim. It's quite likely that Observer: System Redux will take its place among some other games, that no one will ever remember a year from now.",,,,,,,"As a remake, Observer: System Redux not only ticks all the right boxes in terms of gameplay improvements but it also showcases what next-gen consoles are capable of for pre-existing titles. Gone are the long loading screens and texture pop-ins of the past. In their place come significantly improved graphics and silky smooth animations, alongside load times that truly make a bigger difference than they seem at first glance. Combined with the quality-of-life enhancements, this remake is certainly worth playing even for those who have already experienced the original title. For those new to the series, though, this is the perfect time to jump in and enjoy Observer: System Redux.",,,,"With visuals completely redesigned from the ground up, rebuilt mechanics, and even a dose of extra content, Observer System Redux delivers on the gritty retrofuturistic cyberpunk world of horror. Rebuilt stealth sections fixed the largest complaint, and the hitching in the original release is gone. The original was good, but this is great.",,,,,,,,,,,"It may not be different enough to justify a replay for those who’ve already experienced the original version, but for those wanting something crisp and clean on new consoles, or for those intrigued by Bloober Team’s work but put off by tense horror, >Observer_ is a great choice.",,,,,,"Observer is still a fascinating game with a compelling story and some really interesting set pieces that both confuse, scare, and bring out emotion. Fans of the adventure genre, especially ones that include investigation and a great cyberpunk coat of paint on it, should pick this one up. Players that already own the original version of Observer may want to think twice if they’re looking for a high-profile visual upgrade. While it’s no slouch in the graphics department, I don’t know if it’s worth double dipping for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Observer was a fine game three-plus years ago, but this re-make is head and shoulders above the original thanks to an awesome presentation, three new side missions, and a price that’s hard to pass up when compared to many games being more than twice as expensive. While we all look forward to Bloober Team’s next one, The Medium, you can’t go wrong with Observer: System Redux if you’re looking for a captivating cyberpunk mystery thriller.",,,,,,,,,">Observer_: System Redux represents a solid improvement over the 2017 original and, therefore, a worthwhile upgrade. It’s a little too long for my liking, but it looks gorgeous at points and tells a terrific story that’s worth experiencing. With a reasonably friendly price, it’s also a relatively cheap way to show off your new toy. Absolutely worth a look.",,,,,,,,,,,"There’s an expectation for next-gen remasters to be cash-grabs, but Bloober Team went beyond resolution upgrades. Observer: System Redux shares a similar release history with Blade Runner: a newer version releasing with extra content and impressive visual polishes. It doesn’t avoid all the pitfalls endemic of walking sims nor of this studio, but it deserves augmented respect like its closest inspiration eventually earned.",,,,,,"Observer: System Redux is an excellent presentation of the masterful environments that indie teams can create on newer hardware. Out the gate, Bloober Team has raised the bar of what we can expect to see graphically, but the gameplay portion of this supernatural adventure limits its overall appeal. Still, I can’t stress enough what a work of art this experience is through its narrative and brilliant sound design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lemnis-gate,,"Of course, if you are someone who likes to keep an eye on new Game Pass entries, it doesn’t take much to see that Lemnis Gate is one of the recent Day One additions to the service, finding players, even with the cross-play option, is something that can take a bit of time but be patient and you’ll have a blast. The gameplay quality is definitely no reason for a lack of players, although it may be a sign of what’s to come with big triple-A shooters inbound.",,,"Lemnis Gate is a very pleasant surprise. A unique, strategic mind-bending FPS, it is mechanically strong and content-rich. There are still some technical issues that need to be resolved and the progression system is very stingy, but what is here is a hidden gem.",,Lemnis Gate is a revolutionary turn-based combat strategy FPS that takes place in a thrilling time loop.,,,,,,,,,,,"Lemnis Gate is a clever and damn well-designed game. Emphasizing tactical choices over pure skill, this original turn-based shooter impresses. Its successful concept mixing FPS and time loops gives rise to refreshing clashes. Too bad some of its content neglects strategy in favor of less interesting direct confrontations. Hopefully his already sparse player base doesn't dwindle too quickly, as Lemnis Gate follows through on his excellent concept.",,,,,,,"Lemnis Gate firing on all cylinders can be a delightfully cerebral experience, its time loop concept and diverse character roster paving the way for some truly spectacular moment-to-moment gameplay. It’s just a pity then that at launch, the majority of the player base, at least outside of the higher ranks, seem unwilling to embrace the whacky concept. Given time, though, once a core of dedicated fans develops, Lemnis Gate has the potential to provide a truly novel alternative take on the hero shooter genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lemnis Gate players will find that the hours disappear when they're playing it. It's addictive, impossible to put down, and could be the sleeper hit of the year if it finds its audience. And with Lemnis Gate available on Xbox Game Pass, it should have no problem doing just that.",,,,,,,,"Lemnis Gate brings a lot of innovation to the table, surpassing its time travel rival to present a strategic FPS that's well worth some attention. While held back by a lack of modes outside of online multiplayer and an outdated presentation, launching on the hugely successful Xbox Game Pass service makes the game palatable to those with an existing subscription. Whether it's jumping into an online lobby or gathering a group of friends for private matchmaking, there's nothing else quite like Lemnis Gate on console, and it's well worth a look for anyone who wants to see one possible future of the FPS genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-quarry,,,,,There’s a fairly big chunk of gameplay on offer in The Quarry and it totally deserves a replay in order for you to witness different endings and try to see if you can keep everyone alive - or kill them all.,,"The Quarry is a stylish homage to the classic horror slasher films that so terrified us on those summer nights, delighting any fan of this sub-genre through an intense interactive cinematic experience.",,,,,Supermassive’s The Quarry is a classic channelling of the same 80’s-era slasher/creature-feature appeal that made Until Dawn a success that players will still want to revisit multiple times.,"The Quarry is undoubtedly the best work yet by Supermassive Games, both in terms of gameplay and of plot ramifications and technical department. An enthralling experience that knows how to keep the fans of the genre happy, even if it suffers from a not so bold plot (especially on the horror side) and the temporary absence of an online multiplayer component. Yet, it's a title that every fan should consider for their collection.","The Quarry pays homage to the slasher genre with more than just a spiritual successor to Until Dawn. Supermassive's new game follows the foundations laid by the 2015 title offering a continuist but equally fun game full of familiar faces, gore and shocking moments. An experience not to be missed by any fan of the genre.",,,"Wearing its VHS horror influences on its sleeve, The Quarry is an engaging and immensely entertaining choice-driven adventure with a killer cast and a fun, knowingly silly storyline.",,"The Quarry is a fantastic adventure title as well as a cinematic marvel. It'll make you jump and squeel as you uncover the mysteries of Hacketts Quarry. With excellent QTEs and brilliant characters, you'll love every second of this creepy title.",,"This game is such a tribute to a beloved genre that it even contains rules that will help you to survive (if you bother to learn them.) It may not be the cheapest but it sure is an experience to enjoy. Having Jason’s ‘kill, kill, kill’ motif echoing around your head as you play it is not a prerequisite but it sure is fun.",,"The Quarry is a fantastic return to form for Supermassive Games. Every character stands out well on their own thanks to the fun and excellent writing. The monsters and villains, while not terrifying, are a very cool take on the Summer Camp Horror stories that we’ve seen time and again up until now. With just a little more refinement on the rough edges, there’s no doubt this game would’ve been a top 10 horror game. Even then, The Quarry is memorable, and I highly suggest you check it out, especially with a group of friends.",,,,"The Quarry isn't perfect due to some technical flaws and quick time events that are too easy. Nevertheless, The Quarry is a joy to play thanks to a great story and a fantastic cast of characters. This is a must-play for everyone that enjoys a good horror story.",,,,"The Quarry is to video games what most slashers of the ’90s are to movies: a guilty pleasure in dire need of a breath of fresh air. Despite it all, playing the latest title from Supermassive Games is bonkers if you get its numerous references and dismiss an uneven rhythm and some pointless gameplay phases. Fortunately, its story, its characters and above all its charming aesthetic are enough to keep you around for a while.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Quarry joins Until Dawn on the shelf of must-have terror/horror games. If you are a fan of the genre, this is the one you have to play at least once, since repeating it can become extremely boring, given that the story is told slowly and the interaction with the characters reveals little about the relationship between them. Even with some bugs, The Quarry offers a strong horror experience that can surprise even the strongest stomachs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aside from the small issues I had, one of which made me upset, I still enjoyed my time with the game. So much that I played halfway through it, stopped, convinced my wife to join me since she liked Until Dawn, and then played through it again. Oh, and my wife and I are wanting to play through it again to try out the opposite decisions. I still find Until Dawn an overall better experience, but The Quarry is a fun time especially with some friends arguing what we need to do in a situation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, this game is my new favorite game by Supermassive Games. It’s just as long as Until Dawn and it has even more branching paths in its story. Definitely pick up this game if you’re fan of games like Until Dawn or Dark Pictures Anthology!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Where the similarly ambitious Until Dawn felt relatively seamless, The Quarry often feels as if it’s bitten off more than it can chew.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
road-96,"The team of around 15 developers created a 15-20 hour game that is heavily influenced by the works of Tarantino, the Coen Brothers and Bong Joon-Ho and inspired by many stories, including The Goonies. Although unlikely, I would very much like some extra content featuring the loveable bumbling team of Stan and Mitch. While the game fell a bit short of it’s promises of your outcomes drastically being different because of your choices, it really doesn’t matter. You could strip away all the decision making, and you’d still have a gripping and intense story that you struggle to put down.",,,"Road 96 is a masterpiece in storytelling and depending on your own experience, you may even be moved by its through line of hope, loss, and the ultimate goal of personal freedom. Many of the game's themes haven't directly applied to my life, but Road 96 is an education in empathy and it really makes you feel for the folks out there who are scrambling to get their lives in order because of other people's actions. It's not a perfect game — mechanically things could be improved at times — but its story is about as close to perfect as you could ask for, and for that, we recommend it without a shadow of a doubt.","We didn’t realise how much we’d missed the episodic story framework of a Telltale game, and Road 96 – while not being from Telltale – is a long-lost cousin to it.",,"Road 96 takes us to a country ruled by a totalitarian dictator. While you run looking for a better life, you will try to change Petria’s fate with your decisions. A title that is definitely worth playing.",,,,,,"Apart from being an excellent first-person adventure, Road 96 is an overwhelming experience and an emotional dive into the '90s, with their music and style. As you stand on the side of the road, fantasizing about a better future, you'll wish that journey never ends.","Road 96 is a very good game, with side characters that become the main characters. The way the story is told through a character who is a ""spectator"" but whose decisions influence the world and those around him is a wise move.",,,,,"I wasn’t expecting to enjoy Road 96 as much as I did. I thought it would be slower and more disconnected. Instead, I experienced a rewarding and deep title where my choices mattered.",,"Road 96 is fun to play, a challenge, and also makes you question your political beliefs. Play this game, help others and always vote against fascism.",,,,"While many of your actions are said to have an impact on the game, in practice, that impact is fairly minimal. It all comes together in an ending that also feels far too convenient, not seriously reckoning with much of the themes the Road 96 brings up. In the end, it feels like Road 96 doesn’t have nearly as much to say about these topics as it thinks it does. It sticks the landing when it comes to its individual characters, but much less so regarding the overarching plot. Still, those character stories are engaging, the mini-games you’re thrown into are consistently fun, and Road 96 looks and sounds great. It all makes for a trip that’s worth taking, as long as you know what to expect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's a shame that Road 96's great character writing is stuck within such restrictive framing, even if many of its most memorable dialogue sequences only work given that the premise has allowed for this assortment of personalities to intertwine. It doesn't mean that there's no reward for seeing some of them through, but if you're hoping for an introspective look at the complexities of revolting against an oppressive regime, then Road 96 doesn't deliver on that front. It is, however, an enjoyable point-and-click adventure outside of that, with a neat procedural twist that keeps each of your escape attempts entertaining, with dialogue choices that feel purposeful and entertaining minigames to keep things varied.",,,,,,,,,,,"Road 96’s narrative may not reach the heights of the best the modern adventure genre has to offer, but it cleverly distracts with a cast of intriguing characters and the promise of procedurally generated road-trips. The novel concept doesn’t always work, but when it does, it offers a very personal and gripping journey through a country on the verge of dictatorship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
football-manager-2021,,"The experience of playing Football Manager on my living room TV really makes a difference – the whole thing feels more premium. I will always be a full-fat version of the game kinda guy, but that doesn’t take away from the fact the Sports Interactive have done a great job at making a Football Manager sim accessible to people who don’t want to search the Ecuadorean 3rd division to find the next wonder kid. One of the features that has really impressed me with the Xbox version is the quick resume feature, no waiting on loading screens just to grab a couple of games before dinner or heading off to work means that it really can be a pick up and play experience.",,"Ultimately then, you're going to need a little bit of patience with Football Manager 2021: Xbox Edition, whether you're brand-new to the series or a PC player looking to transition to console, but once you've spent a few hours with it, the control scheme becomes easier to wield. After that, you're free to enjoy the best sports management sim on Xbox by a country mile, and a game that football fans owe it to themselves to try at least once, especially now that it's available on Xbox Game Pass. Watch out, you might get hooked.","Football Manager 2021 Xbox Edition is a very good management sim and a viable option for anyone who spends more time on an Xbox than a PC. Performance-wise it runs well on the Series X and the whole layout is brilliantly designed from a visual standpoint. Unfortunately, it’s a pain to navigate the menus and even after sinking a ton of hours in, it still feels odd. The inclusion of microtransactions leaves a bitter taste too, because they’re just unnecessary.",,Football Manager 2021 is still the undisputed king of the soccer management sim. It's great to have it on consoles.,,,,,,"Football Manager 2021 Xbox Edition is a great management sim, with a very high customization level, a huge database and a very effective porting to console controls. Definitely, a must-have for any real football lover.","Football Manager 2021 Xbox Edition is a fantastic option for the most conscientious football fans. Despite the absence of some features, its only big problem is its poor playability with a controller.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Football Manager on Xbox is an acceptable alternative if we are reluctant to use our PC as a platform to play. However, control lapses, hindering the experience and making it less enjoyable. The hours of browsing through the menus that we loved become a process that we try to avoid as much as possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Although Football Manager 21 isn’t as in-depth on Xbox Series X as it is on PC, it manages to provide a fun and engaging management simulator that has been sorely missing from consoles for some time.","It may not be perfect, with a control scheme that’s functional but still a little too clunky, and it’s almost impossible to recommend to anyone who owns a capable PC. However, if you only own an Xbox, all of the main features are there, the match engine is better than ever and it’s a great title to dip in and out of for 30 minutes at a time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fifa-22,,,,"We're pleasantly surprised by FIFA 22 on Xbox Series X. The franchise had a good first outing on next-gen consoles last year, but the gameplay has really been taken up a notch this time around, seemingly proving that ""Hypermotion Technology"" isn't just another throwaway buzzword. It's not perfect, and there are certain areas off the pitch that we wish could have received even more attention, but this is the best FIFA has been in quite a few years, and we just hope it isn't ruined by unnecessary gameplay patches down the line.","With the inclusion of HyperMotion technology, FIFA 22 on Xbox Series X|S is in the best shape it has been for years. HyperMotion may sound very buzz-wordy – and it is – but it also fundamentally changes the action on the pitch into something very much resembling real-life football. Tweaks and changes will be made as the season progresses but right now, this is one of the best launches a FIFA game has ever had.",,"FIFA 22 is a clear step forward in the franchise, thanks mainly to the arrival of much-needed changes. It still misses a generational leap, but it is undoubtedly a great football game.",,,"FIFA 22 adds some big improvements to the way the game functions, and better yet, makes the game feel even better as you play. Add to that some big changes to modes like Career Mode, and FIFA 22 is a huge improvement from past entries.",,,"FIFA 22 introduces welcome new features such as the Hypermotion technology, a more balanced gameplay and improvements in several modes, but it fails to get rid of some historical flaws that now clash more with the improvements received. The result is, as always, a football title of the highest caliber, both on the technical front and in terms of pure fun, but we start to feel the need for a more marked change of pace to really push the saga into the new generation.","FIFA 22 is a further leap towards realism in soccer titles. The inclusion of Hypermotion not only improves the staging of the game, but also translates to the field. In addition, improvements in ball physics and additions to the different game modes make FIFA 22 a more satisfying game than the previous title in the series.","On the whole, though, the value for money here is ludicrous and every mode provides a different slice of footballing simulation goodness. Beyond all that, though: FIFA 22 is just a fun time! The game will change with patches eventually, but right now it is the best launch FIFA has ever been. It leaves you with a smile at every small touch and with a satisfied feeling and you ping a cross-field ball. FIFA has finally brought it home!",,"FIFA 22 offers a slower, more deliberate game of football on the pitch, and that's a good thing. But with minimal investment in new modes or updates to existing ones, this is a good upgrade, rather than an essential one.","The gameplay has therefore managed to take the train of the new generation while the content of FIFA 22, far from the references of the sports genre, is still blocked in the 2010s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Without much surprise, FIFA 22 is unfortunately the logical continuation of all its predecessors. For its first real opus dedicated to new generation consoles, EA doesn’t manage (and doesn’t want) to fix the repetitive flaws that have plagued its franchise for years and chooses instead to improve the gameplay and atmosphere which are major, but secondary aspects. Even graphically, the evolution remains insignificant and it leaves a sour taste. For FIFA fans, the 22nd episode should, however, be a satisfying vintage subject to a patch that could change everything. For lovers of simulation and real football, it’s best to heed the advice of the legendary Gary Lineker: “FIFA is a simple game: 22 clowns dribble with a ball for 90 minutes and in the end, football still manages to be the real loser.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,"FIFA 22 makes some important changes on and off the pitch, and though there's still plenty of room for improvement, it's still the series' best game in recent years.","FIFA 22 offers the franchise an exciting start to life on Xbox Series X|S and PS5, with drastically improved gameplay. Complementary features aside in Career, Pro Clubs, and Ultimate Team, that was the dealbreaker and with Hypermotion Technology, EA Sports has delivered.","FIFA 22 is just like any other FIFA game. It’s a very, very good football game, and with NBA 2K taking its eyes off the prize in favour of the State Farm drip, it’s left with a tap-in to be 2021’s best sports sim. HyperMotion makes a difference, create-a-club adds some personality, and everything else is the same. What more were you expecting?",,,,"FIFA 22 is the best in the series to date, even if its revamped animation isn't as revolutionary as billed. As a standalone title it's fantastic, even though avid players will likely feel that changes are negligible compared to last year.",,,,,,,,,,"FIFA 22 might tout next-gen visuals and solid gameplay, but there aren't enough exciting changes to differentiate it from last year's experience.",,"FIFA 22 evolved its engine and its core game modes, but the feeling on the pitch is almost the same. The gameplay is very attack-oriented and fast: FIFA fans are going to love it, football fans, maybe, would love to slow it down and try a more tactical experience.",,,,,FIFA 22 improves things where they were needed and is the first actual next-gen FIFA.,,,,"Fifa 22 for the new generation of consoles is a big step forward for both the series and Electronic Arts. The realism is more noticeable this time, while the ball game on the field is more convincing. Sure, there are occasional misses in places, but for the most part, everything from animations to collisions feels completely worthy of the epithet ""next generation"".",,,,,,,"FIFA 22 incorporates enough novelties in its game system to vary the rhythm of the matches and improve the experience. A great simulator, punctuated by the importance of microtransactions and the absence of major developments in its different modalities.",,,,,,,,"Although it has its shortcomings, I’ve been really impressed with FIFA 22. EA has delivered one of the most in-depth career modes to date, and the new additions across the game’s other modes are most welcome. I do hope to see more iteration across the board, but the gameplay this year feels top notch. It’s a huge step forward for the series, and a proper showcase of what the new consoles are capable of.","Overall, FIFA 22 is more or less what you'd expect from the latest title in such a series. In some areas it impresses, while in others it falls short. The visuals look better than ever and the accessibility options are relatively varied, but the imagery doesn't always hold up and the removal of the single-player mode 'The Journey' seems like a misstep from the developers. While it may not feel as innovative as previous instalments, FIFA 22 is still a worthy sports game that scratches your football itch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fifa 22 struggles with a massive identity-crisis. Does it want to be a realistic football simulation or as spectacular as possible? The result is rather disappointing. A soulless football game in which every game feels like a match for the Johan Cruijff cup: you can win it, but it really isn't about anything at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It feels strange to have to say this, but FIFA 22 is a sports game made with love, whose developers have obviously rediscovered the joy behind how a football sim should behave. The changes to gameplay and graphics, and the evolutions of established modes, give it the largest scope yet for a football sim - perhaps any sports game, ever. And it pays off. FIFA 22 is the most streamlined, self-aware and ultimately enjoyable FIFA title in years and makes a strong case for being its altogether best entry. It's just about the shakeup that the fans have been asking for for a long time, and it's a pleasure to say it's well worth playing for the next year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
outriders-worldslayer,,,,,"For long-time fans of Outriders, the introduction of Worldslayer is good news, with new stuff to go and hunt and new levels to play around with. It is short, but it’s still enjoyable",,A great way to keep playing a really good looter shooter.,,,,,"Outriders Worldslayer is a great time for fans of the base game with a dedicated squad of friends to play with, but players looking for a single player experience, or something more than ‘just Outriders’ will have a rough time.",,"Worldslayer takes all the good things from Outriders and tweaks and improves them. If you like frenetic action, brutal confrontation, being a destruction machine, then this is the time to go for Outriders. I think the main flaws of this game are its flat story and maybe the new ascension skill tree that gets boring because it has so little short term impact. And among the best is the new endgame content: the test of Tarya Gratar.",,,,"Outriders Wordslayer is definitely the expansion that fans of Square Enix's Looter-Shooter have been waiting for. Without ever revolutionizing either the game or the genre, this DLC is extremely generous in content and offers enough new features to encourage players to return to the planet Enoch. People Can Fly refines its title in its own way and spices up a desired nervous and gratifying adventure.",,,"Outriders: Worldslayer is a solid 8 or so hour expansion that adds a seemingly long and quite enjoyable endgame grind to what was already a solid title. With the base game on Game Pass, it is worth giving that a shot and if you like it just know that this expansion is available, and it’s damned good. It takes everything the main campaign has and dials it up to eleven in a brilliantly dumb-fun kinda way.",,"Outriders Worldslayer, while introducing some fun new additions, just ended up being more Outriders for better or worse…There is no revolutionary overhaul of systems. They built on what was already there or just retooled to fit in theming-wise (looking at you, Apocalypse levels). One thing is for sure—People Can Fly can make a fun game even more fun, regardless of whether it ends up being good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Outriders Worldslayer adds a campaign, new scenarios, equipment and another endgame and pushes the original game at its best, both in terms of narrative and gameplay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Outriders: Worldslayer is by and large a more complete game than its original release. The story and villain feel much more menacing, the new Pax systems allows more depth in character development and the new armor sets and weapons ensure that players are going to have new stuff to chase. All that good is still hampered in my opinion by a lack of world building and lore, the planet Enoch is framed as a dangerous and uncharted world and at times it can feel that way. But I’d love to learn more about the civilizations of the past, more about what happened to Earth; all of this can come with a sequel but as I said before they must sell enough to get there. And while I think that Worldslayer is a step in the right direction, I just don’t know if its going to be enough to keep people playing in the long term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
goat-simulator-3,,,,,"Goat Simulator 3 isn’t perfect, feeling rough and ready as you play. But this is what Goat Simulator has always been. With my cynical head on, it does feel a bit artificial this time, like the team of developers have tried to introduce bugs and glitches.",,"GOAT Simulator 3 takes its humor and action a point further than in the original game, with a criticism of the sandbox of which it ends up being a prisoner and falls into the usual mistakes. All accompanied by a crazy action, unlikely utensils and a lot of humor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Goat Simulator 3 is a truly amusing an enjoyable experience from start to finish.,,,,,"Goat Simulator 3 raises the baaa-r on every level (I can’t help myself, I’ve been playing it for too long and the goat puns have taken over). Everything is bigger and better. A larger open world, more customisation, more to unlock and do, we’ve finally got online multiplayer with fun minigames, and there’s just more overall general goaty goodness. Though you might encounter the odd glitch or two, it doesn’t detract from the gameplay, and you’ll brush it off as easily as your ragdoll goat getting back to its feet after crash-landing from the top of a never-ending beanstalk. Even if you’ve never been tempted by it before, I can’t emphasise enough how strangely satisfying it is to unleash hell in goat form on an unsuspecting city.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Goat Simulator 3 is a remarkable improvement on the original in practically every way, with a great variety of gear to wreak havoc with. While the attempt to introduce a story mode is satisfactory at best, the dedication to offering fun and robust multiplayer modes easily elevates Goat Simulator 3 to be greater than the sum of its parts.",,"Bigger, badder, better: Goat Simulator 3 is a very fun open world game with a surprisingly intriguing multiplayer mode. If you want to discover every single one of its secrets, you'll have to play for many... many hours.",,"Goat Simulator 3 makes no prisoners and comes out as a fun and non-stop parody of modern open world games.

The real surprise is that, beneath Goat Sim‘s daft facade, there are some brilliant gags that manage to go beyond being throwaway Easter eggs.

wwe-2k22,"Over the years I have been such a fan of the WWE and everything they have brought to their fans, I have played many versions of their videogames, and up to this point I have enjoyed, but not really loved, to continue going back to the older games as I get discouraged by the more previous iterations. But all hail the WWE 2K22, because I do believe that this is the best version we have ever seen so far. I hope that 2K continue on this path of improvement and continue to blow my mind further every year with as many improvements as this had. The control system and playability have become more easily understood and better controlled overall, which I found to be a big bonus because I often get discouraged from playing if it doesn't have a well laid out and easy to understand button layout.",WWE 2K22 is the comeback that the series needed to put itself back on everyone’s radar once again. The game’s amazing presentation and fluid gameplay are exactly what the doctor ordered to make such a solid and enjoyable experience. 2K delivered on all of their promises making WWE 2K22 a instalment that “Hits Different”.,,"WWE 2K22 isn't going to surpass the likes of ""No Mercy"" and ""Here Comes The Pain"" in terms of fan favourite wrestling games, but in our opinion, it's the best WWE 2K game to date. The gameplay is improved, the graphics are improved, and there's enough content here to keep you busy for a long time, even if some of the new modes haven't quite reached their potential yet. There are still some unwanted series staples here, such as clunky collision detection, but for the most part it's obvious how much progress has been made across the board over the past couple of years, and it's now up to 2K to take things to the next level with WWE 2K23.","WWE 2K22 hits different. It hits way better than the last outing and only the game modes really hold it back from being considered a main event masterpiece. If you love wrestling, you should contemplate stepping into the squared circle with WWE 2K22.",,"WWE 2K22 brings a beloved franchise to the top. An amazing roster of superstars, outstanding modes and a promise fulfilled by 2K. It really “hits different.”",,,"WWE 2K22 adds some big improvements to core functions like gameplay and combat, while also introducing new modes like MyGM that make the game feel much fresher. Add to that a big graphical overhaul, and WWE 2K22 is a major step forward for this franchise.",,"WWE 2K22 is a step in the right direction, with a lot of content and a lot of fun to be had. A far from perfect title loaded with nostalgia, and too many game modes can be overwhelming. An easy recommend for wrestling fans, and newcomers.","WWE 2K22 brings new life and dignity to a beloved franchise, letting us forget the previous episode's misstep. The new graphics engine, the almost fully recreated gameplay, the richness of the offer and the general atmosphere that is felt in the game, overshadow the small imperfections still needing work to be done. Visual Concepts deserves our applause as a studio finally worthy of bringing forth the future of WWE's franchise.","WWE 2K22 brings all the passion and adrenaline of wrestling, in a format that, although it is fair in terms of graphics, stands out for its renewed gameplay, enhancing its mechanics and positioning itself as the best in the franchise.",,,"After the disastrous launch of WWE 2K20, 2K and Visual Concepts really faced something of a turning point, an uphill struggle, and after a lengthy hiatus, WWE 2K22 emerges as the best entry in the series for years. As per the game's tagline, it really does 'hit different'.","If it hasn't drastically changed its gameplay, WWE 2K22 is almost a reboot in its visual rendering and with the incorporation of the My MG mode. The latter is a good surprise, leads us to manage a stable of stars and a schedule of shows without being too complex, a successful bet. Technically, the latest generation of consoles holds its own and avoids the pitfall of WWE 2K20's many bugs, even if some loading times are long. In short, if this last opus could have been deeper in terms of staging, it delights in its lifespan thanks to an XXL roster, realistic in the animations without being polluted by the less vital virtual currency than in NBA 2K. A spectacular and versatile title, like the cover star Rey Mysterio.","WWE 2K22 is a wonderful addition to the franchise. With a vast array of gameplay options, excellent graphics, and an in-depth customisation section, there is something for everyone. Sadly, there are still issues but most will amuse you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite these minor glitching and bug issues, WWE 2K22 offers up an enjoyable experience for players to delight in. With improved gameplay and game modes, the recent 2K wrestling title marks a return to form for the franchise.",,,,,,,"WWE 2K22 is the comeback fans of the series have been hoping for. While it still won't trouble WWF No Mercy for the 'best WWE game' title, it's the first time in many years that the series has delivered both in and out of the ring.",,,,,,,,,"When I was young, my parents told me that patience is a virtue: I never believed them. WWE 2K22 taught me that was true. The two years hiatus gave Visual Concepts the time to make things right, tuning all the parts of the game that weren’t good enough in the past. You can always do better, so some aspects (like the MyGM game mode) could be improved, but WWE 2K22 feels like a fresh new start.",,,"WWE 2K22 delivers an improved, more refined experience than the previous episodes, while offering a huge roster and excellent graphics for most of the superstars. When it comes to game modes, however, the game feels cumbersome and outdated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A remarkable comeback for the franchise, with a redesigned game engine and control overhaul making for a very entertaining experience.",,,,,,,"From Showcase to MyGM, WWE 2K22 is stuffed with content, and in terms of graphics and polish, it's a huge improvement over its predecessors. But the game has some notable drawbacks, especially with the botched MyGM, which could have been the crown jewel of WWE 2K22's game modes. The foundation is there for a future WWE game to provide a more fleshed-out MyGM experience, so hopefully, it isn't abandoned again.",,,,,"This is a great comeback for WEE2K, after more than a few missteps. Now we want more, just like 2K is doing for the NBA (but while keeping it light on the microtransaction side).",,,,,,,,,,"After a poor last effort, WWE 2K22 brings the long-running wrestling franchise back in a big way, proving that the extra development time is just what the doctor ordered. It successfully streamlines its in-ring action so that it’s more adaptable to players of different skill levels, removing archaic systems that previously bogged it down. Animations and presentation are top notch, and there really is a game mode for everybody, with a lot of variety. While not all the modes deserve to main event when you dissect them in detail, there’s still a very strong foundation to build from; the bottom line is that WWE 2K22 is the best wrestling game in over a decade.",,,,,,"WWE 2K22 is a massive step up in quality for the troubled wrestling franchise. The gameplay engine is in great shape, and the mode quality is mostly solid. While there are improvements to be made going forward, I'm no longer totally hopeless about the future of the series.",,,,,"WWE 2K22 is a robust wrestling simulator that gets the series back on track after its nearly career-ending 2020 installment. It’s filled with modes, impressive combat tweaks, and a truly phenomenal creative suite that turn it into a hoss of a game. There’s still work to do if 2K Sports wants to fully rehabilitate the series. Multi-man matches need a rework, its more promising modes need to be expanded, and there’s still plenty of gunk to clean up. But if this is how much an annualized series can turn itself around by taking one year off, then every franchise like it should consider an offseason.",,,"With all the extra time between 2K20 and this entry, I expected several things. I expected the roster to be out of date, and it is. Many of the 180+ wrestlers featured here are no longer with the WWE (although that’s more WWE’s fault than 2k’s). I expected many of the wrestler characterizations and storylines to also be out of date, and they are (for example, Seth Rollins is still operating under his “Messiah” character). Most importantly I expected some big improvements, and while some of the items here definitely meet that qualification the game is still stuck in a rut with respect to AI and physics/clipping issues. There’s talk that WWE may look to partner with EA on future games, so this may be the last go around for the team at 2K, but if it’s not I hope that their focus for WWE 2k23 will be on fixing some of these issues so that the solid base they’ve built can actually live up to its potential. Hopefully I’m not revisiting that sentence again next year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WWE 2K22 certainly hits different, go check the score again, it certainly has not come out a perfect ten. The redeemable qualities, thankfully, are the wrestling mechanics themselves, which ironically might not be everyone's cup of tea, and MyRISE mode which offers a good amount of content to keep the average WWE gamer going. It has taken over 2 years for the game to finally release and while it is an improvement on WWE 2K20 it still serves up disappointment in other ways, such as an outdated roster, a pathetic attempt at recreating General Manager mode, and a disgusting ethical issue of microtransactions in MyFACTION mode, albeit optional. MyFACTION mode is enjoyable, and can be played without using real-world money to progress, but the fact of the matter is that this mechanic should not exist in a full priced game. If you came to play then there is certainly a price to pay.",,,,,WWE 2K22 hits different and it might just bruise your face if you give it that same evil eye that you gave 2K20 since its far better.,,,,,"Though not a flawless reinvention, WWE 2K22 is a monumentally large step in the right direction for the series.",,,,,,"WWE 2K22 is an entry wrestling fans cannot miss. It has everything you can expect from WWE; from an enhanced look, a better and easier to remember control scheme, to a solid variety of modes where MyGM is the crowning jewel. WWE 2K22 is a foundation for the future of the franchise, and a far cry from the disaster of 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haven,,"If you take one thing away from this review, be it this; playing Haven is utterly mesmerising, a wonderfully written and performed tale of two lovers taking a chance on each other even at the cost of their very way of life. Yu and Kay have become two of my favourite characters this year, and even now I can’t help wonder where they will go next. Exploring Source is an exercise if joy, even when we have to repeat sections a few times, and there always feels like there is something else to find or see. It could have been a tad shorter, but when what’s here is this enjoyable I’ll allow it!",,,"Losing yourself in Haven on the Xbox is a sedate joy. You can wile away hours, clearing Rust from the world and pocketing alien produce. Then it’s back to the Nest for a night’s kip and one of the more endearing romantic relationships in video games. But as you skim across the surface of the Source, you’ll be left wishing that Haven could have trusted you a little more, and let you dive deeper into its shallow systems. It may not quite reach the heights of its inspirations, then, but Haven is an alien holiday that might just blow your troubles away.",,,,"Haven is an uplifting and positive tale of a young couple setting out to make an alien planet their home. Yu and Kay are a likeable pair as you watch their relationship strengthen, the world of Source is a gorgeous place to explore, and the soundtrack is great as well. While the overarching story could be deeper and battles could be streamlined further, Haven is a game that offers a chilled out escape.",,,,"Haven tells a tale of love and freedom in an intriguing alien world, beautifully depicted and sided by a great electro soundtrack. A game to try, even if you'll need some patience to move past the first, too slow, couple of hours.",,,,,"A charming surprise and should mark the genre of adventure game thanks to the quality of the writing, the few mechanics borrowed from RPGs, the possibility of playing as a duo and its accessibility.",,"Even if it fails to depict the different aspects of and mature love story, Haven has undoubted qualities and its artistic side will make a wide range of players fall in love.",,,,"Haven is the rare game that excels at making its characters seem believable and human, especially when it gives them nothing more to do than just being themselves. The end result may feel a little familiar for anyone who’s lived through the past year, but that doesn’t make the game any less worthwhile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Haven is a special game that is hard to recommend, but hard to miss. If you want a good honest look at star crossed lovers, and you have someone to play it with, definitely consider dropping some time into this lovely world.",,,"What Haven doesn’t quite perfect in its gameplay, it makes up for with a beautifully crafted, surprisingly human relationship, accompanied by a brilliant soundtrack and gorgeous presentation.",,"Part of me wants to say Haven is my game of the year, but I should probably let the post-play buzz die down first. What I do know is that Yu and Kay will stick with me for a long time.",,,,,"Travelling around Source is a pleasant and chilled experience, if a little bland at times.",,,,,,,"At the end of the twenty hours required to complete it, Haven is confirmed as an intimate and daily love story, which rejects the pomposity of the epic to settle on the sweetness of adolescence. And it's a rarity in the gaming world.",,"Even when I was frustrated, I was impressed by the touching and thrilling moments Haven creates. I enjoyed the genuine connection between Yu and Kay, and jetting off into the unknown with a pair of hover-boots is a blast. But this otherworldly adventure extends itself too far beyond its strengths. Sometimes the rough patches are worth working through, but like any relationship, sometimes you’re just giving more than you’re getting.",,,,,,,,,,"Despite its technical hangups, Haven has passion and charisma to spare thanks to some clever writing and an honest portrayal of a devoted relationship. There are rough patches when you get stuck on confusing terrain or come up against a temperamental adversary, but the journey is mostly as difficult as you want to make it. Keeping these wanderers together is a pleasant challenge, and re-assembling the puzzle pieces of their past has a satisfying payoff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The endearing love story and vibrant art style of Haven can't save it from being a derivative and forgettable RPG adventure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Along with being one of the most gentle and soothing games of the year, Haven is also gaming at its most compassionate.","This is my dilemma with Haven, then: as a chill-out RPG with a beautiful world to explore, it’s a pleasant experience that really helped me relax in the evenings after a rough day. But it has a story, a story with a real threat that is swept aside, and a central couple that, while sweet and believable, never grow beyond their typical “hot-headed girl” and “meticulous research boy” characteristics. Even as I was rebuilding my ship and growing plants, I didn’t feel like I’d gained anything or learnt anything new about the characters. If I were to return to Source, it would be to give my pet lizard Oink a little scratch on the chin, or to see the breeze blow through the grass and experience a brief moment of calm in this currently chaotic world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chorus,"Chorus is a fantastic space shooter that is woven together by a story that is great on paper but lacks proper execution. Its overall plot is very interesting, but the dialog and cutscenes didn’t do much to pull me in. That being said, Chorus is the most fun I’ve had in a very long time with a space shooter. With a packed holiday season, I found myself doing the impossible; I delayed playing more Halo Infinite and I died on purpose in Chorus to replay some sequences because they were that much fun. The abilities, the weapons, and the lightning-fast combat make it a joy to play. There is a lot to explore in the world, and I am hoping that this isn’t the last we’ve seen of Nara and Forsaken.","Deep Silver Fishlabs has spent a lot of time developing space-combat shooter games; they also developed the Galaxy on Fire series, and I think all of that time has culminated in a stand-out product here in Chorus. Taking the gameplay elements found in a typical 3D action RPG and applying them to a space flight game works tremendously well. Flying around the levels is a blast, the combat is enjoyable, and the story is more substantial than I expected, which was good and bad, as sometimes I wished the characters would shut up so I could get back into the action. If playing a space-combat shooter with an action RPG structure sounds at all interesting then you should consider checking out Chorus.",,,"The overwhelming majority of Chorus is hugely enjoyable. It’s a vast game, one that is fast and furious with a story that keeps pulling you along.",,"Chorus quickly hooks you with it’s fast and satisfying gameplay, but slows down like a truck by it’s third act, making the final hours a little bit of a chore.",,,,,,,"Chorus is one of the best space shooter today. A fun, attractive game that amazes you just by seeing and entering its world, but which falls short due to its repetitive missions and lack of additional elements.",,,"Chorus might ostensibly look like any other space shooter, but, discounting a few annoyances, it has some cool ideas of its own, and frenetic action that will pull you right in like a tractor beam.","Despite a few flaws, in particular with regard to the structure of the scenario, the excessive presence of dialogues, an insignificant soundtrack and framerate drops, Chorus is the nice surprise of the end of 2021.",,"Chorus is a fun and exciting videogame, with a particular gameplay. It’s a small surprise from a development studio passionate of the sci-fi genre.",,,,,"There’s a solid space shooter buried beneath Chorus’ many bumps and bruises. Unfortunately, however, I’m not sure many players will be willing to dig beyond its myriad technical issues and more frustrating moments to find it. And honestly, that’s a real shame. Because with a bit more polish and refinement, Fishlabs’ latest offering could have been a space opera to remember with its unique story and exciting blend of sci-fi action and creepy occult mysticism. If you’re willing to overlook its problems, Chorus offers about a dozen hours of dogfighting action to keep you busy. But you’re going to need plenty of patience if you hope to break the Circle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chorus has a slow start as it tries to set out its grand vision of a universe fighting mass indoctrination, while also reckoning with the very base of its power climb. That can make the early couple of hours feel pedestrian. Stick with it, though, and there's fun to be had in throwing enemy ships like paper airplanes and careening through the bellies of huge ships – even if the overall narrative feels largely forgettable.",,,"Chorus does an excellent job of cutting out the dull parts of space dogfighting, getting right to the flashy fun of blasting through enemy fighters and capital ships with superpowered abilities. Its large and pretty map is filled with fleshed-out side quests, and they’re varied enough that it’s easy to cruise around for a few dozen hours and really get the hang of the combat system. The story behind it all isn’t half bad once you’ve waded through a flood of sci-fi mysticism, and Nara and Forsaken are interesting characters to spend all that time with – which is a relief, because they’re the only ones we ever get to see.",Chorus is a joy from start to finish and I strongly implore that anyone who has ever enjoyed shooting things in a spaceship gives it a good hard look.,,,,,,,,,"Chorus is a half-successful product. The guys from Deep Silver Fishlabs have actually shaped a galvanizing combat system supported by gameplay mechanics that are well suited to the space combat shooter genre, but the exploratory component almost completely devoid of indications and the poor readability of the action penalize the playful system. If on the one hand we declare ourselves satisfied with the work done on the narrative front, there is still a long road that the Hamburg studio will have to travel to transform Chorus into the promised product. In short, the redemption of Nara cannot yet be said to be fully achieved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While Chorus lacks a more deft approach in telling its story, its gameplay more than makes up for it. The game provides a nice sandbox experience to explore a beautifully realised cosmos, with different-looking systems to explore to add some nice variety. Exploring this galaxy on its own could be enough in its own right, but space combat also offers an enjoyable and satisfying experience that controls superbly well. Chorus achieves where it counts and I feel there may be potential for this team to explore a sequel should they so choose. It offers a compelling enough world that could evoke stories that might matter more to the player, widening the potential for the game’s context to further emphasise the game’s truly stellar combat .",,,,"Somewhere in Chorus is a very cool game full of spectacular dogfights in space. To get there, the player has to sit through a lot of long-winded and sci-fi jargon-laden dialogues. Whoever gets through this will be presented with a fantastically playing space combat simulator that remains fun throughout the game with a load of special powers. But if the story had gone down a notch, the rest of the game would have come into its own.",,"At its best moments, Chorus is an intense space fighter that takes you to some gorgeous locations. However, the weak plot and technical issues hold it back from its full potential.","Chorus may just be the surprise hit of 2021 for anyone who loves space combat and a surprisingly deep and interesting sci-fi story with cosmic horror elements. Thanks to slick movement and a variety of fun powers, combat never gets old and remains challenging through the surprisingly long and varied campaign. This already great package is rounded off with great visuals and sound design as well as a solid technical performance throughout the game. The fast-paced combat may scare some less experienced players off, but for anyone who enjoys blowing up enemy ships at break-neck speeds, this is a very easy recommendation.",,,,,,,"I’m not going to lie; I LOVE everything about this game. In fact, the only thing I wish is that I was able to get out of the ship and walk around as Nara. Much like the Galaxy on Fire series all conversations happen in ship, unless it’s a cutscene. But even that is not really worth counting as a strike against the game because literally everything else is such a smooth experience. While the story can get a bit confusing, if players are fans of breakneck speeds, and thrilling dogfights in space then Chorus is going to be right up your alley. I cannot wait to see what Deep Silver Fishlabs can do with a sequel to this game or even some DLC, with the world that has been created here it really would be a shame to let it go to waste.",,,,,"The combat is the highlight, frantic and cinematic, but Chorus' open-world narrative ambitions let it down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pga-tour-2k23,"PGA Tour 2K23 may have skipped a year, and maybe that’s where my expectations were higher than they should have been, but there’s really not a massive upgrade from 2K21 overall.

However other general sports fans will feel left out due to the elitist vibe this game produces.,,,,,,"PGA Tour 2K23 convincingly delivers thanks to a revamped swing mechanic and improvements to the MyCareer mode, even if the impact of microtransactions is still heavy. It's nice to be able to use the real pros again, but the dearth of new courses is a bit disappointing. Still, it remains a recommended title for lovers of golf titles, both amateur and experienced ones.","PGA Tour 2K23 is everything a golf fan could expect from a golf game, but it's also much more than that. It is a game for all audiences. Demanding and versatile. Exciting and relaxed. An essential if you like sports video games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While it’s very true I have a soft spot in my heart for PGA Tour accordingly, there’s no denying 2K23 is solid. Small improvements to an existing formula mightn’t be looked highly upon in a yearly cycle, but PGA Tour 2K23 gets away with it because of its cadence. Welcome back, old friend. 3 click for life.","Fans of the sport will enjoy PGA Tour 2K23, even if it's a little rough around the edges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With retooled swing mechanics, including an inventive three-click system, PGA Tour 2K23's on-the-course golfing is the best yet, not just in the series, but in the history of the simulation golf genre. Mostly smart improvements to MyCareer mode make you feel more in control of your created golfer's trajectory–even if the new consumables have the slight potential to become pay-to-win. Finally being able to play as real pros again is a joy, but the minimal real-life course additions put a slight damper on the fun. Nevertheless, it's not lacking in content in the slightest thanks to the engaging Online Societies mode and the endless possibilities provided by user-created courses, many of which could be mistaken for layouts designed by well-known course architects. PGA Tour 2K23 continues the series tradition of being welcoming to new players while offering an authentic, challenging golfing experience for those who desire it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Probably with the addition of more translations, especially Spanish, it would have been reason enough to take into account the purchase of this game, but it has not been the case, so it remains off the radar of most players, thus remaining in oblivion as a game that Square Enix did not know how to take advantage of, remaining in non-existence in the mouths of the company's fans.",,,,"From the outset, we cannot welcome the bet launched by The Diofield Chronicle. Carried by divine music and gameplay as ingenious as it is interesting, the Square-Enix game is undeniably generous. Regulars of the genre and lovers of tactical role-playing games risk succumbing to its ""retro"" charm and its various incantations. Rhythmic, pleasant and more surprising than it seems, The Diofield Chronicle struggles to keep up the pace over time. The objectives are repeated, the free phases do not bring much and the staging lacks the energy to widen its audience. Nevertheless, for those who want to discover something other than the usual blockbusters and who is not hermetic to the genre, here is a work that could become cult in a few years or, at least, find its letters of nobility among enthusiasts.",,,"The DioField Chronicle is a great real-time strategy game for consoles. It controls well, the stages aren’t too long, and there’s enough mechanical depth to make stage replays interesting. Although I couldn’t be bothered with the game’s story, the scenes themselves don’t last long and all of it can be skipped at any point.

in-sound-mind,,"Now, as I mentioned briefly at the start, the trailer didn’t quite sell to me the whole psychological horror tag that has been applied to In Sound Mind, and even now after having spent some enjoyable hours running through it, I wouldn’t quite point fully towards the horror genre for placement with In Sound Mind. Sure it has a few horror elements, however, should you be willing to accept it as a psychological thriller, then I for one would certainly assign that as amended tag, whilst also raising the expectation that In Sound Mind is a game we’ll likely see mentioned in the same breath as previously mentioned classic Condemned, in years to come.",,,"In Sound Mind hears what a lot of horror fans have been saying for some time. Horror does not have to be jump scares. It doesn’t have to be Chris Redfield lock-and-loading incendiary rounds.

The gameplay, while simple, only engages in the last part of the experience.

We Create Stuff's work has so much personality and so many beautiful ideas, and offers to the player an intelligent and fun experience.

But the experience as a whole far outweighs the mistakes made along the way.",,,,,,,I think the biggest standout is the atmosphere. For a game that has nearly cartoony visuals and NO gore at all (this game is rated T) it still hit those tension marks I would expect from a good horror game.

wild-hearts,,,,"If you’re hungry for a new hunter-style experience that isn't Capcom's premier franchise, Wild Hearts is probably as good as it’s going to get right now. It's perhaps an easier entry point with fewer things to overwhelm newcomers and has plenty of fun moments for sure. For veteran hunters, it does bring some new ideas to the table – especially with the building mechanics, but it might not necessarily meet your expectations in other areas of gameplay, and can be rough around the edges at times. If Wild Hearts does have a future beyond this (and there's DLC on the way, we should mention) it would be nice to see it form its own proper identity.","WILD HEARTS is one for both fresh faces and hardened veterans, and should be seen as the first legitimate threat to Monster Hunter’s unopposed reign at the top.",,"Wild Hearts will not surprise you with its graphics, but it will do so for its combat system and its ability to stay glued to the screen either playing alone or playing cooperatively.",,,"It is a shame that Wild Hearts launched in the state it is in. The gameplay loop of hunting monsters and using their parts to create gear is addictive, the weapons are entertaining to use, the Karakuri system is deep and filled with secrets, and the world of Azuma is beautiful and immersive. Yet the horrendous optimization issues bring down the experience and, in worst cases, render the game unplayable on certain platforms.",,Wild Hearts expands on a tried and true formula with its own blend of mechanics that make it a must for fans of big game hunting and gamers who like co-op.,"Wild Hearts is a hunter-like game that is both respectful of tradition and at the same time very brave, thanks to innovations such as the Karakuri structure system and greater attention to the narrative. In addition, the game benefits from the care taken in designing the Kemono monsters and crafting an experience that will satisfy both genre veterans and newcomers. Despite a few youth issues, it is undoubtedly one of the best alternatives around for fans of the genre.","Wild Hearts is a solid and fun title that can be more entertaining with a couple of friends, since you can hunt in groups of three players. Its deep combat building mechanics bring a fresh approach to hunting games.",,,"While having to hunt monsters driven from their habitat by human intervention and a lack of food engenders a sense of Shadow of the Colossus-level guilt, there's no avoiding the sheer depth and consistent enjoyment that Wild Hearts has to offer.","Without revolutionizing the genre, Wild Hearts offers a direct approach to the game of hunting. With the mechanics of the Karakuris, the fights take advantage of a strategic dimension thanks to these constructions that are effective both against monsters and to adjust the levels in its own way. Far from forgetting the essential, the experience of Omega Force offers a nervous and dynamic gameplay, characteristic of the studio, supported by a limited, but varied arsenal.",,,"I’m stunned. It is an incredible first effort from the team at Omega Force. Mixing Monster Hunting with Green Lantern crafting works beautifully. I hope this series is around for a very long time, because this game is excellent.",,,"As it stands, my early hours in Wild Hearts have definitely been enjoyable. Performance had some hiccups prior to the day one patch, which seem to have smoothed out a bit on Xbox Series X, so that’s off to a good start at least. Also, while my online play was limited prior to launch, the handful of team-ups I did have went smoothly, and the online multiplayer functionality here is pretty easy to understand, so barring any network issues I think it’ll work pretty well at launch. For the time being I’m calling this a review in progress primarily because I’ve not approached the end game content yet, which if you’ve any experience with Monster Hunter styled games like Wild Hearts, you’ll realize that can be a pretty major component. So for now I’ll hold off on giving this a proper score, but will say that everything I’ve played so far has been immensely promising.",,,,,,,"Wild Hearts is not without its qualities. It even manages to captivate us during certain moments of grace, notably with its lively, nervous and dynamic gameplay as well as with its colourful bestiary. The ability to build structures on the go during battles is a real advantageous edge, both offensively and in our movements. Despite its first few hours which are hard to take in hand, it gains momentum as you unlock new game mechanics. It must be said that technically speaking, it is weak and it suffers from a badly-designed camera that barely does its job.",,,,,,"Wild Hearts often feels like a game that doesn’t want to be played. It’s fussy, it’s janky, and it constantly trips itself up. An erratic gameplay loop, an absolute bastard of a camera, and some ill-conceived weapon gimmicks prevent Koei Tecmo and EA’s experimental hunting joint from ever really succeeding where its genre rivals have. It’s ironic that building is such a core part of this game: if this is the start of a series, Omega Force has laid down some important groundwork, but it needs to do make some serious structural revisions from the foundations up if it ever wants to look eye-to-eye with Capcom’s imposing juggernaut.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wild Hearts is a solid enough first attempt at taking on the Monster Hunter crown, but its occasionally frustrating battles, its rather small number of monsters and the fidgety nature of its admittedly inventive gadget system mean you have to put up with a fair degree of irritation if you want to see it through.",,,,,,,,,,"The gameplay matters most in Wild Hearts – it’s fresh, chaotic, and breathless. It does not reinvent the hunting genre, but it does just enough with its addition of the Karakuri gadgets and arresting locales (not to mention the myriad ways to traverse them) to give the genre a fresh and welcome perspective. A stronger story would have been welcome, and the camera leaves much to be desired, but Wild Hearts is a deeply engaging experience even with these faults.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Though certainly one of the stronger hunting games to come from a rival, Wild Hearts might only truly shine with a sequel that will live or die by how players respond to its convoluted, but impressive, main gimmick.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wild Hearts brings a uniqueness to the monster hunting genre that keeps the experience feeling refreshing. The Karakuri and different weapon options are very fun to experiment with and present interesting combat opportunities. The game never felt repetitive and performance issues were minimal. Overall, Wild Hearts capitalizes on what made monster hunting games so much fun in the first place while still giving fans of the genre a new reason to get excited and dive back into the fight.",,,,,,,,,,"Wild Hearts does not revolutionize the hunting game genre, but with as few competitors, that is hardly necessary. The building system both in and outside of combat adds enough variety and depth that the simpler weapons and streamlined crafting are welcome. Sadly, technical flaws, such as blurry visuals and horrendous pop-in keep this otherwise great game from making a play on Capcom's throne. It is a title, however that we're eager to see expanded upon and further developed in the already planned title updates and hopefully eventually in a sequel. As it stands, it's a fun alternative to Monster Hunter, but cannot live up to those games' polish and sheer endless depth of content.",,,,,,,"The controls are simple, there aren’t a bunch of sub menus and things, and everything just works well. I would like to see some improvements to AI and things in the future but with an aggressive post launch plan that includes more monsters (kemono) and story beats, Omega Force is firmly behind Wild Hearts and that can only mean good things for the monster hunting market at large.",,,,,,,,,"I'm having a wonderful time with WILD HEARTS and I can't wait to take on more monsters with online folks as I have a few tricks that I'd like to show off. Overall, this is a phenomenally fun and fully-featured monster-hunting game that I'm sure you'll love.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Minor camera issues aside, Wild Hearts is a stunning action RPG that offers more than enough of a base to build a franchise on top of. Its fantastic creature design and lush landscapes make every hunt feel fresh, and its Karakuri system allows each biome to feel more personal with each trip.",,,,,,,,,,,"Wild Hearts is another great monster-hunting title that suffers the most from comparisons to the well-established Monster Hunter series. The developers have promised that DLC is on the way in the coming months with more kemono and karakuri, and it’s all going to be free with no paid updates in the plans (not yet, at least), so there’ll be more to bring you back to Azuma. Even after finishing the main game, there’s plenty left over in the endgame to challenge hunters hungry for more. It’s an impressive effort, with a world that continually beckons hunters to return. Gear up, for the hunt is on.",,,,,,,,,"A well-crafted tribute to Capcom's Monster Hunter series that adds a few new tricks to go beyond what the original has to offer. Omega Force delivers a strong debut that isn't without its weaknesses in terms of the weapon system and story, but overall a fun and entertaining hunting experience.",,,,,,,,,,,"Wild Hearts is a real raw gem. It has all the ingredients to easily turn into a series that can challenge Monster Hunter. The only thing Koei Tecmo needs to do is polish it up a bit more, fill in the gaps and bring more content.",,,,,,,

That being said, that's probably just a 'me' thing. If you're a fan of the show you'll likely really enjoy it for its authenticity. I do think it's a solid enough rpg but I wouldn't say I'm in love with it quite yet.","One Piece Odyssey is a great game for fans of the series, as it offers a chance to explore the world of One Piece and interact with its characters. The combat system is engaging and the open-world environment allows for a lot of exploration and replayability. However, some players might find the controls a bit clunky, and the pacing of the game can be slow at times.",,,"One Piece Odyssey is a darn good RPG, but it’s hampered by being very slow out of the blocks.",,"A must-play for all fans of the manga/anime. A perfectly written adventure that boast the most traditional JRPG elements.

While not a masterpiece, it offers a nice breath of fresh air for licensed anime games. Unfortunately, narrative pacing and an inconsistent technical department make for a diluted and boring experience, but it remains recommended to both fans of the saga and JRPG fans in general.","One Piece Odyssey is a great game that has points that penalize excessively and end up taking their toll. With a story that at first seems very interesting but that deflates as the 30 hours or so that it lasts progresses and a mission system that becomes heavy, it remains in a I want and I can't in many sections. With a battle system that could give much more of itself, a narrative that becomes repetitive, and very faithful but tiresome animations, One Piece Odyssey loses the opportunity to be an epic game and remains just a good game.",,,,"Redundant and not very rhythmic, it risks leaving some players on the floor. But still, thanks to its engaging universe and its ingenious combat system, the game holds up well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite some flaws, One Piece Odyssey is a fine tribute to the original work. In our opinion, it is the best One Piece video game adaptation to date. On the other hand, it is essential to take into account that the game fully follows the traditional codes of JRPGs, while making them more accessible. The choice of turn-based combats does not do justice to the spectacular battles and moves seen in the anime.

The Straw Hats crew themselves are a great group, I enjoyed the camaraderie and the jokes (even though I didn’t catch all of them). They care for one another just like any good family does and it was a touching story to see. Aside from the combat feeling overly easy for a good portion of the game, and the UI issues I would recommend One Piece Odyssey to fans of the series and non-fans alike. Especially if you are a fan of JRPG’s, this one has it all for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Where Odyssey takes the top spot are the turn-based battles. The familiar skills of the Straw Hats are put to full use in a simple but highly effective system of rock, scissors, paper. Luffy's Gum Gum attacks, Nico Robin's many arms, Usopp's hilarious weapons and Franky's blinding nipples, they rarely looked so stunning and never get boring.",,,,,,,,,,"Although it has the potential to be the best One Piece game, Odyssey fails to hold interest due to its limited exploration, ups and downs story, as well as being slow and repetitive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even with all that, it is a remarkable and addictive proposal.",,,,,,"Tiny Tina's Wonderlands doesn't disfigure among other members of the prestigious Borderlands saga, even if it doesn't bring significant novelties besides the reinterpretation in a fantasy key, which turns out to be a winning idea anyway. Hilarious and irreverent dialogues, a satisfying gunplay and an end-game that hardly gets boring are the elements that will keep you glued to the game.","Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is a great first attempt of Gearbox Software on making spin-offs about the Borderlands franchise. With marvellous gameplay, an excellent cast of characters and an original fantasy world, it's many flaws makes the experience less original.","Tiny Tina's Wonderlands expands on Borderlands 2's Assault on Dragon Keep DLC in some interesting and meaningful ways, but feels like it struggles to stretch out what was a fantastic gimmick for a shorter expansion to fill a full-length campaign without falling back on repeating its material.",,"Should you be in the market for more of Borderlands' frenetic looter-shooter mania, then Tiny Tina's Wonderlands fits the bill, its uniquely daft take on fantasy tropes and tabletop board games proving robust and infectiously good fun.",,"Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is a fantastic looter shooter that enhances the Borderlands franchise. What's more, it utilises many much-loved mechanics and has some new elements chucked in. The combination of FPS action and the isometric overworld work perfectly to deliver the crazy plot. Alongside this, the acting is fantastic and you'll chuckle repeatedly from start to finish.",,"Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands does not try to reinvent the Borderlands wheel. Instead, it molds it into something fresh enough to satisfy fans of the series that are looking for more.",,,,"Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is a resounding success and is easily the most fun I’ve had with the series since the release of Borderlands 2. In some respects, I actually think there is a case to be made that this is the best playing game that Gearbox has made, so positive are the changes made to the narrative delivery, class system, and the introduction of the overworld. If you’re a fan of Borderlands, Wonderlands is an extremely easy sell. But, even if you’re a lapsed fan feeling the burn after so many years of Borderlands products, there is so much that is fresh on display that I think you owe yourself a visit to the Wonderlands.",,,,,,"Without any doubts, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is an excellent game, where everything fits perfectly within the Borderlands universe. The offbeat humor, the fast-paced battles, the artistic quality and the game's length make it a must-have title. It's a bit unfortunate that there isn't more melee combat for a Dungeons and Dragons, but the novelty of using spells makes us forget that. Let's hope that the few login issues to join an online session will be solved soon. One last word if you are not convinced yet: Go for it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands doesn’t stray too far from the Borderlands series, but it doesn’t need to when the consistently funny characters and familiar yet satisfying gameplay are this enjoyable from front to back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Maybe there are those who want to laugh their heads off at the humor, and love to rummage through rubbish looking for treasures, but I'm fed up. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands can be fun.

Well, I liked it quite a bit honestly, the humor was good, the acting was excellent from the main cast and the combat was just different enough to keep me engaged and constantly looking for better spells for my ‘SpellBlade’ class. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the class system, Gearbox did a great job of crafting the classes and making them feel unique enough to fit in this fantasy world. While I would have liked to see more synergy between them ala real Dungeons and Dragons tabletop games there is just enough here to make players feel like they are contributing to the group dynamic.

like-a-dragon-ishin!,,,,"Like A Dragon: Ishin finally arrives in the west via a slick remaster that polishes up the visuals whilst also adding some fresh new combat mechanics to boot. This is another super solid entry in the long-running Yakuza franchise, it's perhaps a little more action-focused than usual, a little more on the serious and grounded side in terms of its story, but it also remembers to pack in plenty of the sort of madcap Yakuza substories and side activities that we all know and love. There's an excellent combat system to get stuck into here alongside an epic main campaign storyline that benefits greatly from the game's fascinating historical setting. This one comes highly recommended.","Whilst many of the components of Like a Dragon: Ishin! will immediately feel familiar, that is no bad thing. An adage that franchise fans will repeat is that there is no bad Like a Dragon game, and Ishin continues that trend.",,A missing gem from the Yakuza/Like a Dragon saga.

Like a Dragon: Ishin! is a superlative localisation of a compelling samurai story, that is every bit as good as the series' other best outings. Brilliant.","Like a Dragon: Ishin! provides the show and offers fans of the ""Yakuza"" saga an epic feudal epic at will. This remake in no way distorts the original 2014 experience, but modernizes the visuals and gameplay enough to make the adventure memorable a decade later. Ishin! is not perfect, far from it, and has some shortcomings, especially technical. However, the pleasure of playing a “Yakuza” game is there, and that is the main thing.",,,"Like A Dragon: Ishin! deserves its acclaimed reputation and can only have been improved by this modernising makeover. The story, visuals, sound design, and game mechanics are all top-class. Complexity is the name of the game as usual, but fans of the series will have no complaints about what has been delivered here. Everything that gamers love about the series has been included and improved upon to freshen things up. Even the use of familiar faces feels right when it could have seemed very wrong.",,,,,,,,,,"To finally be able to get our hands on this epic previously reserved for the Japanese public is a real chance for the fans of the licence. Unfortunately, after six episodes in the same format, it is disappointing to live a similar experience once again. If the narration of Like a Dragon: Ishin! is excellent and makes us experience a beautiful adventure, we cannot help but see it as yet another Yakuza, whether in its construction or its side content, but with a samurai filter. If you are still thrilled by the formula, it would be a shame to miss it.",,,,,,,,"It’s not the best title in the series, and it could have definitely benefited from less padding, but it is a good one, and it’s nice to finally see it in the West.",,,,,,,"Like a Dragon: Ishin is a near-perfect package for fans of the series. It weaves an intriguing tale founded in historical events that has you hooked from the very start and eager to learn more at the very end. There’s a wealth of lighthearted substories, minigames, and slice-of-life gameplay, which offer a nice change of pace from the dark storyline. The weapon-based combat is a much-needed reinvigoration for the series that offers fast-paced, bloody carnage in style. The only real letdown was the few graphical issues I experienced, which hopefully a patch will soon resolve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In its still somehow unique blend of humour and heart, spectacle and introspection, that Like a Dragon roars loudest.

call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii,"It’s been a long time since a Call of Duty campaign has really impressed me to this level, honestly, probably since 2007’s original Modern Warfare. While I’ve played the vast majority of each since for the most part, none have been really all that memorable as a whole. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II may not have the shock value that Modern Warfare 2 (2009) had with news outlets talking about its infamous “No Russian” airport mission, but it doesn’t need to with its movie quality campaign that was not only satisfying in almost every way, but left me craving a direct sequel for its campaign. A first for me. [Campaign Review Score = 93]","While the yearly Call of Duty is experience still remains fun, retreading old ground yet again is beginning to give off the feeling that there’s nowhere else to go for the franchise right now. I had fun playing Modern Warfare II, and those looking for solid shooting action will enjoy it, but I’d liked to see something new from the series going forward. Warzone 2.0 feels far fresher and more enjoyable to me, and is where I’ll be spending my time with COD until then.",,"Infinity Ward has delivered its best Call of Duty game since the original Modern Warfare 2 (from way back in 2009) with this year's release. The game's campaign mixes things up rather nicely, delivering a more tactical outing this time around, and the game's multiplayer caters to almost every type of Call of Duty player out there. While the non-Zombies co-op mode is an expected low point, MW2's multiplayer component is jam-packed and well-balanced, creating a compelling reason to keep returning to its huge online sandbox. Modern Warfare 2 won't convince the CoD haters out there, but this year's release is a return to form after one of the franchise's major lows in 2021's Call of Duty: Vanguard.",Modern Warfare II is most definitely a Call of Duty game; a good one to boot; things are going in the right direction with this iteration.,,"Modern Warfare 2 is the best Call of Duty to date.

All this is accompanied by an increasingly stunning technical compartment. Call of Duty is alive and well, and this is definitely the best chapter in several years.","Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is not only a worthy successor to the 2019 installment, but with certain tweaks here and there, it manages to offer a superior experience to its predecessor.

Fans may gripe and groan about the changes, but I adored the methodical action and problem free gaming.","Modern Warfare II is not as courageous as the previous one nor as revolutionary but it is still a fun, galvanizing and filled in content war FPS, enriched by a technical realization of absolute value.","As finer an example of “AAA” Hollywood gaming spectacle as ever there was – full of incredible visuals and set-pieces with a tonne of gameplay variety and only a few moments that fall flat.

The campaign is a huge step down from its original namesake, and the multiplayer has disappointed me on many levels. I know Activision loves to get a slice of the CoD pie every single year, but I still think we’d be better off with fewer titles, bigger innovations.","The 2019 Modern Warfare saga reboot had given a fresh coat of paint to the Call of Duty license thanks to a convincing multiplayer and solo campaign. Three years later, Infinity Ward has come up with an even more accomplished version. The campaign is enjoyable and benefits from a great deal of work on its staging to keep us on our toes. However, some bits and pieces tend to make us sigh. As regards the multiplayer, the 2019 base remains more or less the same with some welcome new features on the camouflage system. Yet, the unlocking of attachments is questionable. All in all, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II turns out to be a great vintage and will undoubtedly be successful.","Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II will not convince non-believers to jump into Call of Duty. If you’re a fan, you’ll be buying it. If you’re a relapsed fan, you’ll likely come back. And if you hate Call of Duty, you’ll still hate it. It’s a solid effort with a well-designed campaign that feels like you’re playing a summer blockbuster movie. The multiplayer, although severely lacking some key ingredients such as hardcore, the ability to ping, and crossplay issues, is still quite enjoyable. It’s still Call of Duty multiplayer, but it brings enough fresh tweaks to keep us fans happy.",,,,,"Modern Warfare 2’s campaign is a cocktail of modern mechanics, updated characters, and callbacks to classic missions and villains.

The party is spoiled somewhat by inconsistent pacing, technical issues, and incongruous mechanics, shoehorned in from what will ultimately be the game’s multiplayer suite.

While the game could be accused of continuing series tradition, I believe this game out of all the most recent Call of Duty titles is the most honest of its inspirations and its intention. This is the Call of Duty that tries and succeeds to recapture the spark that lit the gargantuan fire that is the Call of Duty franchise we know today. The original Modern Warfare trilogy started an empire. MW2 has ensured that its fall won’t happen for a good while longer, thanks to unparalleled multiplayer action and pure campaign spectacle. While there is always room for improvement and a desire from some sections of the fanbase to try something completely different; Modern Warefare II proves itself to be a spiritual sequel and a rebirth for the series moving forward into this new and exciting console generation.","Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer is filled with mindless fun and lots of ways to grind, and it serves as a solid evolution and refinement of its predecessor. Although it's fun, the tried and true PvP is bogged down by some confounding design choices, lackluster maps with zero staying power, and missing features. It's a fine game. I've enjoyed my time with it, and it's a game I will continue to play which is something that couldn't be said about last year's game.

The enjoyable moments of the campaign are tarnished by unnecessary limitations, technical problems, and pacing issues.

I still recall what it was like to experience the original 2009 Modern Warfare 2’s satisfying gut-punch of a finale. Unfortunately, this year’s campaign did not end on nearly as satisfying or memorable a note.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If Vanguard was seen as a disappointing misstep by fans (and even Activision’s own expectations), Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2’s attempts to bring the franchise away from its Second World War setting will likely be met with relief.

But if you do begin to love Exo One, you’ll start to understand the draw; the great experience of travelling through wonderful magical alien worlds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite everything, a very nice adventure to discover.","Exo One is a tremendous title that stands out from its peers. Its easy controls and excellent aesthetics make it a joy to play. If the developers had added extra elements to the latter stages, then it would have been perfect.","Exo One is at the same time more and less than an actual video-game. It's an out-of-body experience that brings the player across the stars for a couple hours, depycting the closest image to actual meditation we have ever seen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Exo One does have a narrative of its own, one which you can take or leave, but the emotional gravity it manages to imbue into each and every movement of your ship, especially in the closing level of the game, leaves you with the feeling that even in this massive, lifeless expanse, your pilot has only one place they truly want to be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A short and interesting interstellar trip that lacks the spark to become truly memorable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A short, sharply designed and immensely gratifying experience, Exo One is a trippy space ship journey worth taking.

spellforce-iii-reforced,"I honestly wasn’t sure what to expect from Spellforce III: Reforced simply due to a RPG/RTS hybrid coming to console has some serious hurdles when transitioning keyboard and mouse to a controller. Is it a perfect experience, no, it actually takes a good few hours of fighting the controls to get a natural hang of it, but it does eventually become easier to understand. Once you can get over the clumsy controller commands and figure the best way to complete the RTS sections, Spellforce III: Reforced can be a pleasant surprise that you’ll have a hard time putting down, probably even more so once the online components actually function.",,,,"There is a lot to love about SpellForce III Reforced, especially if you are an RPG and RTS fan.

Sadly, its multi-faceted approach reduces its depth, but this shouldn't put you off. It has taken long enough to arrive on console, so sit back and enjoy the crazy ride.",,Spellforce III: Reforced is a great package with a lot of content for players who are into a vibe of playing games like Baldurs Gate and Diablo or fans of RTS games like the original Warcraft 3 or Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War series.

no-more-heroes-iii,"As a pretty big and unexpected fan of No More Heroes and its sequel, I had high hopes for No More Heroes III, and looked forward to finally being able to play it. However, the end result was a mediocre-at-best game that I didn’t enjoy all that much and sometimes looked forward to simply finishing. This sequel lacks a lot of the charm of the first two games, but isn’t bad by any means. It’s just decent. Too much of the experience feels like busy work, as opposed to fun content.","No More Heroes 3 is a solid return of the cult classic series, and one that fans will not want to miss out on. It might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but give this geeky assassin a chance and you might just be won over.",,"No More Heroes 3 is a solid addition to Xbox's growing library of games by Japanese creators. If you've not played a NMH title before, this is worth a look, but you will get more out of it if you start from the original game. As for returning fans, the third outing plays better on Xbox, and while it might not necessarily be the standout chapter for everyone, it’s still a fun send off for Travis Touchdown.","No More Heroes 3 is a slick, stylish, and aesthetically cool game, one that will go down a treat with hack and slash or beat ‘em up fans.",,"Travis Touchdown, the ranking number 1 assassin, is back, now against an intergalactic threat to protect the planet and his honor in No More Heroes 3. Despite some technical issues it’s great adventure to all its fans.",,,,,"No More Heroes III for current-gen consoles addresses many of the visual performance issues of the 2021 Switch version while also preserving all the quirks, style and flash that made the original so enjoyable despite them, making it the definitive version that fans and newcomers alike should play.",,"No More Heroes 3 is made in Suda51's unique style, which can be summed up as a hyperviolent and crude hack-and-slash action game but brimming with originality and artistry, full of pop culture and anime references to mostly non-special franchises. The aesthetic is dissonant, but unique. You're not going to find anything like what No More Heroes 3 offers in any other game, for better or worse. And that's what makes this game, despite the crassness of its B-series style, fascinating and out of the ordinary. The worst thing about the game is its ""open world"" city, empty and ugly. And the best thing is the aesthetics and style of the bosses and the battles against them. And of course, the evil E.T. story.",,,"Games like No More Heroes III are remarkably rare. Brimming with ideas and genuinely humorous moments, this is something uniquely Grasshopper, uniquely Suda. Get on it as soon as humanly possible.",,"No More Heroes III is a semi-open-world title that is confusing as hell. With many side quests, loads of missions, and badass swordplay, this is a colourful and repetitive arcade fighting experience. Sadly, its strange ways won't be for everyone, but I enjoyed the madness nevertheless.",,,,,"No More Heroes 3 is a welcomed good time for fans of the series and may be a little hard to get into for new fans. Its crude humor remains the same (taking a dump activates your save files), but there is something very punk rock about this game that Suda51 has given us here. If you can look past its clunky visuals and repetitive gameplay, you’re in for a treat. This an excellent send-off for Travis Touchdown and his friends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No More Heroes III is one of my favourites in the series so far. A streamlined structure, some fantastic writing, and direction from Goichi Suda and some of the tightest combat the series has ever seen make No More Heroes III one of the best. The latest ports rectify most of the performance problems seen in last year's Switch debut, remedying some minor blemishes on an otherwise remarkable artistic achievement. This is, without a doubt, the best way to experience No More Heroes III.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The combat’s solid aside from certain encounters where the lack of defensive tools causes frustration. The variety in boss battles and unique encounters runs the gamut between being thoroughly inspired and soul crushingly insipid, and even the overworld where odd jobs happen is cute in a retro way… while ultimately feeling more pointless and lifeless than it did in the original. In short, No More Heroes 3 often falls short of its true potential, but that’s not to say that it never shines.",,,,,,What makes this version of the game the one to own is that No More Heroes III is by far the best in the series. Now it is not compromised as far as tech goes. It now runs brilliantly. This allows Suda51’s vision to be fully realized. I fell in love with this game on Switch and now I also enjoy playing it. There is so much to enjoy and discover in the third entry in the series and it is always nice to see more Japanese games dropping on Xbox. So it feels like a win/win across the board. Do not sleep on this wacky adventure. It is truly unlike almost anything I have ever played. It never failed to entertain me and I hope we see the two old games also ported to these new consoles. Give me all the Travis Touchdown.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
scarlet-nexus,,"I love Scarlet Nexus. Its technological post-apocalyptic environment, smooth and flashy combat mechanic combined with its genre of an anime RPG, was just executed so well. Sure the game towards the end might seem a little bit tedious but you just can’t help but focus on the good things that made this game such an enjoyable experience. This game is to not be ignored.",,"While its story falls short, Scarlet Nexus is expertly elevated with stunning combat. The consistent evolution, polished control scheme, and powerful feedback make each fight more satisfying than the last. If only the game had managed to incorporate a stronger story, more depth to its character bonds, and more things to do outside of combat, Scarlet Nexus could have been something special. As it stands, it feels like a solid first step for a new IP, and one where a sequel could really steal the show.","If you enjoy an ARPG, spending time with Scarlet Nexus is a no-brainer - the story and action is strong enough to suck you in and keep you playing. With time travel, psychic powers and huge monsters to kick in the teeth, it’s one hell of a roller coaster ride from start to finish. The slight let-downs of the side quests aside, this is a more than assured entry into the genre, that wholeheartedly deserves a whirl.","Despite its drawbacks and anime quirks, Scarlet Nexus can’t hide the fact that is a product made with love and care. Although it stands a bit in the niche side of things due to its full-blown anime characteristics, the story is solid and the combat system fun and unique. Definitely more robust than Code Vein, Scarlet Nexus can be a fun medium while waiting for Bandai Namco’s big hitters, Tales of Arise and Elden Ring.","Scarlet Nexus is one of the best ARPGS of recent years, and a must-have for 2021.",,,"Scarlet Nexus looks and performs really well, especially on next-gen hardware, but its gameplay is noticeably last gen. While it doesn't do anything new, it also doesn't screw up the basics either and should please Xbox fans looking for an anime fix.",,,"Scarlet Nexus doesn't bring revolutions, but it manages to enhance its strengths with dynamic and fun gameplay, a cast of well-defined characters and a deep and mature story, all spiced up with a unique artistic style. A title definitely worth trying for all fans of Action-JRPGs.",Scarlet Nexus is arguably one of Bandai Namco's best games. Its deep combat system and a plot that makes you want to know more at every turn make the game a highly recommended product for fans of the ARPG genre.,,,"Going rather heavy on its convoluted, nutty storyline, Scarlet Nexus delivers on all fronts as far as its combat is concerned, with fast, flexible action that's always a joy. Bandai Namco's game is certainly bizarre, but it's also unique and well worth playing - it's the best Brain Punk game ever made.","Scarlet Nexus is a big hit when it comes to the action. With its nervous and supercharged fights, you quickly become powerful controller in hand, especially when you can borrow the power of your allies on the fly. This action is helped by framerate which does not falter on next-gen consoles despite the deluge of effects on the screen which can cause readability concerns. If the proposed universe is visually attractive, we regret not being able to enjoy it anymore because of a cruel lack of additional content. Ditto for the story which is certainly interesting but which is served by a more than minimalist staging. A good first draft which, we hope, will serve as a solid basis for a more ambitious sequel in the years to come.",,,,,"Scarlet Nexus delivers a game that hits every gameplay beat flawlessly, providing the player with stylish visuals to enjoy, all mounted on characters and a narrative that only sometimes lands. However, the narrative struggles shouldn’t be nearly enough to keep anyone who loves fast-paced action games from reveling in just how fun, cool, and bombastic Scarlet Nexus’s gameplay is.","Obviously, your enjoyment of Scarlet Nexus will likely be greater if you actually do enjoy anime (or maybe not – or all I know, this game’s story may be horrifically bad!). But if you’re indifferent to the genre, you shouldn’t let that stop you from enjoying a very fun action game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Scarlet Nexus is an amazing Japanese action RPG game, at the start it could give a feeling of an average anime game, but the amazing designs, blend of action and RPG, interesting story are a great blend to one of 2021 games you don't want to miss.",,,"Described by its developers as a title in the “brainpunk” genre, I've come to think of Scarlet Nexus as a mixture of the likes of Bayonetta, Code Vein and Persona, at some times deliciously chaotic and at others frustratingly so.",,,,,"It’s understandable to take a look at Scarlet Nexus and write it off as “just another anime game,” but doing so would be a big mistake. This is an ambitious undertaking from Bandai Namco, one that attempts to blend the two disparate genres of character-action game and large-scale JRPG, and achieves an impressive level of success. Its combat and thin enemy variety don’t hold up all the way to the end of the combined 40 hours of its dual campaigns, but its story and characters absolutely do, and make for a surprise breakout hit of 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,If you ignore the lackluster story Scarlet nexus will offer a great action game.,,,,,,,,,,,"The more serious technical issues will likely be addressed in future Scarlet Nexus updates, but in the meantime, the game is still a safe bet for big anime and Japanese action-RPG fans. There's serious bang for the buck, as Scarlet Nexus has New Game Plus and is stuffed with content, being one of the few games with two playable characters where going back through with the other one is actually a worthwhile endeavor. If the combat didn't lose its luster in the last five hours or so and if it wasn't bogged down with so many boring static cut-scenes, it would be much easier to recommend it to everyone else, too.",,,,,,,,,,,"Even though the plot devolves into a trope-filled sludge pool by the end, I don’t feel like Scarlet Nexus was a waste of time. Yes, the excitement of combat begins to taper off towards the end of Scarlet Nexus’s twenty-odd-hour runtime--and the areas in the final stretch of the game feel overly long--but I had a good deal of fun mixing up my SAS abilities, crushing enemies in my Brain Field, and watching my team have a video game tournament at our base to settle an argument over living space boundaries. It might not be a new pinnacle of action-game storytelling, but Scarlet Nexus is still plenty of fun in the right places.",,,,,,,"Even when Scarlet Nexus fulfills its promise to deliver an entertaining combat system and the graphics are worthy of the Xbox Series X, the story lacks of sufficient basis to say it's good. The characters fall under the typical Japanese game cliché and is boring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While I did have some fun with Scarlet Nexus, I am left with the feeling that it could have been more. If there was more life to the city, and any life at all to the frequently drab mission locations, all of the traversal in the game would have felt a lot less like traversal and the world would have felt more immersive and fleshed-out. The combat has its unique aspects, but there is a repetition to it that is exposed by the volume of battles that you will fight against the same enemy types. While it is a plus that the game essentially gives you two campaigns, you may find yourself having had enough after making it through one.","Scarlet Nexus aspires to be an anime. It succeeds with flying colors, as evidenced by the beautiful style, but regularly loses itself in the story that is difficult to get going and requires a lot of attention to be able to make sense of it. Thankfully, the lightning-fast battles make the heart race and leave you wondering what happened. But in a good way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Scarlet Nexus surprises with its ecstatic, colourful combat and cast of characters. However, experiencing the story is a test of endurance due to its dull presentation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
need-for-speed-unbound,,,,,"Need For Speed Unbound is an attempt to recapture the glory days of the Need for Speed franchise, and to a large degree, it succeeds. There are annoyances, such as the cheap AI, ridiculous driving effects and music, and the ability to steer your car in the middle of a jump, but against that is set a strong upgrade mechanic, fun races and great set pieces, not to mention some intense police chases.",,Need for Speed Unbound comes to our consoles to bring us the adrenaline of street racing. Criterion has once again made a really interesting installment for fans of the franchise. NFS is back.,,,"Criterion has managed to create a vibrant, beautiful, high octane Need for Speed entry that dares to breathe new life into a franchise that desperately needed it.",,A great leap forward for Criteron and easily the best title in the series in years.,"Need For Speed Unbound presents a unique style with a very good technical production, with great vehicle customization and tuning features. Unluckily, though, it doesn't fully convince due to lack of real innovation in gameplay, unevenly balanced difficulty and excessively slow progression tied to too small rewards obtained in every event. The online mode being separated from the story one feels counterintuitive and not on par with modern arcade racers, as well.","Needs improvement. That is the conclusion I ended up reaching after playing approximately a little over 13 hours of the game, passing the story mode and playing races in the online mode. Need for Speed Unbound feels like a Need for Speed from the Black Box stage but at the same time it gives me the feeling that all they have done has been to improve what was already present in Need for Speed Heat.",,,"A startling return to form for EA's flagship racing franchise, Need for Speed Unbound offers an enjoyable open-world, with challenging yet gratifying racing, and an infectious sense of gritty urban style.","Unbound succeeds where NFS Heat had failed, namely to give a little life and flavor to the discovery of the open world called Lakeshore City.",,,"Need For Speed Unbound, even at its launch, is certainly rather packed with content. The story sees the player throughout 4 weeks of days and nights throughout many events, some mandatory and most optional, with players always being able to decide how many seen-before events they wanna rush through again for some extra cash. With tons of unlockable and upgradable cars, a robust if uninspired multiplayer and an open world with plenty of things to do, Unbound’s unlikely to last you less than a couple dozen hours, unless you get bored before the end credits of course. But boredom isn’t what I’d associate with the latest installment in this everlasting franchise: Need For Speed has found its identity, and while a few concepts require some finetuning, it’s the best episode in a long while and one of the most stylish and generally finest racers of the generation thus far.",,,"It is very hard to stand out in this much crowded racing genre, but Need For Speed Unbound pulls it off. The title is easily the best entry in years and sets a foundation that can easily be built upon. After many years of having an identity crisis, I can see the game evolving from here. With a consistent 4K resolution and 60fps framerate NFS Unbound showcases what could be the future of the series.",,,,,,,"During the trailer of Need For Speed Unbound, the cel-shading visuals made us grit our teeth a little bit. It turns out that after a few minutes of action, we realise that the British studio has expertly blended this type of graphics to the rest and it is quite stunning! As far as the story goes, it is well introduced and quite catchy. As regards the handling aspect, this is a pure NFS experience, therefore something close to arcade style. Thanks to an energetic soundtrack, the races are full off rhythm and the police chases keep us glued on the edge of our seat when we carry a large amount of money. The only downside might be the limited interaction between single and multiplayer. To cut to the case, whether visually speaking or with the controller in hand, this game is a real success. For fans of the genre, you will surely have a great time. For the others, we strongly invite you to give it a spin!",,,,,,,,"When Unbound works, it’s like driving a gorgeous, humming sports car. When it doesn’t, it’s like driving a rental with a rough-running engine. That doesn’t mean it isn’t worth the ride, but it does mean a few spots could use a tune up to make this road trip smoother.",,,,,,,,,"Need for Speed Unbound hasn’t strayed very far from the fundamentals of 2019’s Heat, but its bold new animated style impresses.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Need for Speed Unbound feels like a foundational entry for where the series could go from here. Competing across the title’s many events is a blast, and I love the juxtaposed visual aesthetics. Though some elements left me wanting, Unbound is as much fun as I’ve had with a Need for Speed title in years.",,,,,,,"Need for Speed Unbound is a good mix of cartoon characters, graffiti and frantic racing, but nothing more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Need for Speed Unbound feels like it comes to a stop before it ever gets going. The polish in the moment-to-moment gameplay cannot be ignored, but as a whole, Need for Speed Unbound is just another forgettable entry in the long-running franchise.",,"Bringing a fresh new art style to the franchise that we hope sticks around for years to come, this ain't your daddy's Need for Speed. And maybe, that's a good thing. With Heat pushing the franchise in a bold new direction, Need For Speed Unbound borrows almost everything that made that title special and improves upon it.",,,"Even though it's not perfect, Unbound still is the best NFS since Underground and manages to put the license back on track.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Need for Speed Unbound has a few original ideas, and though some aspects needed tweaking, the core racing gameplay and a focus on car customization help the franchise keep drifting onward.","Need for Speed Unbound feels like two steps forward, one step back. While the story progression serves as a nice motivation to get better cars and take risks with the police, the newest part of this once-beloved series still falls flat in some regards. Visual presentation is sub-par for a game that advertises itself as game built for the next generation of consoles. While gameplay is fun and taking a lot of inspiration from Burnout with its heavy reliance on drifting and boosts lee, there are a few issues as well. Police, while initially invigorating, quickly becomes a chore as chases drag on forever and can, in the worst case, reset player progress of over an hour. This is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, but “Need for Speed” is still not quite at the best it has been.",,,,,,,,,,,,Criterion takes the reins once more for an arcade racer that’s capable of going toe-to-toe with the all-conquering Forza Horizon. [Eurogamer Recommended],,,,,,,,"After so many years, the Need for Speed series has taken different forms. But now the series took one of the worst. There is a lack of new ideas and motivation. The story is really written very poorly, the interaction between the characters is often stupid, and the schematic career starts to bore you very soon. Add to all this the shallow online multiplayer. Unbound is an example of a game where form won out over function.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Need for Speed Unbound is perhaps one of the franchise's last efforts to stay alive at a time when its glory years are behind it. In the end, it brings together various elements that the fans requested to combine and execute them in a good way, resulting in a fun experience that keeps calling you back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The bar raised with the Heat has reached the next level with Unbound.

samurai-shodown-special-edition,"Much like most fighting games, the barrier of entry is low as Samurai Shodown is simple to pick up and play, but there’s plenty of underlying mechanics that will take some dedication to master. While button mashers won’t fair well, Samurai Shodown plays quite differently from many others in the genre. Being full priced still two years after its launch is a little surprising, but there’s also no other fighters on the market that can boast about 120 FPS.","One of the best entry level fighting games, Samurai Shodown is an excellent return to form for the series. This Xbox series upgrade offers some small but much appreciated upgrades on the original title. Anyone looking to dip their toes into fighting games will do well to start here, that said, there is a lot to dig into after that.",,,"Samurai Shodown on Xbox is an excellent fighting game; one that is incredibly well-made and able to provide a return to form for the franchise. It’s runs at a different tempo to many other popular fighting games available today, but it’s wild fun. Unfortunately the story mode is disappointingly light and the online multiplayer is sparse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Samurai Shodown on Xbox Series X is one for the fans or for those who enjoy games such as The King of Fighters or Metal Slug. While it doesn’t offer next-gen glory on the XSX (e.g. all those bells and whistles of next-gen gaming), it does offer speed and gameplay that runs as 120 FPS that enhances the gameplay of this classic. For newcomers, controls are easy, however the gameplay might be a little tougher to master but nonetheless, it’s a fun game and one that I’m sure fans will revisit many times.",,,,,,,,"A little light on content and a touch on the pricey side, Samurai Showdown on the Series could have perhaps been packaged better. But there is no denying the joy offered by its blood soaked and engaging one on one battles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This is a solid next-gen upgrade for a solid fighting game. It runs better but its biggest problems remain unsolved. I don’t really see it breaking through to become truly mainstream.,,,,,,,,,,,"With the addition of 120 FPS to an already excellent port, the Xbox Series X enhanced edition of Samurai Shodown is an impressive arcade fighter that shouldn't be missed. The game is still receiving DLC additions to its expansive roster, including more guest characters to join the inexplicable addition of Warden from Ubisoft's For Honor. Even with just the base group of fighters and a couple of button-mashing friends, this edition of SamSho is worthy of SNK's legacy and just a whole lot of fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As one of many Ken 'Masters' (very pleased with that one), the initial reaction to Samurai Shodown is a jarring one. Expecting to mow down hordes of AI controlled characters easily and instead getting beaten to pulp in a matter of seconds can be off-putting, to say the least. What quickly becomes apparent however is that gameplay treads the fine and brilliant line of 'easy to play, difficult to perfect'. Once a bit of caution is implemented, not a lot in the genre is as satisfying as a graceful dodge, parry and complete destruction. This is great for forgetting the old ways and embracing the way of the Samurai.",,"In sum, Samurai Shodown is back and the release for the Xbox Series X does very well for itself. Though a little scant on content compared to some others in the genre, this is still a great game for fans of the franchise or the genre.",,,,,,,,,"It’s to SNK’s enormous credit that they’ve kept the Samurai Shodown franchise fresh for long enough to deliver a game in 2021 that deserves to take its place alongside the heavy hitters of the mainstream fighting scene. Sadly, a lack of content means that it’s unlikely to be first choice for the afficionados. Still worth checking out though, especially if you’re able to give it a go at 120fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In a world where fighting games are associated with intricate combos and complex systems, Samurai Shodown thrives in its simplicity. With its focus on defense, a seemingly simple change makes it stand out in a way that makes it feel like a cut above other fighters on the market. Its biggest shortcomings lie in the lack of modes, some characters that feel too much alike and dead online. But with some brilliant gameplay mechanics and approachable combat, this showdown belongs in your fighting game rotation, especially if you can play with a couple of friends.",,,,,,,,,,
sniper-elite-5,"There is a lot that Sniper Elite 5 has going for it that makes it a quality experience. There are some graphical glitches though such as weapons being invisible and some other shortcomings that ding it, and one of the biggest gripes is the actual in game audio. There are moments when you need to listen in on a conversation to get intelligence for something nearby, but the music becomes a dramatic loop of annoyance that if it weren't for subtitles, I probably would have missed out on the information. This applies to every level but can be avoided should you be tactful like I mentioned earlier, but should you go loud and proud, your ears are going to hate you for listening to the same dramatic loop over and over and over and over and over again. Despite all of that however, Rebellion is well on their way to turning Sniper Elite games into tremendously enjoyable sniper experiences and one that I'm personally looking forward to seeing where Sniper Elite 6 takes us.","Despite starting off negatively (the bugs and glitches can easily be fixed with patch), overall I had a good time with Sniper Elite 5, I’d highly recommend every Game Pass member download this and give it a go, whilst fans of the series will also be happy with the new content and Nazi ball-busting opportunities.",,"Sniper Elite 5 is the very best entry in this long-running franchise to date. Karl Fairburne's latest WW2 adventure effortlessly mixes jaw-dropping campaign environments, improved close quarters combat and ruthless enemy AI, resulting in a game that puts this series firmly into the top tier of action titles once and for all. With highly replayable missions stuffed full of secrets and side quests, a clever new PvP Invasion mode, full campaign co-op and a ton of unlockables and multiplayer modes to dig into, this is a hugely entertaining offering that's sure to delight long-term fans and new recruits in equal measure. It's time to get to work perfecting those slo-mo X-Ray balls shots.","Sniper Elite 5 is a triumph. The campaign is great, Survival is brilliant fun and Axis Invasion gives an insight into how other players think. PvP sits in the mix like a wasp’s nest at a picnic, generally being unpleasant and spoiling things, but ignore that and this is a quality title that demands to be played.","Sniper Elite 5 offers a very specific treat to choose from. Everything it does, does it adequately and consistently. There are problems such as the poor AI, the low variety in the gameplay and rough graphics, but the whole package is decent.",Sniper Elite 5 hits the excellence mark dead center with a game that dares to innovate without breaking the formula that we all know and love.,,,,,,,"Sniper Elite 5 is the new entry in the franchise. With more freedom for the player to choose, and a gigantic variety of weapons, sometimes it feels too similar to the previous Sniper Elite games, and Rebellion could have been braver in some aspects.",,,"Another opportunity to eviscerate Nazis, Sniper Elite 5 is by no means perfect, but it is a wonderfully robust and consistently enjoyable sandbox shooter that's good, reliable fun. And, as if you need reminding, you can put a bullet through a Nazi's scrotum, which will never not be brilliant.","Although technically dated, the game offers a neat aesthetic and is based on French landscapes (including the very vertical Mont Saint Michel) which will have a particular resonance with the inhabitants of France.",,,There is added depth and complexity to this title that elevates the experience above the solid game that went before it.,,,,,,"Sniper Elite is a fun game if you play in coop. Alone you will really challenge yourself, and quickly notice the game was meant to be played with a partner. It looks good, but could have been better. The x-ray shots keep on being really cool and during the nine hours the game lasts, you will not get bored easily.",,,,"Sniper Elite 5 may not revolutionise the series, but it is still a fun game to play. The campaign offers well-designed environments, allowing us to choose between many options and paths to progress discreetly – or not – towards the objective. The sniper rifle gameplay remains as solid as ever, and the series’ iconic X-ray killcams are as exhilarating as ever. Unfortunately, the title’s technical design is weak due to stiff animations and textures that are far from pleasing to the eye. The Invasion mode is a nice touch adding a thrilling tension to our sessions and promising some great cat-and-mouse games.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Sniper Elite 5 is stupid fun and a joy to play.

The result is a fairly risk-free sequel, but that doesn't make it any less fun.",,,Your view of Sniper Elite 5 highly depends on what you expect of a good sequel. It delivers the same semi-open-world stealth shooting that its predecessor did so well. However it fails to add anything significant to the formula aside from a graphical update. In certain areas it even feels leaner than the 2017 Sniper Elite 4.

This Banana Mania collection brings the classic games back to the fore, with hundreds of stages to play, a dozen mini games, lots of cosmetics to unlock and more. The gameplay is as challenging – and fun – as ever, and will no doubt garner a new audience of fans that still have youth on their side.",,"Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania isn't going to win any game of the year awards, but it's undeniably fun. While it's perhaps not the entry that will put the series back into the mainstream, fans of the original will likely have a good time and newcomers will see what the fuss is all about. While there are some questionable design choices, such as a finicky camera and microtransactions that feel out of place, this is an enjoyable adventure with AiAi and his friends.","Banana Mania is the ultimate Super Monkey Ball collection: the best levels, the best minigames and the best fun. But don’t let the cute graphics lull you into a false sense of security, even with the questionable quality of life improvements, it remains as tricky and as addictive as ever.","Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania is full of content and a joyful multiplayer to compete with your friends, but its beauty seems to be matched only by its insane difficulty.","Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania brings the best of the franchise to a new generation. Same fun, only enhanced.","This is a fantastic collection that not only fans of the franchise will enjoy, as it feels perfect for newcomers to find what the Banana Mania is all about.",,,,,,"Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is undoubtedly a great way to celebrate the two decades of existence of the franchise, offering such a complete experience that you can get tired of playing its levels and not finish it. This is perhaps its main flaw, that it's not a game that renews itself or changes its mechanics. If you are definitely not attracted to its premise from the start, this may not be the game for you. Its mini-games are great fun to play in meetings with friends.","It's hard to call this an absolutely definitive collection of these classic gaming curios when aspects aren't perhaps quite as authentic as they could be, but when there's so little in it for the most part (and when the aspects that have changed more notably are still great despite feeling different), Banana Mania stands as a feature-packed reminder that 'simple' and 'easy' are not nearly as interchangeable as a lot of people might think.",,"Expertly aping past glories, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania is a definitive compendium of remastered classics, stuffed to the gills with bonus modes, extra characters, and party games.

While the beginning can be slow, and some of the dungeons can be cumbersome to trudge through, the rewarding payoffs are worth the effort.",,,,"In summary, we can say that Atlus has released one of its best cards to step on the Xbox platform stronger than any other company had done. A challenging proposal from Atlus that everyone should play at least once in their life.",,,,"Behind its colorful neon lights, Soul Hackers 2 remains an ""old-school"" role-playing game that strays from more recent titles in its franchise like Persona 5 Royal or Shin Megami Tensei V. Beyond its cyberpunk anime aesthetic, the Atlus' game relies on an ever-effective and proven SMT-like combat system, but also on its friendly cast of characters who stand out for their original designs. Unfortunately, the experience is served by a story that is ultimately quite simple, with some technical shortcomings, but above all by its far too basic and repetitive dungeons which struggle to stimulate the player. A title that has something to please experienced role-playing game enthusiasts.",,,"Soul Hackers 2 is a solid game.

The combat and dungeon delving are entertaining, if fairly familiar, and the charming cast of characters kept me interested all the way through its roughly 60-hour campaign. But a disappointing lack of creativity in its battle systems and a fairly shallow overarching story mean this newly resurrected series will need to do more if it wants to set itself apart amongst Atlus’ best.",,,,,,,,"There’s a lot to like about Soul Hackers 2.

dying-light-2-stay-human,"If it wasn’t apparent, I really liked Dying Light 2, and I think it has improved on the first game, but now for the things that weren’t great from my experience playing. There were a lot of bugs for me in the game. This is one of the main reasons it took as long as it has to get this review out if I’m being honest. A few game breaking bugs that meant I couldn’t progress the main story. They were fixed with a patch, but the biggest problem for me was a pretty massive issue with audio bugs.","Dying Light 2 is an even better-looking game that the previous instalment in the series. I can quite easily see myself spends hours hunting down resources, exploring the game during the night and just finding everything that Dying Light 2 has to offer Not to mention that the story has layers upon layers, so you really do see and feel the consequences of your choices and actions. The game is so unique because of having such an expansive and multi layered zombie survival expereince. If Dying Light got Techland noticed, Dying Light 2 puts them squarely on the map as a big-time developer! If the game can live up to what I have experienced so far then we have a new benchmark for ambitious open world RPG-like Zombie Games.","Dying Light 2 Stay Human’s enhanced parkour and intricate level design make for some of the most fun you can have moving through a video game world, and the hand-to-hand combat is simple but effective. Most impressive is the sense of scale and gravity that makes leaping between rooftops feel so death-defying. Unfortunately, its story wallows in post-apocalyptic clichés and misanthropy, and its choice-based narrative often drops its most interesting plot threads.","Dying Light 2 is a pretty disappointing sequel to one of our all-time favourite zombie games. The parkour and combat here feels slightly off-point, light, floaty and unsatisfying. The first game's signature tense melee encounters feel diluted in a setting that gives you far too much space to catch your breath and night-time sorties lack the straight-up fear factor that made them so appealing first time around. With a lacklustre campaign that offers little to enjoy in the way of drama, some serious performance issues - which we hope will be patched day one - and an enormous world stuffed full of basic busywork padding, this is one zombie apocalypse we're finding quite hard to recommend.","It’s not without issues, but the brilliance of the parkour and deepness of the combat easily outweigh the various bugs and glitches which pop up. Perhaps it’s not able to revolutionise the genre like the first game did, but Dying Light 2 Stay Human is still more than worthy of your time, patience and hope of staying human.","Dying Light 2 is improving the first game in almost every aspect. Be that as it may some of the improvements, such as in the combat system, are not enough to truly make them excel. On the other hand, it needs to be said that its parkour system creates new standards for the first-person genre as well as the design of the city creates an organic playfield for this method of traversal.","Dying Light 2 is no longer the surprise the first entry was, but it manages to enhance the formula that turned it great and delivers a story that is both action-packed and fun.","Dying Light 2 is a buggy sequel that doesn’t deliver what originally promised, but that still manages to deliver a fun and enjoyable parkour-based adventure.",,"Initially, I was concerned Dying Light 2 wouldn't find its own voice in a world crammed with shallow open worlds designed for busy work rather than fun, but the more I played, the more I found that wasn't the case. Dying Light 2 truly shines with its high-stakes nighttime gameplay, which turns the modern and tired open-world formula on its head. While some of the writing isn't the best and next-gen console performance is a bit disappointing, Dying Light 2 offers a tight experience that builds on the original.",,,"Dying Light 2 Stay Human is a good sequel, even if a bit rough in some places, offering us an open world as ambitious as imperfect, with excellent gameplay and lots of content. Nevertheless, it could have benefited from more technical cleanliness and attention to some key aspects such as A.I. and writing. Still, it has all the cards in order to satisfy those who loved the first chapter or those looking for a different action title from the usual.","Dying Light 2 is the playable evolution any fan of the first installment would expect. However, Techland fails in the narrative and in the execution of many of its ideas. It also has many technical problems.","Dying Light 2: Stay Human is more than a sequel — it’s an evolution that keeps everything that is integral to the franchise intact, but builds on it with enough engaging content that it’s incredibly hard to stop playing. There have been bugs, there have been comical glitches, but my experience has generally been smooth throughout, exciting, and emotionally motivating. I’ve put in around 60 hours so far, and it’s not lost its appeal, even though I might have to play through it again. If you’re looking to explore Villedor later this week, then you’re in for a treat.",,"A more than competent sequel, Dying Light 2 Stay Human conjures some memorable narrative beats in an open world that's never anything but a joy to traverse. Granted, it has one or two niggling issues, but they pale into insignificance when you're knocking off a zombie's head with a massive axe.","If one could fear that Dying Light 2 is a 1.5 version of its predecessor, this is not the case in fact. By taking up all the ingredients that made the success of the first episode, Dying Light 2 reinforces, refines and fleshes them out to put them at the service of a breathtaking, generous, fun and complete experience that offers moments of bravery.","It's gory, tough, but oh so enjoyable.","Supported by a stellar level design and an incredibly receptive story to the player's choices, Dying Light 2 is a very valid action open world RPG, which demonstrates how messy can be the development of beautiful games.",,,,,"It's been a long road to release for Dying Light 2, and at times its future seemed uncertain. However, having braved the ruins of Villedor for this review, I'm happy to report that Techland's long-awaited follow-up to their survival horror RPG is a smashing success. With its mix of gripping narrative, hard-hitting combat, and exhilarating exploration, Dying Light 2 is a spectacular sequel that breathes new life into the franchise.",,,,,,"Techland really is an astonishing studio. Funnily enough, we were amazed by Dying Light 2’s narrative and roleplay even though we had reservations about it and were disappointed by the map design and certain gameplay mechanics, elements which we took for granted until now. Nevertheless, we salute the absolute dedication of an artist’s vision that oozes in the whole game design and the risk-taking to update the gameplay after the first episode’s overwhelming success. Even if the game doesn’t reach the expected heights, it allows Techland to move upwards, which is promising for the future, so let’s meet again in 5 years! In the meantime, Dying Light 2 remains one of the last very good representatives of an open-world formula that marked the previous generation but is at risk of aging badly in the years to come. Enjoy it now, because we had a lot of fun playing it and also because the next big game that will shake things up is yet to be announced.",,,,,,,,Dying Light 2 is a legitimate challenger to join the ranks of the greatest open-world games. But unfortunate bugs and a lack of refinement noticeably separate it from genre luminaries.,,,,"Dying Light 2 faces two big issues at present: technical glitches that can be fixed with a patch, and design choices that will be harder to deal with. When the former are corrected, Techland's latest will be far more enjoyable; that said, the number of times it goes out of its way to break up the fun it's capable of producing could remain its legacy.",,,,,"Dying Light 2 Stay Human is an ambitious zombie action adventure that's packed with top-notch parkour, an awesome open world, and every painful bug in the book.","The product of years of toil from Techland, Dying Light 2 easily exceeds anything they have previously released and is one of the premium open world experiences available today. Any aspiring zombie hunter shouldn’t hesitate to dive right in.",,,,,,,,,,,"Dying Light 2 is an engaging journey of discovery and gaining power. Almost everything you do embraces those dynamics. In evolving beyond the first game's offerings, putting a stronger emphasis on the characters helps shape the world in meaningful ways. Some of Aiden’s choices are difficult, especially those surrounding a character named Lawan – who is given a hell of a pulse by Rosario Dawson. I can’t say enough great things where his and her stories go. I adored almost every second of this game and see myself often revisiting it, as Techland has announced at least five years of DLC is on the way. That’s a wonderful promise to hear when starting a new game that has turned out this well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dying Light 2 presents a detailed and engaging open world that’s genuinely breathtaking in its size and ambition. Excellent parkour traversal makes exploring thrilling, and the extra tension added to night missions improves upon the first game’s horror elements. The action is somewhat dated, however, and the choices you make are rarely reflected in the world in a satisfying way. There’s plenty to enjoy, and if you’re looking for a big action game and a huge map to clear you’ll find a lot to love in the world of Villedor.",,"Dying Light 2 gives us a fantastic world to explore and it's a delight to run around Villedor's rooftops and terraces. The game's plot is not able to keep up with the speed and quality of its acrobatic action, which, even marred by countless bugs, is still an incredibly fun and addictive experience.",,,,,,"Techland is apparently planning years of Dying Light 2 DLC, and while that won't fix the problems that the base game has, perhaps future content will focus on what it does right. Those who liked the first Dying Light will likely be able to overlook the sequel's serious flaws, but unless gamers are starving for a new open-world game, it's better to skip Dying Light 2.",,,"Dying Light 2 Stay Human’s greatest achievement is its freedom of movement, and the playground Techland has designed for you to best leverage that is a triumph of what feels like infinite proportions. At its most fundamental core, at the headiest tine of it all, the game’s promise of an open-world with zombies and near limitless freerunning opportunities is delivered to the letter. Unfortunately there’s much around those three pillars that simply isn’t delivered to the degree it’s obvious the studio would have liked. Whether it’s in performance, pacing or overall balance, across every system Dying Light 2 has cracks in its seams.",,,,,"Dying Light 2 is a leap forward for the franchise, even if it's not going to set the industry on fire with further innovation. Thanks to its fluid and refined gameplay and a distinct world filled with content, it's hard not to be entranced by this sequel even with its shortcomings.",,"Combining engaging combat, some of the most thrilling traversal you’ll find in a video game, and a truly rich narrative, there’s very little to find fault with in Dying Light 2: Stay Human. Whether or not you’ve played the first game, if you enjoy open world adventure games – particularly with a touch of horror – Dying Light 2 should be high on your must-play list. With its delays and long development, Techland almost had us worried, but we had no reason to be. It has delivered an experience which might just be one of the best open world games of recent years.","Dying Light 2 is a perplexing game. Its story and characters are headache-inducing, and it appears to lack polish in many areas. But even a dozen hours after I rolled credits, I've found myself going back to the game to do another parkour challenge, rummage through another abandoned science lab, or just see if I can get from Point A to Point B without ever hitting the ground. It's rough around the edges and it asks players to invest a lot in its weakest element, but once you realize the story, like gravity, is only going to pull you down, you can begin to defy it and enjoy the things Dying Light 2 actually does well.",,,,,,,,,,,"Dying Light 2 might not be the ultimate high-rider that early impressions promised. But more important than that, Techland delivers a sequel that's far better in mostly any aspect. It's technically strong on next-gen, provides a great fluid free running system, a powerful combat system, and combines it with a highly varied and vast open world. Even the story with all its world-changing decisions outperforms the predecessor clearly.","Despite the issues I’ve highlighted, Dying Light 2: Stay Human is an improvement over the original in nearly every way. While there’s plenty to complain about, the world is more interesting, the parkour is fantastic, and the story has more weight — of the two, it’s absolutely the superior game, and the thrill of rocketing through a crumbling city with monsters in hot pursuit is unparalleled in the genre. It’s not perfect, but it’s as good as parkour action gets.",,,,,,"I feel like the best way to describe how I feel about Dying Light 2 is by saying: “I don’t mind it.” It’s got some good things going for it and when it takes off, it gets going well. The problem is it takes a long time to take off. The story gets better eventually, and parkour skills take time to acquire, and the combat boils down to block, dodge, and swing. There’s a lot to do here, but I feel like the mechanics of the game itself gets in the way of really letting the player explore what’s around, and in the end, the rewards just may not be enough to bother with a lot of them. That’s not to say I didn’t have a fun time with the game. I did. There are some great shining moments here and when the story ramped up, I was in it until the end. If you have the patience to get to it, you too can have a good time, but don’t say I didn’t warn you that it will take some time to finally get to it.",,,,,"Techland's vast blockbuster buckles under its own ambition and lacks in innovation, but makes up for it with outstanding parkour and combat.

That’s true for most of Dying Light’s story elements too; from tiny touches, like photos of a dead family in an abandoned house to larger-scale interactions with other characters, the game struggles to emotionally draw you into its conflict. I never cared about saving Mia; my main focus was always on reaching the next objective. The bright side: Despite all those shortcomings, I had an absolute blast doing that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dying Light 2 Stay Human could very likely become the stellar zombie survival adventure it should someday be, provided the bugs are finally wiped out. Its excellent parkour is an amazing way to explore this giant open world of the last tough city, and the post-apocalyptic stories of its many strange and distinctive characters are a must-see. Our bet? If its developers bring us a DLC with a really interesting story (or that solves this ending that we can't swallow), then we'll have the perfect zombie game.",,,"Restoring power to different places, searching for people and clearing out areas of zombies are pretty much the types of activities I’d expected. But I was utterly enthralled by Dying Light 2 Stay Human’s mechanical panache, entrancing soundtrack, and charismatic NPCs.","Let's get one thing straight: I do enjoy playing Dying Light 2 Stay Human. The story is great and warrants additional playthroughs thanks to multiple endings, the combat feels awesome, and there's a ton of stuff to do in this sprawling city (500 hours worth, apparently). It just needs to clean up the technical issues and stop spawning the final boss inside the platform he's standing on, among other things. If that happens, the impact--much like the game itself--will be night and day.",,,,,,,,
as-dusk-falls,,"As Dusk Falls is a stellar example of the narrative adventure genre. A fantastic cast of characters are used brilliantly throughout, with twists and turns galore. The sheer breadth of choice and consequence mean there is scope for several playthroughs, and even when we’re bouncing between characters there’s cohesiveness to the story rarely found in gaming. Top it off with a stunning art style and soundtrack and we have not only one of the best examples of the genre, but one of the best titles of the year so far.","As Dusk Falls is exciting, beautiful, and heavy-handed. Its more streamlined approach to narrative gameplay and its less traditional art style create an immersive experience that engages with the player’s imagination. That it can work both as a morally challenging single-player story and a party game for multiple players speaks to the confidence that its developers have. But its second half of the story undercuts some of the tension that its excellent first half builds, and a terrible cliffhanger might leave you feeling betrayed.","As Dusk Falls is a cracking crime thriller and feels like the exact thing we should be seeing on a regular basis from Xbox Game Studios on Game Pass. Its 6-8 hour length feels just right for a game of this nature, and that also makes it feel right at home on Xbox's subscription service. Oh, and the fantastic storyline that never let us wriggle free of its grip? Yeah, that's not a bad reason to play it on Game Pass either.",It’s rare to find a debut game as confident as As Dusk Falls. It’s rarer still to find one that unerringly finds your belly for an emotional gut punch like this one does.,,As Dusk Falls is an interactive drama that highlights a structure based on the choices we make and the narrative possibilities of each of them.,,"As Dusk Falls caught me by surprise, taking a genre of game that's become a bit too familiar and injecting it with a tense crime drama and a singular flair. My hat goes off to Interior/Night and I’m really looking forward to seeing what they do next.","While the second half of this adventure falls short of the first, As Dusk Falls delivers a captivating story full of drama and consequence that feel true to its American setting.",,"As Dusk Falls is the kind of game that Xbox Game Pass was made for, in the best possible sense of such a compliment; it’s a narrative thriller and adventure that’s easily worth the price of admission, and more importantly, it’s absolutely worthy of your time.","As Dusk Falls is an adult, dramatic adventure with unusual artistic choices, yet functional to an ever engaging narrative. Almost similar to an interactive TV series, it will keep you glued to the screen until the end, eager to discover the fate of the many realistically and often starkly delineated characters, but also to explore the many ramifications of the story. The excellent acting, moreover, succeeds in making the most of such a production. Too bad for a few technical issues lightly impacting the enjoyment of the game, but it is definitely a highly recommended experience for lovers of narrative adventures and TV crime dramas.","If you are looking for a game that offers a deep story, and you have no problem with a gameplay that is limited in terms of real action, but deep in its decision mechanics, then As Dusk Falls is the game for you. On the gameplay side of things I think As Dusk Falls only fails in the occasional action events. They are too simple and after doing them several times, they lose their excitement. In terms of graphics and sound the result is mixed.","For the most part, As Dusk Falls excels as an 'interactive drama.' With wonderfully crafted and relatable characters, superb voice acting, and unique art direction and animation style that lends itself to the story. The first few chapters alone are excellent, and they’ll have you gripping onto your controller when things are tense and utterly deflated when you’re forced into making a tough decision. The game is only let down by a weaker second act and a rushed final chapter, but overall, it’s still a great narrative adventure filled with dramatic moments, tension, and tough choices.",,"Normally, with a choice-driven adventure, I'm once and done, ready for a post-game water-cooler discussion. As Dusk Falls' warrants more than one playthrough, if only to see how differently things can pan out. If that open ending is any indication, there's more to come.","As Dusk Falls tells a touching story whose universal themes (family, forgiveness, loyalty) will speak to a wide audience. Staged with talent thanks to an inspired editing and well-chosen music, the title has the good idea of alternating humor and darkness, moments of bravery and erasure. Fascinating in its first half, the software published by Microsoft struggles to find the same flashes in its last three chapters, which is regrettable. With a restrictive gameplay that will not reconcile those allergic to interactive film with the genre, As Dusk Falls shines with its many choices that cause very real consequences. Isn't that the most important for an Interactive Drama? If you have the Game Pass, it would be a shame to miss out.",,,"As a big fan of cinema and storytelling, I enjoyed the attempt at a mostly well told, if somewhat predictable yarn, full of plot twists and surprises, particularly with friends in tow.","As Dusk Falls can be framed as an interactive movie as well as a TV series. History will make us live in constant tension. Each character will awaken a special feeling in us. Its audiovisual section is unique, with the height of a Hollywood production.",,,,,The art style is unique and it's definitely an experience you should not miss. It takes around 6 hours to complete and is free to play as Game Pass title.,,,"As Dusk Falls has a captivating story with more than a few rocky moments, but is as close to feeling “genre” as it can get. It also has a lot of shortcomings that might only be saved by the interesting multiplayer features. It’s the perfect game to pull out for any digital or physical get-togethers, but is otherwise a reminder of wasted potential.","Even if the gameplay mechanics of As Dusk Falls remain specific to the genre, they are right on point. Its unicity comes from its artistic direction and the quality of its writing. The software leans back and forth between an interactive movie and a narrative game. The quality of the dubbing and the soundtrack are just the icing on a skilfully produced and savoury cake. With a substantial lifespan and almost infinite replayability, the title should be a well-deserved triumph. The possibility for co-op sessions or playing with one's community will certainly contribute to this.","As Dusk Falls delivers a tense, dramatic and thoughtful story. Its narrative is always engaging and player choices feel impactful. While some moments can feel rushed or resolve too conveniently, many others are surprising, moving, and hard to forget.

And most importantly, it doesn’t get distracted or lost along the way.",,,,"Caroline Marshall’s first independent project may not have panned out exactly as planned, but it shows enough potential in its story telling to convince some to give it a try, and if you already own a Game Pass subscription then you are just investing your time, which will probably worth it.","As Dusk Falls is gripping from start to finish and has a lot to say, becoming one of the few games where your choices actually can upend the story.",,As Dusk Falls exceeds all expectations and is a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining experience for single and multiplayer alike.,,"As Dusk Falls is the non-game narrative adventure for your non-gaming family and housemates. It’s the most engaged I’ve ever seen my lapsed casual gamer partner in a videogame and that’s because it has the familiar story pacing of a six-part TV series and almost no gameplay, which means minimal barrier to entry.",,"As Dusk Falls is a stellar first attempt from Interior Night and a must-play for those who enjoy interactive narrative games like The Quarry, Heavy Rain, and Detroit: Become Human. In many ways, the game feels like a playable season of Fargo and even channels other gritty crime dramas like Breaking Bad at times. Essentially, it's a playable binge drama, but one that can be enjoyed time and time again, with different endings and twists, depending on your choices...As Dusk Falls will make you hurt, and it will make you cry, but it won't let you down.",,As Dusk Falls blends Netflix-style prestige drama with Telltale-style game storytelling to great results.,,"An engaging story that gives players a satisfying sense that they control their own destiny, As Dusk Falls is ""choose your own adventure"" at its best.","Good characters, strong performances and well-engineered dual timeline storytelling are let down by pacing that’s utterly arhythmic and gameplay that’s fighting you at every step.","As Dusk Falls tells a superb story of how two family's lives are changed forever, with great writing that leads to some huge decisions to make.",,,,"In terms of the sheer variety of ramifications and final outcomes that this interactive drama has to offer, As Dusk Falls is very well written. But when it comes to artistic choices that have been made, for example, in the field of style and direction, it can sometimes fall far beyond your taste. As in the case of the undersigned Naturally Born Azijnzeiker.",,,"Imperfect but fascinating in terms of style and themes, the INTERIOR / NIGHT adventure wants to tell a lot, and it succeeds in a somewhat discontinuous way. The multiplayer experience is also a valid addition, on a par with what has been seen with the recent Supermassive-branded productions. The plurality of points of view, the never too obvious moral paths and the courage to change the register several times, combined with a graphic novel take, are the cornerstones of a convincing work, yet not fully amalgamated in all its parts. However, this is only the beginning for the team led by Caroline Marchal, and we are sure that the next choices that the collective will make will be more focused than those experienced in As Dusk Falls, whose story may still have something to tell us.","As Dusk Falls is a mixed bag. The story, while certainly not out of this world, provides good characters and a fair amount of drama, but the peculiar art style doesn’t always succeed in conveying the right emotion. The voice-over, and especially the Italian dubbing, also occasionally suffers from the same issue. The multiplayer mode does make the game more engaging, but it’s still an experience with very little interaction. Enjoyment might vary wildly depending on your tastes.","For players interested in the progress of interactive narrative frameworks, it’s a laudable success. But even for someone who never plays games, it works. That’s because good characters and storytelling make for a universal experience, and this is a project that has both.","As Dusk Falls keeps you glued to the screen from the first minute thanks to the developments in the story, which you can influence by the choices you make. The multiplayer gives it an extra dimension and it pays to play the game several times, thanks to the splits in the story. However, the input registration can irritate, because it does not always do what it should, but beyond that a must play.","The first book of As Dusk Falls is compelling, fast and breathtaking, while the second loses all the pace that the story had built up to that point. A great wasted opportunity, for an interactive drama with a lot of good ideas.","As it ran its course, I realised I quite adored As Dusk Falls. As a decades-spanning crime thriller throughout America’s western plains, it’s well acted and admirably realised. Although the cliffhanger beckons another chapter, my journey through As Dusk Falls felt whole, though I can’t wait to explore all of the possibilities on offer.",,"As Dusk Falls works as an intense first season of TV show who just you can't stop binge watch. Interior/Night cinematic adventure works great when tries to depict how three destinies are entwined after a dramatic moment lived together, while sometimes fails to build drama in believable way. Anyway, the strange mix between thriller, teen drama and family story delivers an empathetic narration and compelling gameplay, with some minor flaws here and there.","The main objective of As Dusk Falls is to provide a narrative experience inspired by some of the most successful television series of recent years, such as Breaking Bad. The result? Well, it's a mixed bag.",As Dusk Falls is undoubtedly a better written game than all the others created by Quantic Dream. with beautiful and complex characters and a compelling and mature story.,"I was hoping for As Dusk Falls to share a place with the best and most respected Netflix and HBO productions, but that would be setting the bar too high. I find it more accurate to position it as those simpler and pure popcorn series, ideal to spend a few hours of a gray Sunday afternoon. An ideal entertainment for when we only need something temporary and fun.","What a shame that a story whose opening promises to wade into deeper waters should resort to paddling in the shadows. [Issue#375, p.118]",,,A strong story about how tragic life can be when everything goes wrong.,"An exciting, interactive gangster thriller with an idiosyncratic look and great speakers.","As for me, my little family had a pretty good time playing a chapter each night over the course of a week. And while I doubt I’ll play again — I’m fine with how the story turned out for us — I’m pretty sure my mildly OCD daughter is already plotting to go back and fix all the things I made go wrong with my overrides. Who knows? Maybe she’ll find a way to get everyone through this chaotic criminal saga in one piece. But I doubt it.","While As Dusk Falls’ story is full of thriller cliches and tropes, if you can look past the unique animation style, playing around with the well-written characters’ lives can be a lot of fun.","A tense and dramatic interactive movie with superbly realised characters, a breathless plot, and a still-frame animation style that’s likely to prove extremely divisive.",,,,"Will you enjoy this story-based game? That, quite unsurprisingly, depends on whether you’re going to like the story. The plot twists aren’t great but if you’re interested in dark topics like PTSD, you could leave satisfied.","As Dusk Falls is a fun little entry into the multiplayer movie-game genre. It's neat to see a crime thriller as opposed to a horror movie and that alone lends it some charm. Unfortunately, the second half of the story meanders and is more disconnected than the first half, but it still is worth experiencing at least once. It doesn't quite stick the landing as hard as you'd hope, but it has a lot of potential as a party game.","With a high performance, endless adjustable accessibility parameters and its predisposition to share the multiplayer experience, As Dusk Falls becomes the friendliest bet we have ever seen for people outside the medium to enjoy video games. It is an indie game treated as a triple A. A purchase that we recommend and a Game Pass title that should be a hit at family gatherings and with friends.","As Dusk Falls has a strong start and players will find the game hard to put down for the first two chapters, like a great binge-worthy TV show. Unfortunately, its pacing issues become apparent by the end of Book 1, and it never recovers in Book 2.",,,"After each episode, you even get a chart highlighting the path you’ve taken with spoiler-free hints at the breadth of outcomes and scenes available. And even with all of that, each new twist and turn feels unexpected. As a slice of brand-new interactive choice-driven narrative drama, As Dusk Falls impresses. But it’s an experience held back by its photo-filter visuals and interactivity that never quite feels like an extension of its many dramatic moments.","As a narrative-heavy game that settles you in the director’s seat to drive these characters towards their respective resolutions, it feels like INTERIOR/NIGHT forgot to finish the story. I mean it genuinely, this game just stops. I sat in the main menu for about 20 minutes trying to work out if I had fenced myself into an abrupt ending or if there was a giant “continue” button in my blind spot. I went back to what I thought were pivotal decisions and chose the opposite to see if that would change the paths, and it didn’t.","There's a lot to love in As Dusk Falls. Everything surrounding the game is thoughtful. The multiplayer aspect is very smart, the Twitch integration is well thought, and the narrative tree is well made. Unfortunately, all these great ideas serve a story that has been told many times before, relies on clichés, and misses the mark on many of its more sensitive themes.","As Dusk Falls is a very unique game with a distinctive art style. Off to a strong and gripping start, it loses its touch on the second half. A game you savor like a Netflix show that you can’t stop binge-watching.","As Dusk Falls is a captivating narrative-focused game that grounds itself in human experiences and captures the hallmarks of prestige TV with its acting, writing, and style. A true evolutionary experience in games.",,"If you're a fan of the genre, you'll probably have some fun with this, but it's hardly the revelation that the decision-based, narrative-driven genre feels like it so desperately needs.","We have a lot of gripes about As Dusk Falls, but we’ve still very much enjoyed our time with it. Its story will keep you hooked from start to finish, but some of its narrative gaps will leave you with questions. Should that keep you from playing? No – ultimately, this is a very well-executed narrative drama complete with excellent voice acting and a unique art style. Yes, it could have been better in many ways, but it’s still worthy of your time.","It ends up telling a story that brilliantly grapples with a lot of under-explored, or even unexplored, themes in video games. Like a lot of my favorite games, it left me with a lot to think about, such as the roles we choose or reject, the hardships we inescapably inherit from family, and how trauma casts a dauntingly long shadow, but how forgiveness, should we choose to show it, may just let the light in.",,"With As Dusk Falls, a new step is taken in the transformation of classic adventure games into ""narrative experiences"" intended for a general audience. The INTERIOR/NIGHT studio even pushes the cursor to reach the status of interactive photo-novel, due to a singular artistic direction, based essentially on still images.",,"As Dusk Falls tells a wonderful story that is not only thought provoking, but willing to discuss difficult subjects that aren’t often talked about. With every decision having an impact and putting the focus on characters, the story themes are effectively communicated and make you interested in seeing what happens next. Experiencing the game with your friends is also enjoyable, fostering discussions of your choices and what kind of decisions you make. While getting 100% completion for the game can be a tough journey, you are rewarded with story details that open up character motivations and keep you thinking about the characters long after you put down the game.",,,"As Dusk Falls is an interactive drama that soon becomes almost a virtual reality game. Its ability to put you in the skin of the characters is palpable and the story adapts to playstyle with a false sense of freedom, which little by little leads you to discover yourself in the most grotesque way possible.",,,,,,,"As Dusk Falls is a breathtaking story that explores life lived in the margins. An intricately plotted story means that most decisions feel consequential, and fantastic writing ekes empathy from the unlikeliest of places. Although the story loses some steam in the latter half, getting to the end of As Dusk Falls will reward players with 100 ‘what if’s’ and an itch to race back to the beginning to do it all over again.","With As Dusk Falls, Interior Night and Xbox Game Studios are testing the limits of what an interactive narrative adventure game can be. It's certainly odd for this to be one of the biggest Xbox exclusives of 2022, but it keenly demonstrates that there's still a lot that developers can do to innovate within a genre that seems limited at first glance.",,"As Dusk Falls comfortably exceeds the standard of its genre when it comes to plotting, characterisation, performance and the impressive malleability of the story. It’s a story about trauma and what it takes to overcome it, really; reluctant teen criminal Jay Holt stayed with me, particularly, touchingly innocent despite what he’s been exposed to in his life. Narrative games exist outside of gaming’s old technological arms race, now, and because we’re not focusing so much on how realistic they look, they’re free to tell much better stories.",,"As Dusk Falls is a valiant attempt to tell a good crime drama where actions have consequences. The story went on a lot longer than I expected, as the tense moments at the motel spawned a lot of different threads — both flash forwards and flashbacks — that I didn’t expect. But ultimately the tale failed to move me in the way that I had hoped for. The characters were caught in circumstances where they had nothing but bad choices, and it just made me think that the dumbest thing they did was to allow themselves to be caught in those circumstances. In that way, I don’t think the storytellers succeeded in created the empathy for characters on both sides of the events that they wanted. I would like to see more from this talented studio. But so far the story feels more like a TV show than a stellar movie, and more like a soap opera than a memorable drama.","As Dusk Falls isn’t quite the arty thinkpiece it aspires to be. But it’s a hell of a lot of fun nonetheless. This is a perfect Game Pass experience for a mellow weekend, and probably best enjoyed with an adult beverage in hand — and the company of your favorite like-minded sickos.",,,"As Dusk Falls represents a bold new future for interactive movie games - a future where games can do away with the supernatural spectacle and thrillery whodunnits to rely on human drama to entertain us instead. And OK, this does occasionally veer into soap opera, but at other times it's gentle and deep and dark, even profound. It shows how well games can handle stories and themes like these when done with care and understanding, and how well it can pull us into the lives of others and invest us in the decisions they have to make. And that's what really stays with me about the game: stories - human stories. They are the troubled, awkward and beautiful stories I can see in the world around me, that I can relate to myself. This is a game that reflects, in many ways, our own lives. Silly as it sometimes can be, As Dusk Falls feels real, and I can't think of a higher compliment to give it. [Eurogamer Recommended]",,"With its ability to constantly pull the rug out from under you, As Dusk Falls doesn’t fade into a forgettable narrative experience we’ve seen a thousand times. Instead, it leaves its mark, with a long shadow cast by its sad but understandable characters’ hardships drawn across threads seemingly made of jagged wire. What will haunt you is whether the thread you chose really was the best one at the time. As in life, the answer will likely be: probably not. [Polygon Recommends]","While it was a refreshing way to play a narrative-driven game, it’s not an entirely new idea. Supermassive’s 2017 thriller Hidden Agenda similarly turned a gritty drama into a party game. But I’m hopeful more games adopt a similar approach. In the case of As Dusk Falls, playing with my wife made what would have felt like a just-OK B-movie thriller plot into a much more memorable experience. There are a lot of branching paths, too, so we have a good excuse to return to the game.",,,"As Dusk Falls is an engrossing interactive crime drama with memorable characters. The art style and voice acting are great and the well-written, complex story branches out depending on your choices (which are meaningful, not illusory!), making the game worthy of replaying. I recommend giving As Dusk Falls a try instead of binge-watching a show on a streaming platform, but I suggest you launch the game early in the evening, because once you start it, it’s really hard to turn off the console until the end credits roll after 6-7 hours.",Its story engages from beginning to end and keeps the player interested in these characters whose lives fall into a spiral of chaos and self-destruction.

Something that, unfortunately, can happen to anyone. This narrative introduces us to a cast of morally gray characters who must make difficult decisions with repercussions that mark their lives and the lives of others. It thus explores how people process, cope with, or try to escape from trauma. As it is practically an interactive movie, it may bore those who are looking for action.

Unfortunately, however, it suffers the annualized production, matching the great realism and the excellent driving feeling with several flaws and too strong similarities with the previous episode in the series.","After its success with MotoGP 20, many have a lot of expectations about the new game of this championship. MotoGP 21 receives most of the game modes and options of the last game, but the physics makes this game much better and realistic. The racing experience feels renewed, and it could be the most important aspect of this game. We could say this because the graphics don't improve as much as could be expected for next-gen hardware. We can see some work in textures or global illumination, but most things are the same. It could be enough, thanks to the racing experience, but not for a stand-alone next-gen version. Maybe for MotoGP 22 if Milestone wants to work.",,,,"Disappointing ! Milestone was off to a good start with its pretty MotoGP 20, full of promise with finally a career mode worthy of the name. But instead of polishing it, the Italian studio has put the diamond in the next-gen's garage this season. MotoGP 21 is stagnating in the gameplay, the fault of the sets and animations still unchanged and quite dull, an AI that falls back into its faults causing too many accidents and the absence of a split screen mode. Worse, the title regresses in content, puts the historical mode to oblivion and brings no notable novelty to the career. Even the shimmering visual identity of MGP20 has given way to a dreary ersatz menu, enough to assure us of one thing: the next installment in the series will be expected around the corner.",,,,,"When all is said and done, Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139… brings a cult classic to a new generation of gamers.

In comparison to the previous one, the immersion was truly kicked up a notch and this gives a greatly improved experience that is less punitive and better-dosed.

call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war,"Sure, this latest COD does not break any ground for bringing a new and innovative COD title; however, when you look as the game as a whole, and realize that a major chunk of it was developed during a Pandemic where everyone was working remotely, and you can appreciate the title including the story, the multiplayer and the Zombies mode. Given all of this, you will probably be playing this title for quite some time given that there will be free content arriving in the future that enhances both the multiplayer and Zombies mode. If you are a Call of Duty fan, Black Ops Cold War is a decent addition to add to your game library. If you are a casual fan of the series, or even new to the franchise, then this game will still be something you can enjoy too.","I am more than a little surprised at just how much I enjoyed Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. Having skipped the series for a few years due to being a bit burnt out on it all, Cold War manages to feel fresh and exciting while familiar at the same time. The solo campaign is over too soon, but what’s there is excellent and offers more than a simple rollercoaster of action. Multiplayer is as solid as ever, with a great variety of modes to dip in to. The combat feel is still among the best out there, making even the worst defeats still enjoyable. Zombies has great potential if you’ve a crew to play with, and brings some welcome levity to proceedings. An excellent all round package then, and well worth a look.",,"Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War combines a bombastic campaign that desperately attempts to shoehorn as much classic CoD action as it can into its rather short running time, with a solid multiplayer suite that feels a little light on exciting new modes and content at launch. However, what's here is still undeniably fun, the campaign introduces a few neat ideas along the way and multiplayer has got its classic modes, the safety net of Warzone and returning Zombies chaos to fall back on, resulting in a Call of Duty offering that may not throw up any big surprises but manages to scrape a pass regardless.","With Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War on Xbox you get a hell of a lot of game for your money. It’s a game in which you could easily spend hundreds of hours in, and then you can throw Warzone on top. It's a great package and one that provides a thoroughly enjoyable campaign, a deep multiplayer mode, and tons of the usual Call of Duty theatrics.",,,,"Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is a decent entry in the series, but it feels like it doesn't quite know what it wants to be.

While still enjoyable, Black Ops Cold War fails to recapture the magic of Black Ops 1 and 2.",,,,"Raven Software and Treyarch bring us a complete and satisfying CoD package, with a spectacular - even if fragmented - Campaign and many multiplayer modes. The new Zombi mode feels finally fleshed out and more integrated to the rest of the game and competitive multiplayer is more balanced even if missing some of last year's features, but the classical modes' maps are too few and sometimes limited. All in all, a solid CoD episode capable of keeping us engaged until the next one.","Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War aims for a more classic experience within the sub-saga, after the previous experiments.

It doesn’t have the same invigorating revival as last year’s Modern Warfare, but that would be an impossible expectation.

nba-2k22,"NBA 2K22 is probably best entry that the series has seen in many years. On the court everything flows exactly as it should with many improvements from last year. Unfortunately, microtransactions are still rampant everywhere in the game, and to be able to compete online with your created character or in MyTeam you're almost forced to spend money if you actually want to be competitive. If you have skipped the series in the last year or two, it may be time to take a look now. It is not best of all time, but it has taken a very big step in the right by listening suggestions from its players.","While it may be generally the same game as last year, If you skipped out on last year’s edition of NBA 2K this may be the year for you.

My Career's new City area has been well implemented and could well be a huge timesink for those who are into that mode and, although there's no other major changes to speak of, what's here is undoubtedly still the slickest basketball ticket in town right now.","NBA 2K22 is a great basketball game. In fact it's probably the best basketball game out there and actually hitting the court and playing games is thrilling, exciting, and looks brilliant. And alongside that, MyNBA will eat away at your life; fantastically detailed and absorbing, while MyTEAM will cater to the many. It’s only MyCAREER which lets it down",,"NBA 2K22 returns with a new shooting system, gameplay that focuses on defense and several new game modes that will have you gripping the pad for hours.",,,,,,"NBA 2K22 brings major improvements to its gameplay, making it more balanced and suitable for all types of players, while also offering us a next-gen graphic rendering at the edge of photorealism.

The additions in MyCareer mode are surprising at first, but then become a bit of a drag.",,,"As solid as it’s ever been on the court, NBA 2K22 is still an astonishingly good sports game, but its continued reliance on cynical microtransactions in MyCareer and MyTeam leave a sour taste.","Immense in substance and respectable in form. 2K22 is worthy of the new generation of consoles, with gameplay and a career mode that erase the many faults of the past year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"By significantly improving the experience of an NBA game in terms of gameplay, sound and graphics, the game has never been so beautiful, exciting, immersive and realistic. With an oustanding amount of content and game modes, all of which are at least of high quality, it's impossible not to find something to enjoy. However, the big disappointment comes from My Career. The idea of interweaving it with the universe of The City technically seems pleasant and logical given the direction the studio has been taking for years. Unfortunately, the presence of outdated RPG mechanics and the inconsistencies of a career of an NBA star player correlated to a life simulation of a neighborhood player (even a ""legendary"" one) become more and more problematic and annoying as you go on. The experience even becomes exasperating despite a promising start and interesting story situations because of The City's environment which suffers from technical shortcomingsfurther ruining the immersion. In the future, truly separating the My Career and My Player modes would make it possible to enjoy the best of both worlds rather than persisting in this flawed marriage doomed to failure, if that's not too much to ask.",,,,,,,,,"Yes, this is still the best way to play a simulation of the beloved sport, but with each passing year it seems like there's less and less emphasis on the Basketball itself and most of the time and effort go to improving ""The City"" and the microtransactions filled ""MyTeam"".

It's an incredibly enjoyable game to play, even if the options surrounding the on-court action continue to be maddeningly inconsistent.",,"It appears that NBA 2K has finally started to take the “next step” into greater gaming possibilities. Though MyPlayer needs a good amount of tuning and streamlining before reaching the heights of past story modes, it hints at bigger things down the line.

The new play mechanics are excellent, and it continues to excel on the presentation front. The microtransactions are still super gross and I wish some of the other modes such as Blacktop would get a proper overhaul as they are starting to feel dated. Still being the only NBA game in town it does upgrade nicely. I found myself deleting the old version to play this one, and not being a huge NBA fan that is saying something.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As a big basketball fan and avid player of sports games, it’s hard not to have a love and hate relationship with the NBA 2K series, and NBA 2K22 is no exception. The basketball gameplay itself is as good as it’s ever been, and it genuinely feels satisfying to move the ball around, shoot, and play defense. However, modes like MyCareer are heavily bogged down by useless baggage, and a strong emphasis on microtransactions. Spotty servers mean that even the best parts of the game are often hard to enjoy. MyNBA is the only aspect of NBA 2K22 that provided a thoroughly enjoyable experience with practically nothing to complain about. NBA 2K22 gets in its own way, but there’s some genuinely great things there if you’re willing to endure it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sherlock-holmes-chapter-one,"I didn’t think that Sherlock Holmes Chapter One would be something I would initially gravitate towards, but I’ve been converted once I felt like a genius after solving my first case, wanting to know more about Sherlock, Jon and his mother’s passing. Not being forced to find one ‘correct’ solution to cases was a breath of fresh air and I was completely content with the ending I received. While it’s not episodic, I’m hoping to get some form of a Chapter Two someday, as I want to see how my Sherlock evolved into the legend.","Overall, if you like the world of Sherlock Holmes, enjoy a good investigative adventure, or have enjoyed any of the previous games in the series, either new or old, then Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is likely to be a game you will thoroughly enjoy. It has charm, wit, excitement, and plenty of harrowing crimes to chill you to the bone as you explore the picturesque locale of Sherlock’s childhood stomping ground. This is what I always want a Sherlock game to be.",,"There are a lot of things to admire in Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, and when it works, it all comes together in a fantastic new way. Unfortunately, there are far too many instances of clues that perhaps made sense to the team that made it, but not the player. Just when you start finding your stride, a roadblock appears as you struggle to figure out your next steps. The jump to an open-world setting ultimately feels unnecessary and adds to the confusion. Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is not a bad game at all, but the experimental gameplay feels like a missed opportunity that a sequel could perhaps refine.","Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is powered by a brilliant story and the chance to take in some superb cases. The ability to get accusations wrong and to choose whether to save or condemn is a solid touch that allows the game to deliver a great dynamic. There are a ton of hours included here too, with a huge main story and loads of side quests to take in.",,Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One brings us a young Sherlock Holmes in an open world adventure that will have you glued to your seat solving mysteries for a long time.,,,,,,"Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is a good (re)starting point for the famous detective's video game saga. The mysteries this time are a bit easier, but there are many more contents than usual thanks to the new open-world approach even if the new features would have used a little more development. All in all, the new direction of Sherlock Holmes is definitely the right one and we're eager to see where it will lead in the future.",,"Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One deviates little from the established Frogwares detective game template, but that doesn't stop it from being a compelling adventure and perhaps one of the studio's stronger games overall. It's got a meaty and intriguing core story, loads to see and do off the main path, and some swerving cases that will take some serious sleuthing to come to the right conclusions — I'm not sure what more you could really ask for from a game like this besides that tried-and-tested trifecta, except maybe a little more polish. The lack thereof doesn't hurt the game too much, mind, so if you enjoy solving crimes while being really, really, really ridiculously good-looking, this mid-price mystery should definitely find its way onto your wishlist.",,"Quite possibly developer Frogwares’ most accomplished crack at the iconic detective yet, Sherlock Holmes Chapter One combines a compelling story, detailed world, and involving investigation mechanics to great effect.","For its ambitious prequel, Frogwares relied on an open world that enjoys a rather generous scope for a wide range of surveys. These also give the game a very solid lifespan. On the other hand, the proposal proves difficult to measure up on a technical level, with slowdowns, rigid animations and clipping in support. More engaging in its second part, Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One offers progressive dynamism and a commendable conclusion. The heart of the adventure lies in its clues to be connected and the accusations to be made, which follow a pattern of investigation which, however, runs out of steam too quickly.","If you love the detective genre, then you will adore the challenge that awaits. With some interesting and bizarre crimes to solve, colourful characters and vivid era-specific imagery, it’s a treat for the senses. However, even with all these positives, it was missing something! I can’t ignore the rinse and repeat character models, the rehash of many scenarios, and the lack of interaction. It left me wanting more, as I could see its potential. Despite its shortcomings, I recommend you to buy it.","Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One seeks to innovate by making the gameplay more free and complete. Truth to be told some technical limitations, still the game remains a pleasant experience without highs.",,,,,"Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is a title that comes excruciatingly close to achieving greatness. When you are in the midst of one of the many mysteries that Cordona Island holds, cracking cases and soaking in Frogwares’ fantastic writing, Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is up there with the best the series has to offer. Unfortunately, performance issues hold back the open-world exploration to an extent that drags the overall experience down. Nevertheless, even with the technical drawbacks, the main gameplay loop of cracking cases and solving puzzles is stronger than ever and well worth the price of admission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sherlock Holmes Chapter One presents an interesting set of mysteries to solve, but its open-world setting doesn’t really elevate its familiar investigation gameplay to a substantial enough degree, and its combat sections are uniformly dull and repetitive. There are certainly bursts of satisfaction to be earned when you get on a roll with an inquiry, but too often the vague case criteria can cause your sleuthing to stall and force you to fall back on guesswork, while the annoyingly unhelpful advice from Jon only makes these moments feel all the more frustrating. Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is a decent detective game set in an open-world that’s a bit too elementary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This is one of the best detective titles you’ll play and its story and voice-acting is a pure joy. Just don’t go in expecting any high level of visual sheen, or system fluidity.",,,,,,,,"Despite these issues, it's difficult not to get sucked into Chapter One's web of intrigue. The central mystery is uneventful until its final moments, but the cases surrounding it are consistently excellent, and the role you play in solving them is incredibly gratifying. The open world is more of a backdrop than anything else, but it expands the game with dozens of side cases that are just as alluring as those found in the main story. Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One may stumble at times, but it scratches that investigative itch like few games even attempt to.",,,,,,,,,,,"It wasn’t easy following the extraordinarily ambitious The Sinking City, yet Sherlock Holmes Chapter One takes some of the best ideas of its predecessor and builds on them, combining it with Frogware’s experience with the Sherlock Holmes universe. The result is a game that can feel very rigid and linear at times but excels in the deep and emotional exploration of Sherlock Holmes as a character. The game is full of interesting and memorable cases, even if player decisions and agency barely matter. This game lives in the legacy of old adventure games like the Broken Sword series and if understood as such, this is a wonderful modern adventure game.",,,"If you’re keen to test your cerebral matter then Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One will delight frequently. Occasionally clunky it may be, it’s still hugely satisfying and offers some compelling cases to solve. There’s some work to be done to make this the definitive Sherlock Holmes game but for now, revel in its wonders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I need a little more hand holding than Sherlock Holmes Chapter One gives. I’m not as smart as Sherlock, and found myself bumbling around at times like a lost child. When I was in the zone I was having a good time. The variety of costumes made for a fun time, and the eavesdropping mini game were a good distraction to a worthwhile story. The game has flaws, but those can easily be overlooked with a mountain of fun and interesting mysteries to solve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I’ve played a few Sherlock games before and really enjoyed them. Chapter One has exceeded all expectations and made the bar very high for all future installments. It’s one of the best games I played this year! Being in an open world and solving cases is pure bliss. At least for people who like crime and solving cases. Don’t let the price fool you, this is a full game with tons of awesome content. It’s just a bonus that it costs less than the average AAA title. When it’s called Chapter One, it gives the impression there are more installments planned. But because technically it’s more of a prequel of sorts, it very well could be by itself and the name could just represent the timeline. I would be thrilled if there are more chapters, especially with the last scene of the game being so exciting. If there’s any indication this version of Sherlock will continue, count me in.",,,,
powerwash-simulator,,,,"It's a really chill addition to Xbox Game Pass that you'll likely end up enjoying a lot if you're into this sort of thing, while others will inevitably think it's boring and too repetitive.

With many areas to clean, plenty of cash to earn, and new equipment to buy, you are spoilt for choice.

Alone or with friends it’s both fun and stupidly satisfying to clean dirt with water. A healthy variety of locations, tools, a solid upgrade path, and even new looks are on hand to make this one well worth checking out.",,"Powerwash Simulator is a very zen game. I lost hours of my life just spraying away doing something that felt menial but scratched an itch I didn’t even know I had. This game isn’t for everyone, though. If you don’t find cleaning relaxing, or have issues with finer details, don’t play this. But if you give it a shot, you’ll find a game that is the perfect wind-down game after a long, stressful day.",,,,,,,,,"PowerWash Simulator is a game for people who love a clean space. It’s a meditation for those who need a stress-free break. The gameplay is easy and straightforward, the controls handle beautifully, and the colors jump out with vibrance and life. I do feel like the game is hurt with such a soft delivery on its story and lack of soundtrack. The dirt highlighter could also benefit from multiple color options. I feel that the requirements on smaller objects and crevices could use some tweaking. I love booting this up for some relaxing gameplay. It’s easily one of my favorite games to play on Xbox.",,,,"Cleaning is so much fun when it isn't in real-life, you just wash away all these feelings and feel better when playing PowerWash Simulator. Thank you FuturLab for an amazing game.",,,,,,,,,,"Power Wash Simulator is a darling escape into a profession I never knew I had any passion for. I’m not saying I’m about to quit writing and start going to town on my nan’s filthy patio, but there’s something about living a distant occupation through the medium of video games that pulls you in and refuses to let go.",,PowerWash Simulator's simple yet therapeutic style of gameplay provides an enjoyable way to chill out across its numerous generously sized levels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The racing in MX vs. ATV Legends is especially fun to experience in first-person, thanks to the varied courses. The downside, however, is that the game disappoints in many areas. For example, it is full of visual issues, bugs and glitches. In addition, the AI is very unstable and the carrier mode feels a bit empty and mindless. A game that certainly has potential, but where currently not everything is exploited.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"When PowerWash Simulator leans into its best qualities, as a soothing and low-impact way to pass some time, it shines like the chrome on a recently power-washed classic car. On the rare occasions when it breaks up its own flow with granular fussiness or interrupts your plans for the in-game economy, it detracts from the experience. At its best, PowerWash Simulator is a quiet, relaxing experience that's best enjoyed in small doses. It's time-consuming, yes, but once in a while, we all need something to consume our time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"PowerWash Simulator is just a comfort game for me and I can see myself playing this for months to come. There is something extremely satisfying about its progression. Playing with friends is a blast and I just love zoning out and making slow progress. These simulation games are getting wild and this is by far the one to click with me. It had me searching prices of power washers in real life, so mission accomplished I supposed developers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There were times while playing that I felt the zen of cleaning, my mind cleared by the soothing sound of water as it steadily droned on or changed pitch while moving between different surfaces. There’s also a certain sense of satisfaction that comes with transforming some grossly dirty areas into the pristine places that they were meant to be. However, there were plenty of times when the simulated work felt like real work. Spending over ten minutes walking slowly back and forth across a driveway to finally get it clean and then looking up and seeing how far you have to go to get the rest of the home clean can be both frustrating and disheartening. The relaxing moments provided by the game were simply outnumbered by those that became more and more tedious by the sheer number of large surfaces that must be cleaned in the game. You can easily spend an evening cleaning somebody else’s home for them, and then look back and think that you could have spent the limited time you have for relaxation and entertainment more wisely.",,"I’m conflicted when it comes to PowerWash Simulator. On one hand, it’s an absolute bore and a chore with one-dimensional gameplay – can I even call it gameplay? – but on the other, it’s still strangely fun and moreish, and seeing the grime trickle away and the percentage done counter ticking slowly upwards was enough to keep me wasting water for hours on end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gunfire-reborn,"Gunfire Reborn was fun to play alone, but it shined when I was playing with someone, almost as if it really was meant to be played alongside with a friend. Gunfire Reborn shines in some aspects, and not so much in others, but it is definitely worth a try if you have Xbox Game Pass, especially if you can get someone else to join you. It may not be game changing, but with smooth satisfying gunplay and an expansive build system, there is a lot to explore in Gunfire Reborn.",,,,"Gunfire Reborn may not set the world on fire, but it is capable of delivering a damn good time to anyone that fancies a rogue-lite arcade experience - especially if that person is after plenty of loot or the chance to enjoy RPG elements.",,"Gunfire Reborn comes to our consoles to bring us a first-person shooter with procedural dungeons.

Pre-order lock out nonsense aside, this is a fantastic way to experience the classics.",,"If you can make peace with a few missing options and don't mind the paid DLC aspect you'll still have a great time here, and if you're coming to these games fresh you're in for an almighty treat, it's just a shame that SEGA has chosen to sully the endeavour with unnecessary greed and a few glaring functional omissions that could so easily have been included. So there you have it, Sonic Origins has got it where it counts but a little more TLC would have seen our score bumped up by a few points. Maybe next time, SEGA.","Fully remastered with a lot of extras, SEGA have achieved their goal of making Sonic Origins the best way to play the classics going forward.",,Sonic Origins could be THE Sonic compilation if only it would offer a wider variety of titles.

Perhaps one of the most striking flaws is that Sonic 3 does not include its original soundtrack.",,,"While it's almost impossible not to have fun with Sonic Origins, it is easy to lament the missing features, neutered Sonic 3 soundtrack, and absence of the blue blur's outings on the Master System and Game Gear. Disappointing.","Although it is a nice homage to the first adventures of the hedgehog, Sonic Origins could have deserved a better finish. Overall, this compilation is correct, but the options offered are not enough to make up for certain shortcomings. Despite a really successful dressing with its cartoons and colorful interface, SEGA's game constantly oscillates between good and bad. We're having a good time, but for Sonic's 30th anniversary, we were right to expect more games and surprises. Especially at a price of forty euros.",,,,,"While Sonic Origins does little to innovate or make this set of ports stand out besides some forgettable Museum unlockables and some nice new artwork, it remains a perfectly fine addition to the accessibility of classic Sonic games on modern consoles.

I grew up with 2D platformers and my Mega Drive with games is now well protected in a glass cabinet in the living room. Accordingly, I approached Sonic Origins with hope. Sega would have had the chance to interest younger players and offer old fans a little added value. But they missed it cleanly. For new players, 40 euros for four old games will be too much. At the same time, the collection offers almost nothing new for fans. Sure, the scans of the old manuals and developer sketches are nice, but they are nothing more than some fluff on top. The versions of the games work good on Xbox Series and still play fantastically, but they are only warmed up and nothing here is original from the Mega Drive.

Of course, if you don't like puzzles, this is not your game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Call of the Sea’s intriguing piecemeal story and beautiful setting falls to the wayside when its lack of signposting and overall artificially obtuse puzzles take center stage for much longer than acceptable.,,,,,,,"Out of the Blue's debut game manages to pack in some complex puzzles set amongst some beautiful environments, and has a story that keeps you hooked throughout.",,,"With a style reminiscent of the great classics, it left a great taste in my mouth.",,,,"Call of the Sea is an interesting but flawed experiment, denoting some (legitimate) error of inexperience. In general, the feeling is that of an adventure written in a pleasant and moderately enjoyable way to play, without ever reaching that status of a little gem to be discovered that in the past months had accompanied the arrival of the debut title. of Out of the Blue from Madrid. A non-trivial story that leaves good feelings for the future of the Spanish studio, to be enjoyed without too many pretensions towards a rather inspired ending.","What a surprise Call of the Sea was! Out of the Blue’s debut title shows off its own well-defined personality through a very accurate artistic direction and attention to details. All puzzles have their own logic and the idea of proposing them in blocks, separating the adventure into sealed chapters, helps to focus attention on a limited number of elements. With its crazy atmosphere and an eight-hours duration, which prevents any kind of fatigue, Call of the Sea is a highly recommended game for adventure’s (and Lovecraft’s) lovers.",,,"Call of the Sea is a well written game with some flaws when it comes to its puzzles: overall, a fine experience that is surely worth a try.",,,"Call Of The Sea is a good debut, that uses puzzle and riddle-based gameplay to tell an atmospheric story. Its weakness lies in a conception of riddles that is not always very clear, source of some moments of frustration, and in a limited duration. It will probably not remain among the most notable examples of the genre, but we must give credit to the fact that it manages to offer an alternative vision of the Lovecraftian narrative universe, potentially capable of satisfying those who do not always want monsters or scares.",,"Intriguing and fascinating, Call of the Sea is a worthy new addition to Xbox Game Pass.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Call of the Sea is proof that “Lovecraft” doesn’t have to mean “darkness and tentacles”. This is a positive, sometimes even cheerful adventure and it’s only the undertones which are ominous, and that works surprisingly well. Also, the puzzles are great, as are the graphics and the quietly moving story.","With a gripping, well-paced story that isn't afraid to delve into the realm of surreal and weird, Call of the Sea is an adventure title that's sure to please fans of the genre. You won't feel like the next Einstein when completing its puzzles, and the love story won't bring you to tears, but there's something charming about it for that very reason. It's a concise, seven-hour journey that progresses at a steady rate without ever overstaying its welcome.","It is a delightful indie game. They have known how to choose each tool to create an adventure of exploration, mystery and with a variety of puzzles that will undoubtedly leave you hooked.","Call of the Sea struggles to maintain its momentum as it nears the end of the game in terms of gameplay, but the first few chapters are great and the story at least stays interesting. While its short length may understandably make some hesitant to buy it outright, it's an easy recommendation for Xbox Game Pass subscribers, especially anyone looking for a fresh experience on their Xbox Series X consoles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Call of the Sea gives that warm, almost nostalgic feeling of wonder. This six-hour puzzle adventure is filled to the brim with beautiful environments, occult mystery and unexpected plot twists. As a player you get the feeling that you have rediscovered a long forgotten fairy tale. But be warned: Call of the Sea plays anything but smooth and requires a lot of patience.","If the writers weren't so eager to spoil their own surprises, I think we'd be looking at one outstanding narrative-driven adventure here. As it is, Call of the Sea is a pleasing piece of pulp fiction and a decent test of your puzzle-solving skills.",,,"When all was said and done, it was a great journey — I just don’t understand why the developers went to such great lengths to make taking that journey as irritating and inconvenient as possible.",,,,"We get a story whose late twists are telegraphed within the first hour or so, and an ending drenched with homage to the Shape of Water. The journey, however, is worth taking. I relished the spectacle of a stranded ship, its hull gashed with Godzilla-sized claw marks. And, in the wavering depths of a dream sequence, Norah swimming down towards a pair of glowing eyes. Still, that sort of thing is par for the course, when you’re in Lovecraftland. What rescues the game from the descent into cliché isn’t a rise to sanity. Nor is it the call of the sea. It’s Harry. You believe in Norah because she believes in him, and even when the plot goes bats you want to see them back together. Who would have thought that the solution to madness might be marriage? Thanks, Old Pal.","Like any good puzzle game, there is special satisfaction in working out a solution to a conundrum that has stumped you, and that’s the best reward in the game. Call of the Sea ramps up the story towards the end, but I cared far more about the clues than Norah and Harry’s tale. It frustrates as the best puzzles often do, but no solutions feel unearned or gimmicky. This is definitely one for the pencil-chewers to check out.",,,,,,A dazzlingly different debut with a haunting sense of place and adventure.

It is a relaxed puzzle adventure, suitable for all types of players and that invites, through its careful artistic section, to be enjoyed calmly. I think it has the foundation to be a great game, makes some brave decisions and tells a peculiar story. However, I feel that it has been too restrained, that it could have given something more of itself in terms of duration and difficulty, but the truth is that I really want to see what will be next in Out of the Blue [Recommended]",,,,,,,,,"Call of the Sea is an enjoyable adventure. The story and setting are refreshingly different from what you’ll find in other games this season, and the puzzles are challenging enough to require some thought but not so much so to be frustrating. If you enjoy puzzles, you’ll enjoy your trip to the South Pacific.","Call of the Sea is basically one big escape room, in which you go from location to location while solving varied and mostly interesting puzzles. Sometimes, however, developer Out of the Blue expects a little too much, which can lead to frustrating moments and a wandering player.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Call of the Sea is one of the better Lovecraftian games in recent memory, thanks to its art, writing, acting and subtle defiance of some well-worn mystery conventions. In general, its puzzles are accessible yet challenging and the story is well told and set in a refreshingly unfamiliar environment. Less passive than a typical walking simulator but still not an action game, The Call of the Sea should appeal to gamers that appreciate beautiful art and an engrossing mystery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Call of the Sea will be welcomed by those who enjoy a challenging puzzle game with a matinee feel of familiarity and extravagance.

asterigos-curse-of-the-stars,"Asterigos: Curse of the Stars is quite approachable even given its Soulslike mechanics, and with my first playthrough finishing at just over 15 hours or so, I started up New Game+ right away to get back into Hilda’s world. For a newer developer, Acme Gamestudio has crafted a wonderful world with plenty of content, replayability and quite polished for the most part, not something I’d expect from a $45 (CDN) title or from a studio's first major release.",,,,"Asterigos: Curse of the Stars is an RPG that comes with great ideas, fun gameplay, and some brilliant boss battles. I like the fact you can choose your difficulty level, so this will certainly appeal to those looking for something aside from a hardcore Souls-like.

In short, we could say that this Souls-like is made for all those who love the genre along with a classic mythology that can attract a large audience.",,,,,"Asterigos: Curse of the stars: is a Souls-lite title that is fun, rewarding, and challenging. Furthermore, it has a fascinating story, and interesting characters, and is reasonably long. What's more, the atmospheric audio and fantastic environments make for a wonderful and fulfilling experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,"As an action-RPG, Asterigos: Curse of the Stars offers a sensational experience. Whether in terms of story and combat gameplay, this rich AA production is more than generous. Unfortunately, the level design struggles to be convincing and clearly tarnishes the general experience. As regards the technical aspect, the AA production status and the usual lack of means it implies might explain why some corners were cut. However, the gameplay experience remains pleasant and the story and gameplay largely make up for the shortcomings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An action-RPG without unnecessary frills, perhaps a bit anonymous and derivative, but with ideas capable of creating sparkling and noteworthy gameplay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With Asterigos: Curse of the Stars it can often feel like you’re doing one step forward and two steps back. The game has its moments of brilliance, both in gameplay and presentation, but often stumbles along the way. The combat feels satisfying, but the flexibility offered through the six different fighting styles is quickly limited through expensive upgrades and weapon-specific skill trees. Similarly while the game offers some cinematic and downright impressive views, especially during some of the bossfights, the vast majority of the Roman and Greek inspired city feels empty and repetitive, making exploration more of a chore than a highlight. Overall the lows and highs hold each other in balance, offering an enjoyable but mostly forgettable experience that, thanks to its solid combat, still counts among the better re-interpretations of the Dark Souls formula.",,,,,,,"Asterigos is a weird game in that it feels like it was so close to being excellent. The weird mix of mechanics do not gel well and parts of the game simply feel unfinished. Still it is a fun romp that could get much better with some patches and tweaks. I think the team behind it did a great job for their first game and hope they continue to get chances to make more. There are good ideas and characters here, it just feels like it needed more time or a bigger budget to reach their vision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Too bad we can't say the same about its online multiplayer gameplay, which can feel almost unplayable due to the delay-based netcode. All in all, this would be an advised buy only if you're planning alone or in local multiplayer.",,,,"As a vibrant and energetic revamp of a nine-year-old fighting game, JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure All-Star Battle R succeeds in breathing new life into something quite niche, with meaningful tweaks to its fighting system, new features, and more, giving it a well deserved second chance.","With its fan-service and multiple references, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure All-Star Battle R is above all dedicated to the community keen on the work of Hirohiko Araki. A pampered remaster of the eponymous title from the PlayStation 3 toy library, it offers an impressive cast and gameplay that is as technical as it is dynamic. If the balance of forces is not optimal (some characters are much more powerful than others), CyberConnect2's game has enough assets to convince fighting enthusiasts.

Unless you're primarily an online player, this is well worth checking out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fighting games are living in a resurgent time so it is awesome to see this game get a second lease on life. Having never played it, it was a pleasant surprise that is packed with a ton of solo content to keep me interested. This is all without having any attachment to the anime or characters themselves. It made me interested in the universe and I had a blast playing the game on all fronts.

It’s not often you’ll find me raving about a near-perfect horror game but for me, this one may well be up there for me as one of the best horror titles available hands down, and without a doubt one of the best titles of 2022.",,,"MADiSON is a pretty great first-person horror adventure.

Sadly Monster Energy Supercross 5 doesn’t offer enough that I’d recommend dropping launch price cash on, however it’s well worth checking out when a sale drops.

evil-west,"There is something old fashioned about Evil West, in many ways. It’s linear narrative, brutal combat and simple dialogue - all remind me of the Xbox 360 era, and this isn’t a bad thing by any means. Sometimes you don’t need all the best graphics, or an open world with a million tasks and quests, because sometimes you just want to beat bad guys up. Evil West gave me that, and cowboys and vampires too.",Evil West was recommended to me months back as a potential blockbuster. A game set in the Wild West where you are a monster hunter that you can play with a friend sounds pretty awesome. It delivers all of that with an interesting storyline that feels quite Van Helsing at times and stunning graphics. The linear layout coincidental traversal of maps is a very retro way of playing a game now but I quite enjoy it as that simplicity is quite refreshing at times but could be repetitive for others.,,"Evil West is a thoroughly old-fashioned shooter that manages to entertain in short bursts but can't overcome how lacklustre and unoriginal its level design and narrative feels. If you've got a pal to play through this one with in co-op you could probably stick another star on the final score, otherwise we'd steer clear unless you absolutely must indulge in some seriously last-gen cowboy vs. vampire action.","There is not a dull moment to be found in Evil West’s ten to twelve hour playtime. The storyline has the potential to ensure this could well turn into a massive franchise, and there’s just hope that any sequel may place more focus on cooperative play.","The variety in areas and monsters are its strong points, with the combat offering good fun with controversial choices. Its big problem is the lack of rhythm in its gameplay, as a result of which the title passes as an indifferent ""binge watch"" for the weekend.","The wild west brings very fun vibes but graphically outdated action. Evil West is the perfect definition of linear gameplay. For better and for worse. That said, it offers absolutely brutal action.",,,,,Evil West is a must play title for fans of action-adventure games that want a solid narrative with even better combat.,,"Evil West is a really fun third-person action game. It has a good variety of gameplay with the addition of melee and ranged gameplay. Plus, the artwork feels really inspired. Technically, however, it's a bit of a low-key game, and suffers from a severe problem in the level design.","Evil West feels like a fresh take on the typical 'Old West' settings we see, offering a satisfying combat system and enough gore to sate the appetite of the most bloodthirsty of vampires. Its dark narrative and compelling characters are both engaging, but some questionable level design choices hamper the experience a little in places. There is no doubt, though, that Evil West should be played by anyone with a love for the Western setting and occult references. In good cowboy fashion, this is a tale filled with sadness, pain, action, and perseverance through adversity, and it does a damn good job of it.",,,,"Evil West is a fantasy adventure game set in a grim and sinister world.

Its clever mechanics and designs outweigh my niggles with the physics and overworld map, though they aren’t to be discounted entirely. As a game to unwind with after a long day, this is a great pick up, and a good example of the kind of game Game Pass suits to a tee.","So far, I’ve had a blast with the game’s single-player. The tracks are fun and creative, the concept is simple but effective, and I still feel like I’m mastering the game’s mechanics.

Coupled with the creepy unnerving undertones of the story this game is not for the faint-hearted.",,"While Echo Generation stumbles a few times, our time with the game was never squandered.

isonzo,"Easily my favorite in the series, Isonzo offers class based and slow paced World War I gameplay that surely takes some getting used to, but is also a very unique experience compared to other shooters in the genre. The verticality of the level design of cliffside battles and unique classes is what keeps me coming back for one more onslaught on the battlefield, even if the map variety is a bit low and only having a single mode can be tiresome at times. While Isonzo may not have the polish and same experience of a top shelf AAA shooter, it’s quite clear to see that it’s a labor of love and passion from a smaller team that aims to bring a historically accurate representation of WWI combat that should appeal to its specific niche audience.","Isonzo commits to the WW1-era faithfully, with the pro’s and con’s that come with dealing with that time periods battles. I enjoyed the slower pace and more methodical approach to combat and objective capturing, and hope to see it continue to build a community of players willing to invest the time into the long battles.",,"All in all, Isonzo is very good at what it sets out to do, which is provide an authentic WW1 battlefield for players to experience, this time way up in the Italian Alps. The series' new setting does add some nice visual variety to proceedings, and the extra verticality has a pretty major impact on gameplay and match flow, but ultimately, we would like a little more meat on the bone, whether that be more online modes, gameplay options or even a single player campaign one day. What's here though is bloody brutally brilliant, and if you enjoy a more tactical approach to online warfare, Isonzo is definitely worth a shot - just remember to rechamber that rifle!","As much as you can when you find yourself replaying the Great War, Isonzo can be enjoyable. The realistic and authentic attention to detail and area focus is something to be admired, yet it is much harder than any other shooter, as you try to come to terms with tactics and the careful nature of war.",,A great and realistic way to disguise the WW1 on a multiplayer shooter. Isonzo is the best of WW1 Game Series.,,,,,,"Isonzo is a historically accurate WW1 shooter, with slow and long battles to conquer a few meters of the battlefield. Definitely an improvement over the previous games of the series, but it still needs some refinements and fixes, especially in balance and variety, to really be an unmissable game.","Isonzo is a multiplayer game with a solid proposal that has some problems. In relation to its realism, the beauty of its landscapes, the wildness of its confrontations, you have a game that can give you a lot. Although it is a niche game. The main problems that Isonzo WW1 has, besides some technical issues such as the texture overload or the horrible and screeching screams of dying men that sound out of tune, have to do with the design of its offensives. In my opinion, these confrontations can last longer than they should.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Primarily aimed at a niche audience wishing to immerse themselves in the conflicts of the First World War and indulge in a realistic and demanding gameplay, Isonzo could still appeal to neophytes of the genre. The immersion in the battles is successful, notably thanks to the quality sound design. As long as our team makes the best use of the different classes’ abilities, the confrontations are quite enjoyable. However, one will have to overlook the outdated technical aspect that could put some people off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
call-of-duty-vanguard,"Did Call of Duty Vanguard turn me into a fan of PvP shooters, no it didn’t, but I am certainly glad I played it and am looking forward to playing some more Zombies with friends once it launches for everyone. I loved the campaign though, as well as the four operatives, and Monaghan was just terrific. The visuals, sound mixing and score were also top notch in every way.",,"Call of Duty: Vanguard sometimes strains under the pressure of fulfilling its obligations to the all-consuming Warzone platform that the series has become. Vanguard’s Gunsmith and Operators might dictate the game’s World War II fiction in weird and hilarious ways, but it can still offer the same thrills you’d expect. Still, there’s no denying that Vanguard feels like a watered down entry for the franchise, which is now more motivated by microtransactions than by telling a compelling World War II narrative.","It may sound like we're being a bit down on this year's Call of Duty, but it's only because we know the franchise has potential. Warzone has proved it with multiplayer and Black Ops Cold War showcased it with its campaign. We hoped this would build upon those foundations, but instead it steps back into familiar territory. It's not a bad game by any means - in fact, even at its worst it's better than most first-person shooters out there - but as the games industry evolves, it's time for Call of Duty to bring something new to the table, and this isn't it.","So, Call of Duty: Vanguard. The campaign is great, the multiplayer is fun and Zombies will appeal to previous fans. As an overall package Vanguard is capable of providing hours of fun - all pushed along with brilliant visuals. This is a great trip back to World War II.",,"Vanguard has one of the best campaigns of the series and a very fun multiplayer. However, a boring Zombies mode and other technical problems make it below the level of the previous ones.",,,"Call of Duty: Vanguard's campaign and multiplayer are serviceable enough, but nothing exceptional for the series, while Zombies is disappointingly limited in scope and ideas.",,,"Call of Duty: Vanguard is a full CoD package with all the series' traditional modes, but with evident compromises made to release the game on-time. The campaign is short and not so memorable, the multiplayer has major balancing problems and several shortcomings compared to the other chapters, while the Zombie mode offers little bite. It's still a good shooter, but it lacks the punch and the breadth of content that distinguished the best episodes in the series.",,,,"We'll be damned if this isn't another fine Call of Duty game. The solo campaign is excellent, multiplayer delivers on practically all fronts, and Zombies provides a neat co-op diversion. Call of Duty: Vanguard represents great value, and enough new stuff to warrant taking a look.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Call of Duty Vanguard offers meaningful elements, especially in multiplayer thanks to a large number of varied and well-constructed maps. However, the TTK is far too low and the SBMM is abysmal. The campaign has some nice assets with some fun missions, allowing us to experience various conflicts of the Second World War. However, it’s a shame that the storytelling’s quality is not as good as it could be, but the visual one manages to bring the game up to par. As regards the Zombie mode, it will have to be disregarded, at least until new content is added. As it stands, the mode is sorely lacking in interest. Overall, Call of Duty Vanguard won’t be a landmark in the series, but it should still keep fans entertained until next year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Call of Duty: Vanguard proves that the franchise has done almost everything it can do without breaking out of its shell and trying something vastly different.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vanguard not only brings a whole lot more launch content and improvements than previous Call of Duty titles, by dint of a superior multiplayer experience, a solid and spectacular campaign and a more accessible but just as fun zombie mode.",,,,,Quotation forthcoming.,,,,,,,,,,"Call of Duty: Vanguard will get better with time, but the launch game is still an impressive package. The Campaign is short but sweet and the Multiplayer is a blast, though Zombies fans will likely come away disappointed. Even with Zombies failing to live up to expectations, though, Call of Duty: Vanguard still has a lot to offer fans of the franchise and is very much worth the price of admission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The biggest problem is CoD: Vanguard feels like the least innovative Call of Duty in years. I think a lot of that has to do with Warzone, and the fact that developers HAVE to ensure that their game can be compatible with that battle royale. The fact that so much has to go into making sure it all works together; I just feel like it has to be hampering the developer’s creativity. In my opinion Call of Duty as a whole need to take a year off and regroup, come back with something as memorable as the original Modern Warfare was when it launched. If it’s a matter of money (and I doubt that it is) developers could lean into Warzone, they already are making a killing on all the microtransactions but just update Warzone like Epic does for Fortnite. Then after a year surprise people with something fantastic… I know this will never happen, but a man can dream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Call of Duty: Vanguard unabashedly apes the style of 2019's Modern Warfare, with a multiplayer that is fun though familiar, but featuring a campaign that largely misses the mark.","Call of Duty: Vanguard is another solid entry in the popular franchise, but far from an excellent one. The campaign struggles in the story department, but a good base of multiplayer options and a fun, if under developed, Zombies mode help save the day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
steelrising,"Steelrising is easily Spider’s most ambitious work and I can’t applaud them enough for the unique setting and backdrop, even if the core mechanics are what we’ve experienced dozens of times before. There is of course a steep learning curve in the beginning, but anyone with ample Souls experience should feel right at home. Thankfully you don’t have to ‘Git Gud’ to enjoy Steelrising to completion even as a casual fan, as long as you don’t mind disabling achievements.","Steelrising is a Souls-like game based on automatons which tries its best not to be a clone drone. The historical setting, outfits and graphics are very immersive and interesting. The combat is challenging and given enough time quite easy to master. The bosses could have done with being a bit harder and the platforming elements need more work. But it’s still a very sizeable game with plenty to enjoy. I do wish they had some stronger background music to help with the historical immersion.","Steelrising is a new Souls-like twist on the French Revolution that unfortunately doesn’t see all of its lofty ambitions grow into accomplishments. While its gameplay is enjoyable once you get far enough to earn some unlocks and get main character Aegis more decked out, it tries to mimic elements of FromSoftware’s action RPG classics without always understanding what made said elements work. When Spiders leans less on taking inspiration from other games and more on presenting its own ideas, we get an intriguing—and surprisingly deep—alternate take on an important moment in France’s history.","Steelrising is a super solid soulslike that incorporates a wonderfully unique setting and lots of well-designed battle and traversal mechanics into the mix. There's tons of lovely little details in the world and characters here and the combat is addictive, crunchy stuff that gives you lots of cool weapons to toy around with. The story may not be the strongest, it all takes a while to get going properly and the scraps can get a little rough around the edges from time to time, but overall this is an impressive new entry in the genre that fans should absolutely make some time to check out.","Steelrising is a good game that puts itself in the AA bracket of gaming rather than the AAA settings of a Dark Souls or Elden Ring. But what it does do well is deliver an original concept, an amazing setting and a place occupied by killer robots.",,The automatas of the French Revolution surprise with a souls-like above expectations.,,,"Despite its flaws, Steelrising will reward those who give it the time. It's fun to explore, with a rewarding combat system and quality-of-life features that'd be welcomed in more soulslikes. While its easier difficulty and rough presentation may drive away some Dark Souls veterans, there's plenty on offer when overlooking its faults.",,"Steelrising has bits and pieces of a successful souls-like RPG, but fails to polish its mechanics and overall visuals enough to keep players hooked.",,"Steelrising is a good soulslike game, even if the AI of the enemies is a bit uneven in its behaviour. With a really fantastic setting, thanks to the dystopian Paris of 1789, a complete RPG system and a good combat system, Steelrising is a good alternative to From Software's games.",,,,"Without ever excelling or establishing itself as a new benchmark in the genre, Steelrising is a completely solid Souls-like that is sure to please fans of Dark Souls and Elden Ring. Yes, there are pros and cons everywhere! The technique is behind but the artistic direction wins hands down. The action phases are enjoyable but lack challenge at the end of the adventure. The level design of the various areas is quite academic but works well. Despite everything, we quickly get carried away by this demanding action game, tinged with robots, French Revolution and History. If the atmosphere speaks to you and you like Elden Ring, you can go there without hesitation.",,,"Steelrising is a mix of decent-to-damned-good parts that takes the Soulslike Action RPG and puts it into one of the most ridiculous and awesome settings I’ve seen in a while. Mediocre graphics are countered by a fantastic art style, fun combat, incredible music, and a story that I found myself deeply invested in.",,,,,,,,,,"To put it straight, Steelrising has won us over. Of course, the challenge might be a bit too easy for the fans of the genre, but Spiders' title opens the door to newcomers who want to try souls-like games, while remaining quite demanding. The universe is coherent and convincing, this uchronic Paris in the grip of the flames coupled to the madness of its ruler is as exciting to discover as it is dark and oppressive. Aegis and the emblematic personalities of this era participate to a pleasant scenario to follow, even if it lacks a little touch of epic and despite a convincing O.S.T.. A well-oiled adventure, close to be one of our favorite, congratulations Spiders!",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Steelrising is a solid Soulslike with well-implement and familiar design and mechanics, but its alternate history clockpunk French Revolution setting is what makes the game shine. Spiders' latest is a game that deserves your attention.",,,,"Steelrising is a decent soulslike with a great setting, but it does little else to rise above so many others like it.",,,,,,,,,,"Steelrising could and should have been Spiders' test of maturity, but unfortunately the French studio was unable to hit the target even on this round. Although the developer has come up with some appreciable and in some cases brilliant ideas, it is their realization that is not convincing in the least, as different mechanics upset the system and create an annoying imbalance between the balance of the various categories of weapons. If we add to this the usual woody animations that the Spiders action RPG have in common, the final result is an imperfect and incomplete product in several respects. On the flip side, Steelrising enjoys a whimsical and inspired narrative framework, that in the twenty hours needed to reach the end credits easily captures the attention and above all the curiosity of the player.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Steelrising's main attraction is its fascinating and gorgeous world. Paris is run down, broken and burning, and on this backdrop we get to play a a fun and violent dance with steampunk robots.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Steelrising turns out to be a perfectly correct Souls-like, but which still has some flaws specific to Spiders productions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Steelrising entices with a steampunk reimagining of the French Revolution and combat heavily inspired by Dark Souls. While it nails many aspects of its presentation and shows just how far developer Spiders has come from games like Technomancer, the combat still doesn’t flow quite as smoothly as with competitors. What it lacks in interesting environment design, it balances out with excellent atmosphere and a welcoming approach to difficulty. Thanks to an accessibility function and optional waypoints, it’s never been this easy to get into a Souls-Like. Steelrising is an excellent addition to Spiders’ portfolio and an easy recommendation for fans of Action-RPGs and those with an interest in the mysterious and enchanting world put on screen.",,,,,,,"While Steelrising has some of the trademark ‘jank’ that is in all Spider games, it is that very thing that makes this developer so special. All their games have something that just feels off (but in a good way), but all of their games I loved more than the next and true to form Steelrising is their best game to date.",,,,,,,,,,Steelrising develops a nice story and atmosphere concerning an alternate reality about the French Revolution.

assassins-creed-valhalla-dawn-of-ragnarok,,,,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarök easily eclipses both The Siege of Paris and Wrath of the Druids, serving up a good 40 hours-worth of top-notch action, exploration and challenges across a huge new world map. Combat here is enlivened by Eivor's new Hugr-Rip abilities, skills which also freshen up the game's puzzles and traversal, and the fantastical nature of the story leads to some of the biggest and best boss face-offs we've seen in the series to date. Newcomers may feel a little lost to begin with, there's a lot to get your head around here, but fans of Valhalla should be delighted with this deliciously fantastical new addition to the base game.","If you love the mythological setting, sweet new armour sets and ability to turn into a bird, then Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarök may be one of the best expansions in the series.","Dawn of Ragnarök’s purpose regarding AC: Valhalla is what its name entails; the beginning of the end for the game. The most recent expansion tends to bombard the players with a bland cast of characters, a mostly uninteresting tale and gameplay choices that tend to be mostly confusing, irrelevant and have nothing to do with the advancements we saw in the previous DLCs.",,,,,,,,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarök is an expansion that follows what the base game and the previous two expansions offered, with innovative mechanics and with a new setting, the story of Eivor/Odin keep going forward.",,,"But I'm not going to gripe about Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarök being too short – it's nice to enjoy something as generously proportioned as this without growing weary of the grind, being able to finish the story without feeling like it's being stretched far too thin. Dawn of Ragnarök is exactly as long as it should be, resolving its narrative without dragging it out, albeit with a more than adequate smattering of side stuff and secrets to unearth. As retellings of sagas from Norse mythology go, Dawn of Ragnarök accomplishes a lot within the confines of a relatively compact and highly entertaining DLC.","Dawn of Ragnarök outlines a new era for Valhalla. This DLC brings relevant and consistent novelties that really change the gameplay. Add to that an engaging epic narrative, a spellbinding new world, and a healthy dose of Norse mythology, and you have the best expansion Eivor has ever seen. Ubisoft had a nose in betting on the power of Odin and Nordic myths. However, we would have just liked a little more scope to enjoy a mythological epic worthy of Valhalla.",,,,,Dawn of Ragnarok has rich immersion and story in its epic family tale with great emotional weight.,,,,,,,,"Ubisoft promised the most ambitious DLC of the series and a 40-hour life span to go through all the content. Unfortunately, neither of these promises have been kept. Dawn of Ragnarök follows the path of the two previous expansions with an uninspired narrative that struggles to keep us interested. There is little new gameplay to acknowledge, apart from the addition of new powers, but this barely acts as a breath of fresh air. We could have been a bit more tolerant if the expansion had been included in the Season Pass, but at €39.99, there’s no way we can recommend it. Being fans of the licence, the disappointment is even greater, and we hardly recognise the series that used to fascinate us. Ubisoft must urgently make changes and go back to what made the fame of Assassin's Creed.","Thanks to its new weapons, excellent characters and nuanced narrative, Dawn Of Ragnarök comes closer than ever before to breaking free of AC Valhalla’s template. Though it can’t entirely escape some over-familiar mission types, Dawn Of Ragnarök does a great job of pulling together several strands from the main game and prior expansions. Svartalfheim and Odin’s quest give AC Valhalla renewed energy and should please both fans and maybe entice some newcomers to dip into the franchise. Dawn Of Ragnarök is a substantial and overall impressive addition to the series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dawn of Ragnarök is almost transformative for Assassin's Creed, teasing the possibility of what the series could become without the overt hand-holding that has defined it for almost two decades. However, after an intriguing opening, Dawn of Ragnarök falls back on old habits, and that feeling--coupled with how the expansion's narrative themes feel too similar to the base game--creates an experience that too often resembles something you've already had once before. But Dawn of Ragnarök is built on the bones of a great action-adventure RPG, and that carries much of the expansion, especially with the rewarding considerations introduced with the Hugr Rip. Only time will tell if Eivor and Havi's story continues beyond Dawn of Ragnarök, but if this is the end, it's a fine-enough conclusion to the relationship between the two.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dawn of Ragnarök is a generous new course for Valhalla's already enormous feast - but one which earns its place at the table.

lost-in-random,,,,"Despite these hurdles, we hold no doubt they'll be ironed out in the coming weeks. What will be left is an underrated gem that has unfortunately slipped under the radar. Coming out the same week as Tales of Arise, Life is Strange: True Colors and Sonic Colors: Ultimate, the game appears to have been lost in the noise. It's a shame, but we're confident an audience will be found of people such as us who will love and embrace this game - warts and all. Lost in Random may not strike a chord with everyone, but for those it does, they will absolutely love it.","Lost in Random is a very unique game. It has great writing and some of the best art direction of the year. However, the combat system plays a risky gamble that I don't feel quite works out in the game's favour.",,"You are not throwing the dice with Lost in Random because here the fun, the art and the originality are guaranteed.",,,,,,"Lost in Random is an original and engaging adventure, with an original combat system and a unique world that brings to life a dark fairy tale full of nuances and memorable moments. There are some flaws, but they are imperfections that minimally undermine the qualities of a game that undoubtedly deserves the attention of all fans of the genre.","Lost in Random is a unique mix between a card game and an action/adventure game. The development of the universe and the plot takes a little while to get started, but once you meet Par and his unexpected companions, you start to fall in love with his story in this strange world of Burtonian style. And we can not forget the humor that shines constantly, and the visual and sound section that does not disappoint. Its main problem is that the AI is not very challenging, and it lacks more variety in the cards.",,,,"Lost in Random enjoys an exquisite universe, between an artistic direction reminiscent of the golden age of stop motion and a particularly rich narration.

The game has a great sense of humor and the story stays entertaining throughout. It might not be Da Bomb, but it would definitely be worth a rental.",,"The Big Con presents a fun, addictive gameplay loop to embrace - despite never truly sitting right with us narratively. Its world is a delight to explore, the characters are fun and the 90s vibes wrap around you like a warm winter's blanket. It's a shame its morals are never presented in a truly challenging way, but if you can look past its messy narrative, you'll find a fun, charming indie adventure that's hard to put down.",,,"Step into the shoes of a teenage runaway and scam your way through the United States in the nineties.

But The Big Con is devoid of much real substance. Had there been more narrative, better character development and more engaging missions, this could have been something special. As it is, it feels like an underdeveloped concept that falls short of its promises.","The Big Con is a pleasant nostalgic road trip, where cassette tapes still need to be rewound, MTV still plays music videos, and America's capitalist excess is exemplified by the relative quaintness of the bustling shopping mall.","The Big Con is a blast from the past in its setting and story. While the tools to get you where you need to go need a bit of work, Ali is an exceptional main character, and playing through her story is a lot of fun. It’s short, yes, but it’s definitely worth the price of admission for an entertaining jaunt through the ‘90s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite the plethora of fanny packs, The Big Con works, and it's all down to Ali. She's a muddled teenager, concocting plans in her bedroom the same way Kenan & Kel would get up to mischief while wanting to, ultimately, do the right thing, even if it means being continually led astray on her quest. The teenage angst is mixed perfectly with grumpiness and snarkiness in equal measure, and the game is relatable to many teens (or even adults!) who've felt confused about life, have had FOMO, and want to do anything possible to make it all make sense again.

back-4-blood,,,"Back 4 Blood certainly improves upon the gameplay formula of Turtle Rock’s earlier Left 4 Dead, with a deeper feature set that allows for greater strategy and customization while fending off Hordes of the undead. But the world of the game and its characters lack the charm of its spiritual forebear, and a few curious design choices keep it just shy of greatness.","Is Back 4 Blood the Left 4 Dead 3 we've been waiting for? Yes! It's a worthy spiritual successor to Valve's classic zombie-slaying series of multiplayer games, and offers a well-designed Campaign mode with some impressive new features such as its strategic Card system. The difficulty perhaps needs balancing a little more, and the lack of meaningful progression when playing Solo Campaign needs addressing sharpish, but otherwise we've had a blast with Back 4 Blood so far, and we look forward to many more Campaign runs in the weeks, months and years to come.","It is fast, brutal, punishing and can bring complete strangers together into a zombie mincing machine. Swarm is there if you have the PvP itch, and if you can play with others, this is an easy sell.

Otherwise, jump right in.","Back 4 Blood is indeed the worthy heir of the first two Left 4 Dead games. There is no doubt about that. The title from Turtle Rock Studios offers nervous and impacting gameplay that knows how to reinvent itself as the players progress thanks to this successful deck system and these varied objectives that take place in many different places.

I’m sure there are multiple things that can be ironed out as the development team focuses on bugs, servers, and difficulty balancing, but out of the gate it’s a fun enough experience for sure, and worth checking out. Also worth noting that this is a Game Pass title, making it sort of a no-brainer if you’re on an Xbox platform.","At its best, Back 4 Blood offers a ton of variety to keep you and your friends interested for a long time. Even returning to levels you’ve already played gets interesting thanks to different cards, which can make major differences in how things play out. If you have three friends to play the whole game with, I highly recommend it.

We won't neglect its hyper fun and bloody side which will delight a good number of players who will play it in co-op and especially with friends. As for the players who want to try it alone, we advise them to pass their way because of the lack of fun linked to the catastrophic AI of the bots.",,,,"Back 4 Blood still comes out as the best Left 4 Dead-inspired game in recent memory, taking the core design and innovating on it just enough to keep everything fresh and fun. Where Back 4 Blood gets things right, it does them really well, but where it doesn’t is often quite obvious.","If you can give Back 4 Blood a chance, then eventually the game will open up as a fun and original 4-player co-op based shooter.",,"With Back 4 Blood available on Xbox Game Pass on PC and Console there’s reason to jump in if you’re looking for something new to play with friends. The look and feel is familiar and the action is engaging and chaotic when played with a group. For a while that is. Thanks to the sameness that permeates across most levels and backdrops and the predictability of the pace, it doesn’t take long for this Left 4 Dead spiritual successor to wear a little thin.",,,,,,,"Back 4 Blood isn’t a bad game. But it could have been so much better. Its difficulty needs balancing, as does the amount of enemies thrown at you at any one time. Ultimately, most levels simply have too much going on to be enjoyable – and each Act would have benefitted from being substantially shorter. Get a competent group of friends together and you might have some fun, but chances are zombie fatigue is going to set in long before you reach the end of the campaign.",,"You'll find a lot of fun in Back 4 Blood. Turtle Rock Studios managed to take something that was old and give it enough of a touch-up to make sure we recognized it but played with it differently. It's fun to hop on with your friends and blast away the zombies and compete to potentially take out the Cleaners, but you have to get past the first half of the game to get to the best parts. It doesn't help that the story gives you nothing to cling to, but once you get past those parts, the tension and excitement kick in. But sadly, playing solo hardly gives you anything like what you get playing online and with friends.",,,,"Back 4 Blood isn't perfect by any means, but it's absolutely the closest we've gotten to a new Left 4 Dead game in the years since Left 4 Dead 2. Because of this, it's hard not to have fun with B4B, even if it doesn't always feel inventive and has some notable drawbacks. Despite some qualms, if you're hungry for a new co-op shooter to jump into with some friends, Back 4 Blood has more than enough meat on the bone to keep you entertained for quite some time.",,,,,,,,,,,"We have been given a finely tooled zombie shooter, but it lacks the power of the original. This has less to do with its diminished darkness—Left 4 Dead was a far gloomier ride, lit by the panicked sway of torches—and more to do with us. And with the years. There is plenty to enjoy here, and I heartily recommend it to any who relish killing the dead. But Turtle Rock Studios wants to take us back to another time, and it’s 2 Late 4 That.","Despite a messy start, this spiritual successor to Left 4 Dead becomes more challenging and characterful the longer you spend with it.","At the time of this writing a few patches have gone out that have corrected most of the larger bugs, but there are still issues with spawning too many special infected at a time and other little issues. While these things can be frustrating, they don’t destroy the fun of Back 4 Blood when playing the game as it’s meant to be. That is playing multiplayer with a group of friends smartly navigating a nightmare filled world. Those looking to have a single player experience on the other hand may not find as much here to love, while Turtle Rock is working to fix the progression and reward issue for single players at the time of this writing there isn’t an ETA for those fixes. So, for that reason I wouldn’t recommend this for solo’s just yet, however for those folks who have been waiting for Left 4 Dead 3, or heard about how fun the original ones were and never tried them and have a team ready to face the undead… then what are you waiting for cleaner? Get out there and kill some ridden!",,Back 4 Blood has the best water-cooler moments of any game released in 2021.,,,"Back 4 Blood is a strange mix of old and new, but it works. The result is a delightfully scrappy hang-out shooter.",,"Left 4 Dead is a beautiful relic, something I and many others spent hundreds of hours playing in high school and college. But with games like Warhammer: Vermintide 2 and even Aliens: Fireteam Elite branching out and taking more of a class-based approach, I was sure Back 4 Blood’s more classic bone structure would crumble under the pressure. But Back 4 Blood is more like that makeshift, armor-clad Hummer you see in every zombie show and movie: The bones of what it once was are easy to see, but it’s been reinforced to survive in a new environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Back 4 Blood is loads of fun no matter which mode you play. The game supports cross platform (and cross gen) play for both multiplayer and co-op modes. The campaign is easily the best part of the game, but the multiplayer mode is a good companion mode. So long as you don’t mind that the game is always online and that there isn’t much of a single player mode at the moment, the game is quite good. I’m not much of a fan of online multiplayer shooters, but this type of game with loads of replay value is what I look for whenever I do play one. Like I said at the start, I don’t know how the game compares to Left 4 Dead, but that really shouldn’t matter much since Back 4 Blood is its own game, and it’s a lot of fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Back 4 Blood definitely builds on Left 4 Dead, and it doesn’t drive too far from that steady formula. But the Left 4 Dead formula still works, and it’s a recipe for quick cooperative gaming fun whenever you take it on.

Sniper Ghost Warrior: Contracts 2 takes a lot of what was fantastic of the original game and improves upon it in many ways. A graphically beautiful sandbox game that blends strategy and gameplay into an incredible tactical experience and a realistic firing mechanism that immerses you into a real-world situation. This game does have its faults and shortcomings, and yes, sadly it has a lot of them, but that didn't stop Sniper Ghost Warrior: Contracts 2 from finding the target even if it wasn't a bullseye.","Sniper Ghost Warrior: Contracts 2 is a very attractive game with exciting gameplay and a lot of interesting mechanisms. Each area is large and fun to explore, and if you enjoy stealthy commando action combined with realistic sniping then this game is a must. Even for FPS fans, there is a lot to enjoy here with plenty of gadgets and challenges to add some replay value.",,,"Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 provides one hell of a sniping experience. With so many different ways to approach your targets, multiple challenges to take on and some excellent gadgets to make use of, you’re not going to get bored easily. On the higher levels, the psychic enemies can be a bit wearisome, but this does encourage careful planning.",,Its minor AI glitches don't stop it from being the best sniper experience in years.,,,,,,,,,,,"Rather complete and benefiting from a significant visual improvement, Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 has been able to emancipate itself from its predecessor without denigrating it. While remaining faithful to the principles of the first episode, this sequel relies on immersive and spectacular ultra-long-distance spots. The developers have chosen a path that may not appeal to everyone, but in our opinion, these sequences provide additional variety. The free phases, between action and infiltration, are still present and the overall experience is very solid. CI Games is mastering its subject more and more and demonstrating it once again.",,"A modest but fun adventure set in the Middle East, with some inaccuracies due to AI that maybe would have needed some extra work. Sniper phases are well implemented, though.",,,,,,,,,,,"Our fear of a 1.5 version of Sniper: Ghost Warriors Contracts, only 18 months after the previous one was released, turned out to be quite real. Fortunately, our concern was soothed by the studio's choice for a Middle East environment with its warm colours instead of a freezing Siberia, as well as adding the well designed and essential long-range shooting feature for contracts of more than one kilometre. We can’t deny that Contracts’ formula isn’t efficient for whoever is fond of a mix of precision shots, action and stealth. This second episode enhances many strong features of the previous one, but it’s sad to say that it also keeps all the annoying parts such as a poor AI and a bland narrative to keep up appearances. Nonetheless, for whoever thinks that sniper shots are divine gifts, they will obviously have a dozen hours of intense fun with it. Thanks to an AA’s cheaper range of price, the contract is rightly fulfilled and let us hope for an exclusively new gen third episode that’ll take risks and be more ambitious than ever.",,,,,,,,"Sniper Ghost Warrior Contract 2 is so much fun to play. The action is dynamic, the levels are well crafted, and the progression system is compelling. This is a very good game, built on a strong execution of good ideas. It is separated from games like Hitman and Metal Gear Solid 5 by more modest ambition and mediocre polish but should be at the top of the list for fans of those franchises as the next best thing.",,,,,,,,,"Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 blows off a heck of a lot of heads, but never managed to blow my mind. Its long range sniper shots feel genuinely satisfying to pull off, but the enemy AI is so dimwitted it almost seems cruel to kill them.

It’s not revolutionary, and there may be better out there, but it’s a good first effort from Monkel.",,,"If you were ever put through the wringer by Inside or Limbo, and fancy climbing through again, then White Shadows will duly oblige. It’s a magnificent lightshow.",,,,"White Shadows might have a short run time and be fairly by the numbers as a platformer, but it packs a lot in for you to experience. If you enjoy your dystopian fiction then you will find a game that sets up a world which raises questions, though the the Animal Farm influence is clear to see. White Shadows hits on a lot of dark themes, but does so in such a way that is not overwhelming.",,,,"White Shadows is a cinematic platformer with a truly captivating style, which is not afraid to tackle important issues such as discrimination, slavery or suicide. The surreal and macabre world that the young protagonist crow has to face is really nice and distressing, but unfortunately the gameplay and the technical side are not always in step with the beautiful environments. Nevertheless, It's recommended to all fans of the genre, especially for the topics covered.",,,,,White Shadows contains a seductive architecture and a perfectly disturbing atmosphere which owes a lot to its sound design. But the trip is not contemplative enough to overcome the lack of energy from which the level design suffers. The game draws on inspirations already very often exploited without managing to stand out during its journey of only 2.5 hours.,White Shadows is a dark and gritty Orwell-inspired puzzle platformer. You must explore a grim industrial dystopia that will send chills down your spine. It comprises excellent ideas but it fails to evolve in the latter stages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"White Shadows is a unique title that is a strong argument for the notion of games being art. Not only does it find its individuality with its creative design, but it also has a clear message about societal issues. While some may find sections quite distressing, Monokel’s commitment to tackling sensitive topics is commendable. With this daring release being their debut title, I’m excited to see what the future holds for this talented team. Despite its short runtime, fans of narrative-focused puzzle platformers will adore this insatiable title.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With a very limited longevity, White Shadows offers an engaging aesthetic experience, but without forgetting the playful aspect. Although not predominant, the latter reaches its peaks in platform sequences with a strong scenic impact and in simple puzzle phases, but functional to the narrative. The whole is finished by an excellent sound sector, closely linked to great pieces of classical music.","White Shadows does nothing to hide his sources of inspiration: Limbo and Inside. A dark and obscure location is the right place to set a dystopian, anthropomorphic future story which can be read as a hermetic social metaphor. Though fascinating, White Shadows does too little to explain to the players where they are or what exactly it is that they’re doing, and its very simple mechanics don’t help. At the same time though, you often feel like you just can’t leave, like when watching a Lynch movie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The best way to describe White Shadows is that it feels like playing through the winner of the Best Animated Short Film at the Academy Awards. The visuals are incredible and the world is bristling with life and imagination. It's a shame that there's so little gameplay on offer, and what is there is hamstrung by poor controls and glitches. White Shadows might have been better suited as a short film, but as it stands it's a middling video game that drags down an exceptional presentation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With simple mechanics and a beautiful artistic section, but with several defects and lack of adjustments in Xbox Series.",,,,,,,,,,,"If you are well aware of the nature of the game and what it offers, it is possible to have a good time in the heart of Submerged: Hidden Depths. Thanks to its absolutely delightful universe, its peaceful rhythm and its neat soundtrack, the title of Uppercut Games does not claim to be anything other than what it is: a simple experience of exploration and of contemplation. Despite everything, drowned under a ton of dispensable collectibles and served by an optimization not always perfected, Submerged Hidden Depths certainly does better than its predecessor, but does not completely manage to embark us in its universe.","I was desperate for Submerged: Hidden Depths to jump to the next level. Sadly, though, it rigidly sticks to its guns, and that was frustrating. Yes, it’s relaxing and rewarding when you collect every seed.

So it’s a shocker to see a perfect example of what a sequel should be, making terrific use of the strengths its premise provides, allowing you to truly chill out and explore the drowned city, coming across something that feels fresh at every turn, backed up by breezy visuals and a nice soundtrack.

While I wasn’t so keen initially on one aspect of the tale, it turned around completely on a second play, but even to begin with it was nowhere near enough to ruin what is a fantastically acted and put together story, wrapped up in some of the most stunning audio visual work to date. Horror games are hardly in short supply, but very few reach this level of brilliance.",,,"Despite the slow nature of the first half of House of Ashes, when it gets into its stride it is a homage to classic science-fiction action horror titles that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The scares may not be as obtrusive as the previous titles in the anthology, but this may then appeal to those that aren’t necessarily horror fanatics.",,"House of Ashes is the third game of the anthology, a very cinematic game where we see a clear evolution in the decisions and improvements in the QTE. But the control of characters and their factions continues to fail.",,,,,,"The Dark Pictures: House of Ashes is unfortunately a step backwards compared to the previous episodes of the series, at least in terms of the script, atmosphere and technical realization. The affordable price makes it interesting for those who don't want to miss a single chapter of the anthology, but others should turn to the previous chapters or wait for a possible fourth episode capable of bringing the horror series back on the right tracks.","House of Ashes is the best game of The Dark Pictures Anthology due to its interesting history and its excellent artistic and design section, all this despite some problems that are already a constant in the saga.",,,"The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is a fun enough way to pass a few hours, and is a lot more enjoyable when you get a few friends involved. But as a cinematic story, it's far too forgettable, with writing that's never better than 'fine' with performances to match.","House of Ashes does not distort the philosophy of Supermassive Games. While retaining the cinematic staging of The Dark Pictures saga, this third episode now offers a 360 ° camera and better integrated QTEs. Thanks to its controlled rhythm, its claustrophobic atmosphere and its interesting plot, it surpasses its predecessors despite its flaws (uneven writing, cartoonish characters, frozen shooting phases…). For anyone who enjoys interactive experiences of the genre, this latest iteration of the anthology is worthy of curiosity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In all, House of Ashes feels marginally better than Little Hope, which I felt was certainly better than Man of Medan. That means The Dark Pictures entries are, by my measure, on an upward trajectory, and I sincerely hope Supermassive is able to make more of them. While I don't think this series has achieved its full potential yet, I think it's just one really great script away from achieving that. As a game, The Dark Pictures is in a great place now. As a script, this third entry in the series goes for The Descent and winds up only decent.",,,,,"There’s an immediate familiarity for House of Ashes in the Dark Pictures catalog, but this entry is as thematically complex and consequently engaging as any game in the series so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"House of Ashes is a great interactive adventure and offers a fantastic story, with a great dose of terror and claustrophobia, and also action and some of the best conflicts between characters in the entire anthology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"At the end of the day, I still enjoyed my time with House of Ashes.

nhl-22,"This years entry has brought the EA NHL series to a whole new level and it makes me excited to see what comes in future iterations. I have been playing EA's NHL series for many years, and over the years I have seen the minor and major upgrades and improvements that have come yearly. I am extremely impressed with this year's entry, making NHL 22 easier to navigate with more options for gameplay modes, all without taking away from the experience that has continued through the years. Same game with massive improvements and I love it!",,,"It's a transitional year for NHL, then. It's arguably better than ever on the ice, playing a mostly authentic and enjoyable brand of hockey that implements some subtle, but worthy new features to satisfy hardcore fans. It also looks meaningfully improved thanks to the Frostbite engine (and clearly a lot of hard work). But in terms of content and game modes, it's largely the same offering as last year, and that gets pretty old after a while. Hopefully, now that the engine transition is out of the way, we can look forward to some ambitious new modes and features in NHL 23 and beyond.","NHL 22 has started to lay down the groundwork for a great ice hockey game. It’s incorporated new mechanics in X-Factor players, graphically it’s improving and the gameplay is a mixture of fluid simulation and fast paced arcade which is a great balance. However, Be A Pro mode is still stagnant, there is a heavy reliance on spending real money on card packs in Ultimate Team and there just doesn’t feel like enough new additions to get excited by.",,,,,,,,"The richness of the game modes, the depth of the Franchise mode and the introduction of the X-Factor system are the indisputable strengths of NHL 22, but graphical uncertainties, an often de-structured commentary and the intrusiveness of microtransactions inevitably affect the final evaluation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We were eager to discover the contributions of the famous Frostbite engine for the NHL franchise. EA’s ugly duckling sports game, which always comes last, can now be at ease and benefit from a technically and graphically solid engine to face the future on the new generation of consoles. The first try isn’t perfect with disappointing face modelling, but the outstanding dynamic lighting, much more realistic physics and additional animations mean that an ice hockey game in NHL 22 has never looked so good and immersive. Unfortunately, the welcome arrival of the Superstar X-Factor can’t cover for long that the content is almost a copy and paste of the previous game. Apart from the traditional statistics update and once the wow effect of the first few games has passed, those used to the franchise will be disappointed by its monotonous content. However, NHL 22 remains an excellent sports game for other players to discover with a ton of quality game modes ranging from simulation to arcade.",,,,,,,,,,,,"In the grand scheme of things, I’d say that NHL 22 is a skip overall, though long-time hockey fans will certainly find enjoyment. And hey — just like NHL 15 before it, this is one of those years that means double Achievements/Trophies because of its cross-generation release. Quite honestly, though, I’d prefer cross-gen play and one Achievement set instead, and that’s a lot coming from Mr 600,000 Gamescore over here. It’s very likely that the matchmaking problems I’ve encountered have been exacerbated by the lack of current-gen console availability; while the Xbox One version is near identical to Xbox Series X in terms of gameplay, I’ll stick to playing the prettier-looking one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NHL 22 finally brings the series to the next-gen: the beginning is encouraging but we are still far from the magnificence that had characterized the EA series for long periods in its first thirty years of life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, NHL 22 is a solid next-gen effort for the series, and points to bigger things to come.

The large variety of them kept me looking for more species to unlock through expeditions and gene splicing. The Chaos Mode was enjoyable as a fan of the Jurassic Park movies with ‘What If’ type scenarios, but Sandbox mode left me wanting more from the game. I would say this was more geared to fans of the Jurassic Park movies as opposed to fans of park management sims, and there are much better ones out there. For fans of the movies and dinosaurs, you’d be hard pressed to find a game more in line with the franchise.",,,,"Jurassic World Evolution 2 follows on brilliantly from the original game to provide hours of utter joy.

It is an evolution of the first chapter, with new content and modes, but without adding substantial new features to the game formula.",,"Jurassic World Evolution 2 certainly has a fitting title, because it's exactly that — a true evolution. The campaign might be a little on the short side, performance problems are unfortunate, and only having a handful of the movie actors reprise their roles can feel a little jarring (the Chris Pratt soundalike is kinda terrible). But rustling beyond the foliage of these superficial issues is a simulation game with the kind of depth and nuance that the original game promised but never really delivered. There's plenty to try out across its smattering of modes, with everything you unlock during regular play feeding back into the Sandbox mode, giving you even more options to mess around with there without limits. Certainly one of the better games of its ilk, especially on console, and while it can still get a little intense by genre standards, it probably wouldn't be a very good Jurassic Park game if it didn't.",,"While Jurassic World Evolution marked a rock-solid dry run for Frontier's prehistoric theme park management sim, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a meaningful, erm, evolution, with the new Chaos Theory mode providing engaging scenarios in which you can attempt to set things right. A diverse suite of modes and slick interfaces ensures Jurassic World Evolution 2's status as an excellent sequel.","If a few additions strengthen the depth of the game a little, such as scientists or territory management, others are a little more cumbersome without being unduly disturbing. If we would have liked more clear-cut news, we once again had a great time on Jurassic World Evolution 2, for a good twenty hours.",,,,,,,"There’s genuine fun to be had with Jurassic World Evolution 2. Chaos mode and the sandbox give you a lot of options to really build the park of your dreams. When even the game’s best modes are fairly flawed, though, it becomes hard to recommend all, but the biggest Jurassic Park fans dig into this one. Players who can play on PC will almost certainly find a game that controls better, but while that’s an issue, it isn’t the only problem here. Sadly, a different control scheme isn’t going to solve Jurassic World Evolution 2’s most significant issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jurassic World Evolution 2 makes as many giant steps forward as it does back but has enough going for it to deliver a fun and rewarding theme-park experience.

Collecting every dinosaur takes time and effort, but it's worthwhile, especially since you can experiment to see what happens when every dinosaur roams freely in the same space.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you have the first game then I am seriously struggling to find persuasive reasons as to why you should spend your money on this one. I strongly believe that if all of the effort that was put into making the other modes had been put into further developing Challenge Mode, it could have been something spectacular. Instead, I’m left feeling like I played a half-finished idea that pulled heavily from the original game. If you’re new to the franchise then this is a good place to jump in, as there are a few quality of life updates to enjoy, as well as more expressive and reactive dinosaurs. If you’re a returning player however, I can’t recommend this sequel, as the minor updates don’t alter the gameplay enough for it to feel brand new.",,,,,,,,,,,,"If you loved the first Jurassic World Evolution, and have been chomping at the bit to play more new experiences, Jurassic World Evolution 2 will go down a treat.

Taking on the Busters as a Ghost offers you plenty of opportunities to be cheeky at every turn, just as you would expect from the creatures in Aykroyd's universe. While a couple of issues have stopped me from scoring this a little higher, I have no doubt that fans and newcomers alike will have a great time with this well-crafted gem.

It’s clear that Illfonic has started to eke out a nice niche for themselves with this type of game, and if you’ve enjoyed their previous efforts, you’ll likely have a lot of fun with this too. My only real complaint comes from the cosmetics, in that I’d like to see an even greater variety of clothing unlocks, and more outlandish options to boot considering the Ghostbusters comedic roots. Maybe we’ll get there through DLC, but the variations on the Ghostbuster jumpsuits and accessories feel a little plain out of the gate. Still, it’s a fun take on what a Ghostbuster video game can be, and the little nods to prior films, including the most recent one, will certainly appeal to franchise fans.",,,,,,,"Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed clearly convinced us. There are few asymmetrical games where being in one or the other team leaves us so untroubled, as they are both enjoyable to play. Everything that makes the saga a myth is present, diving us totally into the experience to the point where it becomes difficult to stop as the games follow each other with ease. The absence of paid content is a real good surprise in 2022 and the pleasure of modifying one's equipment or ghost between games pushes us to quickly return to the hunt in order to experiment with new strategies. The games are fast but intense and if we strongly advise you to assemble a solid team in order to take full advantage of it, playing alone is still quite possible thanks to the tools at our disposal. A very good point for the ghostbusters license.

If that’s not an option, matchmaking with random players is smooth and quick, and in-game markers make teamwork possible even if everyone’s playing off-mic. The thrill of Ghostbusting eventually starts to wane, but it takes a while to get to that point, and updates down the road could help to keep those Proton Packs humming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While Ilfonic who previously worked on “Predator: Hunting Grounds” and “Friday the 13th: The Game” excel at recreating the look and feel of the Ghostbusters movies, the gameplay remains relatively simple and shallow.

While it’s a bit light on the content side, the developers have a history of supporting their games long after launch with extensive updates.",,,,,,,"Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed is hands down Illfonic’s best game to date and by and large probably the most approachable asymmetrical multiplayer game on the market. Having OG Ghostbusters on board with some new blood is an awesome way to get people into the lore and making it so that player can create their own character was a super smart move as well. I’m excited to see what the team will add into the game, perhaps Dr. Venkman will show up down the line, maybe a playable mini Stay-Puft ghost; whatever it is I am excited to get more. I hope that this game sees a longer lifespan than the developers’ previous games, with all of the polish and the obvious love for the license this is one scare fest that everyone should experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The game is overall a lot of fun to play. If you’re in the mood for an asymmetrical multiplayer game that you don’t have to take too seriously, then Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed is a great choice. The game is best played as a party game with online friends or randoms. I do feel that this game might have some complications with staying relevant in the future however since there just isn’t much outside of the one mode of play and there isn’t enough extra content to unlock once you reach a certain level. In the short run however, this game is quite good. Be sure to give the game a try if you’re a Ghostbusters fan. I’m sure fans of the series will feel right at home the most!",,"Easy to learn, intuitive to play, with hours upon hours of new toys to play with, Spirits Unleashed is a real labor of love. For a franchise that’s long struggled with a consistent margin for quality, Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed goes above and beyond to answer the call. Now if someone can just convince them to incorporate some ghosts and levels from the IDW comics, then it’ll be darn-near perfect.",,,,,,,,I’m amazed that it took 37 years to release an online multiplayer Ghostbusters experience where you can be your own Ghostbuster or play as a menacing specter against your friends.

It still needs some bug fixes for things liked a dropped-out soundtrack, and while it lacks much to keep you coming back, it's the perfect game to hop into between much longer games in your library.",,,,,,,,,,"Overall, Tanuki Sunset is a wonderful game, especially for those looking for a simple, stylish game to play at the end of a long day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The endless runner genre has seen a lot of potential contenders try and be the best, and while Tanuki Sunset isn’t quite the best of the best, it’s enjoyable enough to leave a positive impression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
outriders,"I have no doubt that Outriders will improve over time but I’m kind of torn about how I feel for it in its current state given its issues. On one hand I’m addicted to the shlooter treadmill, but on the other, having already reached endgame and grind the hell out of it, I think I see my end in sight without much further to do aside from yet another run for hopefully a new piece of gear. That said, Outriders is currently included with Xbox GamePass, so there’s no reason to not jump into the shoes of an Altered to save Enoch, even if it does turn into quite a grind later on and having to suffer through numerous game crashes daily.",,"People Can Fly’s special brand of explosive gunplay is better than ever in Outriders, but the game loses its way by shoehorning in too many of the RPG mechanics that have become bog standard for the “looter shooter” genre. What should have been a rollercoaster all the way through ends up feeling more like a car in stop-and-go traffic.","Outriders really has taken us completely by surprise. This is a game that gets off to a pretty bad start but, once the combat kicks off properly, quickly reveals itself to be one of the slickest and most addictive looter shooters we've played in a long while. Launch weekend has been a mess of server issues, for sure, but stick with what People Can Fly has dished up here and you'll find yourself handsomely rewarded. This one comes highly recommended.","Outriders on Xbox is a great game, almost despite itself. The decision to include cooperative opportunities instead of working with a nailed on PvP mode is a great choice. The story is engaging, gameplay works very well and the Expeditions are just about challenging enough. In fact, People Can Fly have ensured that shooting, looting and running away from powerful monsters has never been so much fun.","Outriders is a quite pleasant surprise when it comes to its combat mechanics, lore, structure and overall quality. It is a bright example that a looter-shooter can be fun, addictive and extremely enjoyable without the need to reside on a ""Games as a Service"" mentality.","Outriders is the studio's most ambitious work, a shooter looter that knows how to get the best out of each of its elements, with aggressive gameplay and a good RPG layer.",,,"If you're willing to overlook some questionable design choices, there's plenty of fun to be had with Outriders. Despite its numerous flaws, Outriders manages to provide loads of incredible, over-the-top fun.",,,"Outriders is a very well thought-out shooter, with a gameplay capable of satisfying both solo and in co-op, and good looting and progression mechanics. Too bad for the many connection problems that plagued it so far, making it pretty much impossible to play with friends. Once these problems have been addressed, just consider this review score increased by 1.","Outriders is a game that has surprised me. The demo failed to get me excited. But with the complete game I have come across things that I liked a lot, such as its lore, and its rawness, although also others have discouraged, such as its maps with unnatural coverage. It is a game that takes time to gain pace, but it works well in all its aspects, without standing out too much in any of them. Perhaps the best thing about the game is its cooperative component, which enhances the experience.","An incredible get for Game Pass and a superb game in its own right (issues aside), Outriders is comfortably one of the best games of the year so far, and it's only going to get better as the post-launch polish puts paid to the technical problems that currently hold it back from true greatness.",,"Outriders is a looter-shooter built upon solid enough foundations, and its blend of gunplay and powers can prove intermittently enjoyable. But it's also a game lacking an engaging narrative heart, characters that you'll care about, and any sort of exciting long-term content. The quest for loot will only sustain you for so long.","Outriders does not revolutionize the genre, and does not have the ambition to do so. The title from People Can Fly and Square Enix recites the ranges of the perfect Looter-Shooter while abandoning the Game as a Service dimension inherent in this type of game. It stands out first and foremost with its science-fiction-inspired universe, fantasy and punk movement. The explosiveness of its combat, its extremely well thought-out customization system and this propensity to motivate players with ubiquitous power gain make this Shooter-RPG an outsider to consider. However, the anecdotal scenario, the sketchy staging, the redundancy of the missions and the instability of the game do not allow Outriders to fully assert itself on the Looter-Shooter scene.",,,,,,"Still, despite its issues, I mostly enjoyed my time with Outriders, and with a few more updates and tweaks I think it’ll be at a point where I’d like to go back and play more of the end-game content or roll another character class. I’d say it’s a harder sell at full price for $60 right now, but it’s more of a no-brainer to try out if you have the option to do so on Xbox platforms via Gamepass.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The game shows great potential, but in its current state, the game feels a little half-baked. It needs more types of enemies, some better story missions and a much better net-code, in order for me to enjoy the game at its fullest.",,,,"Outriders actively props up its own strengths and encourages you to employ them, organically allowing you to experience its full potential and mostly outweighing a disjointed story.",,,,,,,,,,,"Outriders semi-bravely attempts to be more than just another third-person shooter, but fails to be more interesting than the many other games it resembles. Borderlands 3 for example is a better looter shooter, Destiny 2 offers a more solid (super)powered trip, Deep Rock Galactic is more fun as a co-op experience and Gears 5’s singleplayer campaign is far more fascinating. This means Outriders is hard to recommend, except of course to those who have Game Pass and a some hours of free time to spare.",,,,,,,,"Outriders combines immense variety, aggressively geared combat and fun abilities to offer a third person shooter like no other. It’s filled to the brim quality content – bringing a stellar campaign that’s constantly throwing new things at the player and a compelling well-designed post-game experience in Expeditions. Teething issues with online aside, Outriders is poised to be one of the biggest surprises of the year, and you should definitely give it a go.",,,"Despite its constant flaws and lack of originality, Outriders is a very fun game that manages to bring together the best elements of various contemporary titles.",,"Outriders isn't a paradigm shift for third person shooters, but it offers an absolutely irresistible loop of action, looting and micromanagement and, although its presentation isn't at the level of other modern titles, it will always leave us wanting to continue playing.",,,,,,,,,"With Outriders, People Can Fly managed to craft an extremely fun game, with mechanics that subvert the idea of a cover shooter, while maintaining a loot system that is delightfully mesmerizing. The frantic and aggressive combat system is so addictive that it helps to cover up the game’s weaknesses, such as the history or repeatability, since we are too busy dispatching endless hordes of enemies.",,,"The only reason you should pay attention to Outriders is the current gaming drought and the Game Pass. The combat with all its abilities is quite fun, sure, but the story is just so dull, as is the environment and uninteresting, generic activities.",,,,,,"All in all, Outriders falls short of Anthem in the launch-period stability stakes. Having to combat the game to be able to combat enemies and then combat the game to be able to combat enemies and then combat the… well, it’s just not worth it.",,"Outriders gather true and tried gameplay functionalities from many games in the same genre. There’s no originality to be found here, but it will reward everyone who takes the time to discover its generous content and challenges.",,,,"It cracks into the crowded looter-shooter genre and carves out a niche, all while telling an entertaining story. Its character-building is top-notch, its PvE gameplay is challenging and rewarding, and despite not being a live-service game it comes complete with end-game content that is more robust than most games that are trying to be live-service.",,"The moments where Outriders is taking daring swings at mixing disparate elements are when it's at its best. The game is surprisingly deft at combining things that shouldn't work together: Its story is often funny but similarly severe; its combat requires you to take cover and to charge; its abilities make you phenomenally powerful but prone to overestimating yourself. If you can find the balance in Outriders, People Can Fly's RPG-shooter finds ways to combine well-worn video game ideas into something new and fun. Especially when you're accompanied by friends and put the time in to really understand the game's systems, Outriders rewards you with epic battle moments and a sprawling scope. It left me wanting to continue venturing out into the wilds of Enoch to see what I might find there--and to smash whatever it was with seismic earthquake magic.",,,,,"If you’re absolutely craving a new game that has tight gunplay and a loot loop that you can get into for a long period of time, Outriders definitely isn’t your worst option. But if you have played a litany of games like this over the past few years, I’m hard-pressed to think that there is anything about this one that will resonate with you on a greater level.",,,"Outriders might not be the best game this year will bring, it is so much fun. This game is definitely a blast with its many weapons and skills. Too bad there are so many connectivity issues.",,"Although it features moments of satisfying action and a few good end-game design tweaks, the majority of Outriders experience consists of conflicting design ideas, technical issues in multiplayer, and poorly implemented borrowed mechanics.",With its high dynamic fighting system and various combat combos Outriders creates a unique and stylish look and feel within the 3rd person action genre. Above that the game provides an entertaining and extensive loot shooter experience for solo players and co-op fans as well. But the weak story and some minor balance issues prevent Outriders from an absolute recommendation.,,"It is a game that is interested in one thing and one thing only: turning enemies into bloody smears and hopefully finding some new shoes. And, thankfully, it is very good at it. If you are one of those people-who-like-this-kind-of thing, of course.",,,"The best time I had with the game was a ten-minute stretch that contained (a) no crashes or bugs, (b) the right level and world tier—essentially, a measure of enemy toughness—and (c) a harmony of tactics, sorcery, and gunfire.",,"Visually the game looks good. We have not gotten a lot of titles to showcase these new consoles and Outriders does a good job with a rock-solid 60fps on Series X. The worlds are diverse, and the giant monsters are a sight to behold. The voice acting is atrocious and the story forgettable, but the actual world and shooting are simply outstanding. Outriders is a perfect storm. A shiny new game to show off these new consoles. The fact that it launched day and date onto Game Pass has definitely helped with its success, as has the fact that gamers are hungry for new experiences. I will likely be playing a bunch of Outriders in 2021, and that speaks volumes to its longevity. I hope the team continues to expand on the title as we move through the year, as I look forward to coming back to it for quite some time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In spite of the weak story and awful launch state, Outriders still manages to be a compelling and rewarding looter shooter.",,,"Outriders has surpassed my expectations in almost every way. Months ago, I figured this would be another looter flop, but now, it’s one of the best current entries in the genre, and even with no “live service roadmap” at hand, it’s clear you could potentially extract hundreds of hours from it regardless. I plan to do just that.",,,,,,,,,,"Outriders is old school action that stands tall as a satisfying and vulgar display of power that’s fast, frantic, and pure fun.",,,"It all adds up to a solid sci-fi battling sandbox, although at the moment, the game is marred by bugs. Outriders is prone to crashes, and load times can be long. And the cross-play and cross-save features that were expected are messy and confusing (although both ideas are new for this console generation, so you give Outriders a slight flier). Such issues hold the game back, limiting the overall fun and immersion you can experience in the world of Outriders. Still, when you combine characteristics from some of the greatest franchises in gaming, you’re bound to get a pretty solid game. And that’s exactly what Outriders is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Outriders fails in many areas as its story is useless, lines are delivered terribly and cutscenes are awful. Despite this, PeopleCanFly has created an amazingly fun gameplay loop that will entice any loot junky out there. It may feel like a 15-year-old game at some points but once you get into the combat all of these woes will be forgotten.",,"At times, the game is nearly unplayable, and more than once, I’ve either crashed or watched a teammate crash at the final Drop Pod, or during a story cinematic. Still, Outriders manages to entertain far more than it frustrates. If you were like me, scoffing at the demo, thinking that there was nothing more in this shallow looter-shooter, it’s time to think again. If you’re looking for a challenge, and you don’t mind the interstellar flight to Enoch to find it, Outriders is the game for you.",,,,,,,,
assassins-creed-valhalla-wrath-of-the-druids,,,,,"I'm a massive fan of Assassin’s Creed and have found myself loving the latest games more than any which went before them. That is equally true of Valhalla yet, whilst the Wrath of the Druids is a strong addition to the library, it does at times feel more like a side quest rather than something capable of pushing forward the overall Valhalla narrative.","Wrath of the Druids brings new gameplay features that work exceptionally well, while Ireland, its culture and ancient roots are brought forward in a way that amazes and satisfies the player. Still, this new chapter suffers from mistakes that have been surprisingly imposed upon the series, with an unnecessary display of mythological and fantasy features that shouldn’t have been there in the first place. Additionally, like the core game, the new chapter is struggling with bugs that need to be dealt in order to ensure an optimal gaming experience.",,,,"For being Valhalla's first big expansion, Wrath of the Druids plays it a little too safe but still delivers an exciting adventure in the end.",,,,,,,,"Wrath of the Druids is an interesting DLC because of its generosity but which is sorely lacking in originality and new elements compared to Valhalla. Offering 10 to 15 hours of scripted adventure, it extends the experience, serving us Ireland on a set. However, we would have appreciated a more in-depth treatment of the druids, relegated to the rank of obscure threat like “Order of the Ancients” and a much better balanced difficulty, just to do honor to the various quests, both main and secondary.",,Quotation forthcoming.,,,"Wrath of the Druids is an excellent DLC. It does everything right in setting the new locale apart from its neighbor to the east while delivering a strong new plot and set of characters. Not every new mechanic feels fully realized, but for what they do offer, I enjoyed them and particularly enjoyed the way they played into the greater mythos and context of the game as a whole. If the remainder of Assassin’s Creed Valhall‘s major DLC—and future Assassin’s Creed stories, for that matter—follow suit, I’ll be very glad for it.","Overall, I enjoyed revisiting Assassin’s Creed Valhalla for this expansion, and consider it to be a fine add-on to the game. Whether you’re in the middle of a current playthrough or would be coming back to the game after completion, you’ll find you can jump into Wrath of the Druids at pretty much any point, which is a good way to handle an expansion in an open world game like this one. Admittedly I’m not particularly wowed by any one element here, but if you’ve already enjoyed Valhalla up to this point, I can’t really see a reason to not pick up the expansion as well. You’re definitely getting a sizable amount of engaging content for the asking price, and some of the new mechanics and gear available makes for a pretty entertaining time overall.",,,,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla expands its possibilities with this DLC called Wrath of the Druids, which takes us to a new region and adds an interesting story arc full of new missions and charismatic characters. No surprises, but don't need it either.",,,,"Wrath of the Druids is a substantial, mechanically strong and visually impressive expansion for Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and anyone who appreciated the main game will absolutely enjoy Eivor’s journey to the Emerald Isle. Wrath of the Druids does not make any fundamental changes to Valhalla’s game play but it’s easy to become invested in the new story, interesting characters and beautiful environments, and can be enjoyed by a player at any level.",,,,,,,,"Wrath of the Druids delivers a good reason to get back to Assassin's Creed Valhalla. It's story is much more focused than what we got in the base game, its activities offer plenty of satisfying loot and the new types of enemies are a breath of fresh air (or hallucinogenic fog). This is an expansion that does everything better, and while we're, once again, doing whatever some king wants us to do, i had fun with it.ֲ","Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Wrath of the Druids is an incredible DLC and brings an enormous amount of new items, abilities, cosmetic items, and locations for players to discover. Ireland makes for the perfect location to expand the Valhalla experience, keeping true to the region’s history, culture and beliefs. I’m especially fond of how much replay value has been encapsulated into Northern Ireland thanks to an endless supply of challenging side quests. In addition to the new raid locations, “Wrath of the Druids” takes the nice elements of the main game such as stealth and poison and brings out their full potential in amazing ways. Wrath of the Druids has pushed the bar even higher for the Assassin’s Creed series and I can’t recommend it enough to anyone who has Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"It repeats the typical mistake of other DLCs from the franchise (repeating the mechanics of the main game with a coat of paint), but its simple, focused story is well developed.",,,,,,,,,"Wrath of the Druids is a great addition to Valhalla’s already well-bolstered package. Visiting Ireland, learning about its rich history and mythology is something I’d never thought that I would be interested in. But Wrath of the Druids is so engaging that it’s hard not to recommend to people who enjoyed Valhalla. Just don’t expect it to reinvent the wheel, but instead, bring a few more.",,,Wrath of the Druids is a DLC that is responsible for delivering an entertaining story with a couple of changes to the formula seen in Assassin's Creed: Valhalla.,,,,,,,"The first big Valhalla DLC exchanges the gigantic England for a more compact Ireland, but the new story aside it mostly delivers more of the same.",,,,,,,,,,"Overall, Wrath of the Druids is not a bad addition to Assassin's Creed Valhalla. It's even a good one for those who want any reason to step in Eivor's shoes again. But for those who have turned their attention elsewhere, it doesn't do much to bring them back.",,"If you are still enjoying Valhalla then Wrath of the Druids is worth a gander. Hopefully the Siege of Paris expansion breaks the mold a little, but for now this first expansion acts as a serviceable excuse to revisit Assassin's Creed Valhalla, if nothing more than to tour about 9th century Ireland.","What you’re left with is a stunning new place to explore, an excellent story and expansive deep-dive into Celtic mythology and some new systems. But this is mostly driven by familiarity and a lack of anything truly dynamic or emergent. If you loved the formula of Valhalla, this is a bit of a no-brainer, but if you were hoping for something completely different or new, you’ll largely only find that in this fae tale.",,,,,,"I’m sure hardcore Valhalla fans hungry for a new adventure won’t necessarily be upset to hear that Wrath of the Druids delivers more of the same. Certainly, if you loved the main game you’ll appreciate more content to sink your teeth into. For everyone else, play the free seasonal events until there’s a discount.",,"If Valhalla is a love letter to the Assassin's Creed series, connecting each of the previous 11 mainline games and unifying their frayed plotlines into one cohesive thread, Wrath of the Druids is an unneeded and, frankly, unwanted postscript. It adds nothing worthwhile to Eivor's story and her overarching character arc of learning that there's more to life than subverting fate. And in terms of mechanics and features, it doesn't satisfyingly iterate on any of Valhalla's existing gameplay loops, providing another dozen hours of the same activities you'll already get from the existing 60+ hour main campaign. Those still playing Valhalla may find some benefit in going through Wrath of the Druids for some extra XP to boost Eivor's character level and find some awesome loot and combat abilities, but the DLC is a mediocre Assassin's Creed experience, even without comparing it to Valhalla's main campaign.",,,,,,,,,"Wrath of the Druids is simply more Assassin's Creed Valhalla, with a few added twists and some of the same baggage.

grid-legends,"It’s an above-average experience, and one that is worth checking out if you’re a fan of arcade racers. The driving is fast, frenetic and fun, and there’s quite a bit of content to be found within. It also attempts to build on every aspect of the 2019 reboot, though I admittedly got into and enjoyed that game more.",,,"Overall, GRID Legends feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. Its on-track racing is really good fun, and with the right AI and event tweaks, and a little more content, it'd be a really solid sequel to GRID 2019. As it stands, it feels very safe and lacks the personality to really stand on its own amongst the competition. It gets real close to mimicking what PGR did so well all those years ago, but something's missing. Sparks often fly out on the track, but Legends doesn't quite have the spark to make its arcade action stick.","Aside from the odd problem and a lack of really new tracks, GRID Legends proves that once again Codemasters know exactly how to make a racer.",,GRID Legends places its bets in growing upon the bases that made it a racing icon. It's not perfect but adds enough innovation and content to enjoy it for quite a long time.,,,,,"GRID Legends is a racing game that provides some cool elements to the formula but doesn’t do enough to stand out in a saturated market. The amazing graphics and solid controls are a plus, but if players aren’t racing game fans, they could skip this one, especially with the large price tag.","GRID Legends lives of ups and downs: it makes decisive steps forward compared to the previous episode, with a good technical realization and a frantic and fun driving model, but it fails to differentiate itself enough when switching cars, flattening the gaming experience. It's suitable mainly for those who are looking for entertainment without too many frills, but less recommended for those seeking something deeper and more refined.","GRID Legends repeats with an exciting arcade driving game. For those who played the last game of this franchise, they will find a similar game. Codemaster recover this racing game focuses on the basics, and that is barebones racing. With some new challenges, the most relevant could be the narrative experience that they included in the same way that they include in F1 2021.","Grid Legends is one of the cheesiest games I've ever played, thanks to its Drive to Glory story mode. Putting that to one side, there is a good racing game here with an excellent AI system (that can go a bit awry), some beautiful and well-designed tracks, and cars that feel great to drive. However, Grid Legends is dragged down a bit by the easily-forgettable story mode, and the game is just far too easy even on the highest difficulty. Still, there is a competent racer here that offers plenty of thrilling moments and enough cars and modes to keep fans of the genre happy.",,"While DIRT 5 and F1 2021 remain Codemasters' best racing games to date, GRID Legends runs a very close second, with an enjoyably daft Story mode, absorbing Career, and a wealth of options to fiddle with. Driven to Glory, indeed.","Much like the previous title released in 2019, GRID Legends will not revolutionize the history of racing games, but it is still very good arcade entertainment. If it does not go far enough in the depth of its career mode and in the possibilities of customizing the liveries, the title is on the other hand very complete on its most raw aspect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"If Grid Legends takes a good step forward compared to Grid 2019, this step is unfortunately not a leap. Content-wise, Codemasters was generous with more cars, more tracks, a kind of disappointing story mode which serves as an interesting tutorial and finally an efficient, yet classic and extensive career mode that can be done in multiplayer. Unfortunately, the limited physics of the racetrack and a poorly managed AI are quite anticlimactic. Nevertheless, the signature arcade atmosphere typical of Grid’s fierce races with no holds barred remains true to itself if you are lucky enough to have a driving level that fits the game’s difficulty scale. Grid Legends is therefore mainly aimed for a casual audience searching for a fun and very accessible racing game. If you are a seasoned car racing fan, the game’s blatant flaws will quickly be the only things you notice.",,,,,"A return to arcade, a return to the docks, a return to drifting, and a return to putting fun above all else. This is what Grid should be about, enough fun to be had with the story and career modes, but an absolute hoon with a couple of mates in multiplayer.",,,"Grid Legends is certainly not a bad racing game and has a lot of redeeming qualities, yet it doesn’t quite live up to the high quality usually associated with Codemasters. Games like Forza Horizon 5 are more fun to play while the likes of F1 2021 and Dirt offer more realistic and challenging gameplay. The introduction of the unpredictable AI is a welcome step in the right direction, as are the improvements made compared to its predecessor. However, Grid Legends can’t shake a poor story mode that bogs down the action and will disappoint those expecting a cohesive and exciting narrative.",,,,,,,,,Grid Legends is a sure step up from Grid 2019 – and its new story mode that looks all the way back to 2002’s TOCA Race Driver is a cute and effective flex for a racing series with such history – but it's definitely treading water in some core areas.,,"Grid Legends doesn't do anything particularly wrong, but doesn't do anything particularly interesting either. Its racing gameplay is typically solid, as is the Codemasters way, but this studio has pushed the limits of the genre far higher in the past than it does with this relatively safe offering.",,,,,,,,"Codemasters racing thrives on lights and shadows. To attract the greatest number of players, GRID Legends seems to have partly lost the common thread that had characterized the very good reboot in 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"And if it's racing with a story that you're after, The Crew and Need for Speed franchisers have you well covered with their mix of outlandish, goofy storytelling and arcade style racing. Perhaps if Legends cut the story entirely, pared down the overly long career mode, and simply focused on being a multidisciplinary arcade racing game, it might find that niche it once occupied on the shelf, back when it was simply known as TOCA.",,,,"GRID Legends is a big step in the right direction for Codemasters, offering enjoyable and easy to access online racing. However, it is let down by a few technical hiccups on the Xbox Series S, and fails to shout loud enough in a genre that’s about to become even more crowded.",,,,,,,,,,,"GRID Legends opted this time to innovate with a story mode that feels somewhat unnecessary. However, it is important to mention that the game did not neglect any of the other aspects that make up a very attractive package for any fan of the genre and a great entry point for the curious and younger drivers.",,,,"GRID Legends tries to speed ahead of the pack by including a story mode around a failing racing team portrayed by live-action actors. Despite superficial novelty, the game fails to really connect the events of the story to actual gameplay and leaves the player character out almost completely. Thanks to excellent and nuanced driving mechanics and an impressive amount of courses and vehicles, this can still be worth checking out for die-hard racing fans, even if it cannot quite live up to the best the genre has to offer.",,,,"Grid Legends' Driven to Glory story misses more than it hits, but this is an otherwise solid, if unambitious, racing game.",,,"Grid Legends is a great game that was simply released at the wrong time. PlayStation owners are more likely to jump on Gran Turismo 7, and Xbox owners are most likely still satisfied with Forza Horizon 5. It is hard to slide between these two franchises and achieve much success. Still there is a trial on EA Play so give it a shot. I had a great time with it, but quickly forgot about it after a week. I do wish the game felt more like a successor as opposed to an upgrade to Grid 2019.",,,,,,,"My complaints aren’t much more than minor dents and scratches on another beautiful ride from video gaming’s foremost racing studio. Grid Legends’ developers put a ton of effort into Driven to Glory, and then wisely made that a preamble to a much larger, much longer playing experience elsewhere, rather than focusing players’ attention entirely on a single-use story mode. It’s a strong, tarmac-based counterpart to the Dirt series, and satisfies a wider range of competitive urges than the dedicated F1 simulation that launches every year. And the consistently exciting racing, as both spectator and competitor, that Grid Legends delivers should have every racing fan wondering why something like this can’t be found in real life, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"All too often racing games follow the standard formula. Throw some fast cars and a bunch of tracks together, and gamers will probably enjoy themselves in silence. But when developers step off the beaten path, something magical can happen. This is the case with GRID Legends. Despite its shortcomings – the low difficulty, to name just one thing - it is one of the more enjoyable racing games of the moment.",,,,,,,,,,"Grid Legends fall short and leave us with a feeling that the franchise is still lost, searching for a path or identity. It has little to offer in the face of similar games that achieve greatness. Ultimately, it's a race with nothing glorious, nor legendary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mount-blade-ii-bannerlord,"Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord feels excellent in most cases, like whacking someone off their horse with a spear, or getting that perfect hit on an enemy in battles. The map is far more varied from the first game and they improved on a lot of mechanics in this sequel as well. Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord was shallow in some ways, and sometimes has annoyingly hidden game mechanics, but kept me coming back for how unique it felt from its freedom of choice.",,,,"For many, it will be the ambition of taking a character from nothing before throwing them into a huge adventure, one full of heart and soul, which will be the key to Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord is a wonderfully in-depth adventure RPG. You'll love its sprawling open world, and its time-sink campaign. Sadly, its multiplayer option isn't as captivating, but that matters not. With vast battles and folksy audio, this will impress you throughout.",,"Bannerlord, in spite of its shortcomings, is a great game to play for tactics enthusiasts and players that love huge battles. Its simulation style of gameplay is fairly unique and keeps me coming back. An easy recommendation to all that love their sandboxes.",,,,,,"Bannerlord doesn't excel graphically or in storyline, but makes that up in flexibility and scale. The vibrant world evolves even without the gamer and offers both opportunities and threads that can be exploited. This is a true medieval sandbox where the player can act as he wishes, but always has to face the consequences. While much great effort is put into making this game playable on consoles, the sheer number of options, menus and controls make this better suited for PC.",,,,"Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord is the long-awaited sequel fans have been waiting for and it offers a much better gameplay experience than its predecessor thanks to a myriad of adjustments. Still as addictive as ever, the concept is once again foolproof and gives us even more freedom of choice in the adventure and the kingdom we build. Graphically speaking, it is much more up to date than Warband and this new opus will undoubtedly seduce previous fans and win over new players.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bannerlord is a layered experience, even played on console, despite some flaws with its controls.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Should you buy Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord? If you’ve got the slightest taste for big battles or an interest in medieval conquest, absolutely. Don’t expect the depth of, say, Crusader Kings III, but for fans of medieval warfare this is a real winner.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mount & Blade 2 is an unpolished diamond. Many of its systems need to be fleshed out, even after leaving Early Access and especially the campaign is a letdown when compared to the almost identical sandbox mode. Yet despite technical shortcomings, this game offers a realistic roleplaying experience in a grounded medieval setting that no other game can rival. Especially larger scale battles and sieges are incredible and almost justify the price of admission on their own.",,,,,,,"Like Total War, when the players massive armies clash in battle it is a sight to behold, luckily the game offers the option to simulate battles and watch the AI troops clash. This, to me was massively more enjoyable than trying to struggle through the games clunky combat. While I loved the depth offered in the RPG elements of the world, I came away disappointed enough by the combat that is just made the whole experience feel like a chore to play; combine that with the lack of a real story and I Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord just didn’t turn out to be the total medieval simulator game I was hoping for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
atomic-heart,,"Disjointed is the lingering feeling once all is set and done with Atomic Heart. The articulate opening and the immense effort made to craft an absorbing alternate-history World War II Russia is certainly appreciable and admirable. Dishearteningly though, the FPS experience is weighed down by an awful lot of busywork and obnoxiously annoying characters that it’s hard to feel wholly immersed. As an FPS it certainly has some aplomb going for it, but it gets lost in the shades of comparison with greater games. If Atomic Heart was able to carry the brilliance of its opening twenty minutes it would be an excellent game, but sadly we’re stuck with an entertaining enough but bland and by the numbers shooter.",,"So, yeah, where do we even start with summing this one up? To be honest, a recommendation depends on your own interest with the world of Atomic Heart, we must admit. The game's premise remains intriguing throughout, and its main missions provide some great combat scenarios to get stuck into, especially when it comes to using powers and the skill tree system to create different characters builds. Yet, the game's overworld is largely skippable which is a huge bummer, and its main storyline does little to enhance the incredibly interesting world Mundfish has created. Atomic Heart is well worth a play for the immersive FPS fanatics out there, but it's wise to temper your expectations when names like BioShock and DOOM are being thrown around in comparison. Atomic Heart is a solid alternate-history shooter, but it takes a bit more than building an intriguing world to become a true great in the genre.",,,Atomic Heart has everything that shooters have taught us in recent years and its mix with Soviet flavor gives it the point of originality to be the fresh product we were looking for.,,,"Atomic Heart nails the art design and core gameplay loops but loses focus due to its vast array of game mechanics and untailored open-world segments. Inconsistent writing quality and inaccessible game design will likely frustrate many players, but Atomic Heart can still manage to be an incredibly fun adventure.",,"Atomic Heart promises tens of hours of tense, first-person, Bioshock-style combat, a compelling, twist-filled narrative, challenging puzzles and an eccentric lead duo that will definitely grow on you.","Atomic Heart is a surprising and often impressive game, with brilliant technical/artistic values and a varied gameplay capable of mixing many different elements. It manages to stay intriguing and interesting for all it remarkable length, even if it suffers of balancing issues and of a lacklustre and forgettable open world. If you love narrative FPS experiences, this is one not to miss.","Atomic Heart is a musical and action delight. It combines elements from BioShock, Fallout or Doom and creates something unique, something that is worth it to play on its own. The Mundfish first game is a meritorious one and mark the beginning of something even greater.","There's a lot going on in Atomic Heart, so it's perhaps unsurprising that consistency and cohesion aren't the game's strong suits. It does, however, excel in spectacle, presenting a fascinating world and packing it with an assortment of incredible mechanical creations.",,"Controversy aside, Atomic Heart is a robust first-person affair, albeit one that revels in glorified Soviet iconography and Wolfenstein-esque alternate history weirdness. The difference is, there's no ambiguity in shooting Nazis – here, however, you can’t help but have a sense of unease while playing.","Frankly stunningly beautiful, Atomic Heart opens with stunning architecture and a catchy pitch before unfolding a story that struggles a little to convince and lets out dozens of dialogues that can make you wince. Remains a rather decent gameplay divided between classic and robust combat, hyper clever puzzles and barely decent platforming.",,,"Atomic Heart is an excellent game, and it’s an incredible debut title from Mundfish. Clever storytelling, massive set pieces, fun combat, and more make this one easy to recommend.",,"With the environmental glitches, an odd narrative, and too much imitation of two iconic games, Atomic Heart lands in the middle for me. Not bad, not great, just fine.",,,,,,,,"Ultimately, our opinion about Atomic Heart leaves a sour taste in our mouths. At first, we were very excited by this memorable introduction and a cool building to explore, but we were quite disappointed by the bland and trite open world environment. After enjoying the discovery phase, the fun of it all quickly fades away. The initial ideas concerning the various gameplay phases were not bad, but they should not have been recycled ad nauseam. Right now, Mundfish's title has all the makings of a repetitive game ticking all the industry’s requisites without mastering the ins and outs of the genre. This results in a pleasant title that should nonetheless find its audience. Sadly, it will also disappoint a lot of people. Was it too ambitious? Perhaps. It must be said that, according to us, the studio masters quite well the technical side: it still needs more work to be convincing, though. So, a sour taste, but one that still needs to be experienced nonetheless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atomic Heart is a deeply ambitious, highly imaginative, and consistently impressive atompunk-inspired attempt at picking up where the likes of BioShock left off – something it’s done with a lot of success. It certainly makes missteps, chiefly with an irritating leading man and a self-indulgent habit of using the same tired tropes it tries to make fun of, but this stern, superpowered, and stringently solo shooter has worked its way under my skin despite these flaws. Atomic Heart didn’t always blow me away, but it definitely has the ticker to punch well above its weight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The story plays out like a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced popcorn atrocity, the upgrade shop might as well be Travelex given how many currencies it juggles, and the performance is less than optimal. Atomic Heart is an exercise in excess. It has some clear strengths, like its first in class art direction and gunplay, however these are far outweighed by the game’s faults.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mundfish arrives with a charismatic and powerful proposal that leaves us wanting a sequel.,,,,,"Atomic Heart's story, gameplay, and world design have promise, but the payoff is lacking across the board.",,,,,,,,,,,"There are quite a few parts of Atomic Heart that just don't neatly fit together, and those disparities create an experience that often feels at odds with itself. That disparity is most evident in how the history of the world in Atomic Heart is interesting and sets up an intriguing conversation about the nature of free will and collectivism, but then the unlikable protagonist repeatedly prevents that topic from being explored. Atomic Heart is certainly going to appeal to some people, especially those looking to relive BioShock Infinite, but it's not an easy recommendation.",,,,,,"Solid shooter with an unused setting, which doesn't stand out from the crowd due to a lame overworld and some unround mechanics.",,,,,"Atomic Heart immediately draws you in with its enchantingly weird story of a retro-futuristic Soviet Union. However, an interesting and visually compelling vision is hampered by a meandering story and some truly awful combat encounters. What comes to mind is style over substance, yet there’s plenty of content to be found here, just none of it standing out as particularly well-polished. Still, the game has a fair share of interesting ideas and moments that make it worth experiencing despite its flaws.",,,"Atomic Heart packs satisfying combat and a unique alt-history setting, but its open world feels half-baked.",,,,"Atomic Heart is a game I was excited to finally play, but went in with low expectations considering how long it was in the oven. The end result is easily one of the best games I have played this year and an experience I recommend everyone dig into. It won’t be for everyone, but for those that it is for it will be an amazing experience. There is just so much to this world and I had a blast exploring the world of Facility 3826. I am still digging into the side content and hope they continue to iron out its issues as time goes on. I cannot wait to see what is next from Mundfish, I just hope I don’t have to wait another decade to see it.",,,,,,,The pure pleasure of adventuring in this world as P3 is motivation enough to see this through to the end. [Impressions],,,,,,,,,,"Atomic Heart is not the October Revolution of video games. Most of the ideas, besides the unique premise, seem to be lifted from somewhere else, but that doesn't really matter as the basic mechanics are through-out and rewarding. Unfortunately, a host of smaller problems give the game a rough feel and keep it from realising its full potential. Still, if you love dense, atmospheric shooters or are hooked on the premise, then it's well worth taking a trip back to the USSR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
farming-simulator-22,"Sadly developers have yet to solve the inaccessibility for newcomers, as the learning curve is a sheer cliff to overcome. Still a niche genre, Farming Simulator 22 is a complex and accurate representation of real world farming, and while virtual farmers will no doubt spend over a thousand hours once again in the latest version, newcomers are still going to be left wondering how others could find the monotonous grind entertaining. Those that know, know, so let the good times grow.",,,,"Farming Simulator as a franchise just gets better with every new release and that’s the case with Farming Simulator 22. The purists and experts might argue that this hasn’t gone far enough, adding in just a few new features, but with cross-play multiplayer, the brilliant seasonal farming, and supply chains coming to console, there is certainly enough to keep those winter evenings flying by.",,"Farming Simulator 22 is an experience that does just enough to be entertaining, while being a little punishing to the newcomers of the franchise.",,,"Farming Simulator 22 manages to scratch the itch of any hardcore simulator fan looking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life for some time in an idyllic rural setting where they can raise livestock and produce. The mechanics can be a little convoluted for new players, but online multiplayer and a robust modding community can help anybody become an experienced farmhand.",,,,"Farming Simulator 22 has improved compared to previous releases. From small things like driving, which is still not perfect, to the physics that have to do with weight, terrain, and the type of machinery. There is also, of course, the new game mechanics that enrich the experience making it deeper. Its problems lie in how difficult it can be for a new player to understand what to do in the game, as well as how un-rewarding the game will be with your effort, are things that can discourage players and make them simply stop playing.",,,"If you've ever dreamt of owning your own farm, or simply ploughing, fertilising, spraying, and cultivating someone else's land, then Farming Simulator 22 will cater to your every whim and want. Newcomers beware, though – the barrier to entry is quite high.","While Farming Simulator 22 will undoubtedly appeal to fans of the series, newcomers may feel overwhelmed by the possibilities. However, it would be a shame to miss this episode since it corrects most of the faults of the previous part. Vehicle modeling is always more precise and the arrival of the seasons or even production lines is a real plus. Now it's up to you to see if you are ready to immerse yourself in this experience, which is as complete as it is difficult to master.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Farming Simulator 22 is a deep dive into the farming experience, giving players a lot of ways to make money if they're willing to put in the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
soulstice,"Far from a perfect game, Soulstice feels like it has a soul and some heart. Made by a smaller studio you can absolutely see the Devil May Cry and Bayonetta influences, and while it may not hit that level quite yet, it’s a great homage regardless, a game that should be enjoyed by fans of the genre.","Soulstice has great old school vibes but it may fall short of what it was trying to achieve. It can be frustrating at times and after a while I found it more frustrating than fun. For those who love DMC/Bayonetta, I’d definitely say give it a go, but beware that you will be sinking hours into the game.",,,"Soulstice feels like it is from another generation but it is still a good looking, modern game that plays well. The combat is fluid and challenging, the backdrops are amazing at times and the story is intriguing. However, Soulstice does get a bit 'cut and paste' after a while and getting to grips with the camera is always a hassle.",,"Soulstice is a classic hack’n slash, a solid technical section with some bugs, a frantic and dynamic combat and an interesting story. But with an excessive duration.",,,,,,"Soulstice combines a fascinating setting, two well-characterized protagonists, an engaging storyline and a gameplay that, albeit with a few smears, is capable of providing many hours of fun. It's not a perfect game, with the troublesome camera handling as its major flaw, but it's still a game that every lover of third-person action games should consider.","Soulstice is a good game that is marred by the occasional glitch, but it certainly offers a really fun gameplay experience. Despite asking for a greater variety of combos, it manages to offer a really fantastic hack & slash experience, something difficult to find outside the exponents of the genre.",,,,"With Soulstice, the developers at Reply Game Studios have probably created their most ambitious game. Nervous beat'em up set in a universe reminiscent of the Claymore manga, it plays on the duality of force fields (evocation, banishment) and a mix of exploration, puzzles and action for lovers of the genre. Unfortunately, the lack of means is felt over the length and we very often complain about a badly adjusted camera and obvious technical problems (slowdowns, excessive copy-paste, textures from another time, etc.). Not to mention this permanent juggling at the level of the side keys of the controller. In the end, Soulstice is a game far from being uninteresting, but which is reserved for fans of the genre and amateurs of scoring.","Soulstice is an interesting hack 'n slash title with a captivating plot. Focusing heavily on combat mechanics, the developers have delivered a slick and exciting adventure game. Furthermore, the excellent visuals and incredible audio help to set the scene.",,"Soulstice came out of nowhere for me and it is fantastic. Its mix of brilliant combat, an intriguing plot, great music, and occasionally gorgeous graphics had me hooked instantly. This could be the beginning of a great series and one excellent title you do not want to miss.",,,,,,,,,,"Concerning the gameplay and the narration, Soulstice does not beat around the bush and offers a wide-ranging adventure. The approach to combat and the fighting style you want to adopt are fully customisable. The progression and the feeling of a growing power are well represented. Unfortunately, we could not sweep under the rug the camera issues and level design shortcomings that marred our gameplay experience. We would recommend Sousltice to those absolutely fan of beat-them-all games who will undoubtedly be able to overlook the flaws that annoyed us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A solid game with good intentions, but a far cry from the biggest games in the genre.

On the flip side, the excessive chaos that arose during the battles, combined with a camera that we believe to be almost entirely redesigned, too often penalizes the reading of the action, complicating even the simplest challenges. Hoping that the Italian studio will roll up its sleeves to at least partially remedy the shortcomings of the product, we recommend its purchase to fans of heart-pounding clashes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The developers of Soulstice are clearly overflowing with ideas - but they should ask themselves whether all of them are good.

Maybe next time!",,,,,,,,"An experience not without many technical flaws, but which will nevertheless convince fans of the genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Soulstice the attempt by small developer Reply Games Studios to create a character action game in the style of Bayonetta and Devil May Cry. While neither as flashy nor deep as its bigger siblings, “Soulstice” offers a very solid foundation, an entertaining story, and enough depth to get you through a playthrough. It’s not the best the genre has to offer, but it’s an easy recommendation for anyone looking for a new action title on a budget.",,,,,,,"Soulstice is a solid outing that I wanted to love and recommend more. It borrows heavily from games like Bayonetta and Devil May Cry without fully capturing what makes those titles so special. Still for a fairly new developer taking a stab at the genre it is filled with promise and in an era where games are supported I hope a patch can sort out of some the minor issues over time. I had fun with the game and hope they continue to improve on their craft. I am always down for character action games and if you are like me and miss the days when these were a dime a dozen, Soulstice is likely right up your alley.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s a chaotic push and pull between ecstatic fun and dull annoyance that honestly drives Soulstice, but it’s nonetheless worth checking out.",,,,,,,,"Soulstice is an awesome ode to classic action-adventure games. It expertly wears its inspirations proudly while telling an impactful story full of epic battles. Sadly, there’s a missed opportunity to create tension with large-scale encounters in its early moments, but Soulstice comes together in its second act with a unique and fast action system that is beautifully choreographed across the gothic landscape. I hope this isn’t the last we see of Briar and Lute.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lawn-mowing-simulator,Even with its minor issues and lengthy grind it still made the cut.,"Lawn Mowing Simulator did something to me that I didn’t think possible by grabbing my attention so well I didn’t want to play other games for awhile.

If you have the slightest amount of curiosity about the game, I’d recommend it for sure.",,"When you add everything up though, including its lower price point of just £24.99 / $29.99, Lawn Mowing Simulator is a worthy purchase if you're keenly interested. The core gameplay is where it shines brightest, highlighted by intuitive driving controls, and the career mode is just about engaging enough to keep you invested — we'd just love to see a more in-depth version of it with multiplayer support in the inevitable Lawn Mowing Simulator 2.","Lawn Mowing Simulator is a brilliantly presented and perfectly designed sim experience. The attention to detail in terms of the vehicles and the varied locations manage to fully complement a solid management experience as well. The problem is that much like most sims, cutting grass day in, day out fast becomes tiresome, especially when you’re always on edge, trying to keep on top of the micromanaging side of things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In one sense, spending hours mowing virtual lawns in a game could be considered a ridiculous waste of time. But aside from being a satisfying management sim, the act of mowing lawns in Lawn Mowing Simulator can be surprisingly relaxing and maybe even a little inspiring. This isn’t a lawn mowing version of Formula One, where you play a plucky kid with a push mower dreaming of glory on a shiny, souped- up John Deere. But it’s also much more than a one-joke game. Lawn Mowing Simulation is a full-featured product with a very specific focus, and a pretty well-made one, at that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lawn Mowing Simulator does no more or less than its title.

It allows you to venture into some lovely environments and cut grass from the comfort of your armchair. If that sounds appealing to you then you’ll probably love it. It can be quite relaxing at times, and also rewarding when you devise an effective grass-cutting strategy. If you have a real life lawn though, you’ll probably feel like you should just go and cut that rather than spend time cutting virtual ones. My lawn isn’t big enough to be cut with a sit-on lawn mower, however, so that’s my excuse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s a hard one to describe, but I fell in love with the relaxed feel of this game. Sure, the business side of the game wasn’t the deepest and really all you’re doing is going back and forth on a lawn mower, but I would be lying if I did have a good time with the game and to the point of writing this review, have put over 20 hours into it. If you’re looking for a chill game to throw some music or a podcast on and just ride, you really can’t beat this game. It’s not going to throw some hard curveball at you. Sometimes, that exactly what you need. You may find yourself like me and have a nice, relaxing time with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A few niggles aside, Lawn Mowing Simulator is another game in the blossoming sim genre that takes workaday tasks and manages to create a zen, ASMR-esque experience that transcends boredom. This game certainly has a niche and won’t be for everyone but if might surprise you with how equally innocuous and engaging it is at the same time. Even for someone who hates mowing their lawn, I found this title to be enjoyable. If you’re looking for a new simulator in the same vein as Farming Simulator, House Flipper or Euro Truck, this certainly could be it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
trek-to-yomi,"The Flying Wild Hogs team brings stylish hard action in Trek to Yomi and it’s a very fun game to play through for the story and art style. You will be challenged more than a few times throughout the four-to-five-hour story, and in the end you will feel accomplished by beating it. It has its frustrating times, times that I had to set my controller down and walk away, but I always wanted to go back for more and retry the scene to move forward. It launches into Gamepass, so you really have no reason not to give it a try. I am confident you’ll like it.","Not too many games go above and beyond to pay homage to the past like Trek To Yomi does. From top to bottom it is drenched in a dedicated and unshakable inspiration of Japanese cinema, which does its absolute best to make players spellbound by its sheer level of deftly crafted artistic intent. Similarly, the combat is super slick, stylish and gratifyingly nuanced, that it will please many who beg for a finely-honed, lethal and precise katana-thrusting gameplay core. Unfortunately, the repetition of enemies and their compositions do get in the way as there isn’t enough diversity in the enemy variety nor the deviation to manipulate curiosity in interesting ways, but ultimately if you want a brief, beautiful and brutal action game, you should certainly take this trek.",,"Trek to Yomi is a game of two halves, where slightly repetitive combat does bring things down a notch. However, that other half — made up of the game's visuals, characters, storyline, atmosphere and overall polish — is so good that you'll want to carry on trekking right until the end. More involved combat could have elevated this one to being potentially one of our very favourite Game Pass games, but make no mistake, this is an adventure you'll want to head out on.","Perhaps it's a little short, and maybe the combat is a little one dimensional, but Trek To Yomi is a game that stands out from the crowd",,Trek to Yomi takes us to the samurai era with a captivating story and an artistic section worthy of the best movies.

Trek to Yomi is a katana-sharp experience that impresses with its flashy skills — use the joyous time it gives you well.",,"A stylish side-scrolling samurai epic, Trek to Yomi combines cinematic influences and sharp combat to great effect, but descends into frustration towards the end. Nonetheless, this is a journey worth sticking with.","Trek to Yomi is a very beautiful cinematographic work. It doesn't have to pale before the giants who inspired it. Its use of the camera and black and white grain allow it to present us with particularly sumptuous paintings. Add to that some eye-popping fight choreography and you've got a little nugget of artistic mastery. If a game was judged by this, Trek to Yomi would undoubtedly top the charts. But unfortunately, the game is, in comparison, too little pushed in terms of gameplay. Its superfluous choices and its repetitive fights prevent it from expressing his full potential. That said, it is still worth the detour and even more so if you are sensitive to this kind of video game work.","Trek to Yomi is a beautiful and sombre title that is full of death and destruction.

Preferably on a big screen with good sound.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Trek To Yomi is a visual gem that isn't entirely convincing on a gameplay level.,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite its repetition and frustrations, I warmed to this grainy, gore-soaked journey after the tedious early hours. Thanks to a smattering of player choices, the game offers just enough of a hint at player agency to make you feel involved in the narrative, too, giving Trek to Yomi’s surrealist slaughter a sense of purpose. There’s a strong argument that a Japanese-made attempt at this genre would come closer to doing the samurai fantasy justice, but as with the many Japanese takes on virtual America, there’s a schlocky charm to Yomi’s tropey inauthenticity nonetheless.","Trek to Yomi is not an overly long adventure either. Outside of the standard combat there is some light exploration and puzzle solving with a few boss battles tossed in for good measure. The story is what kept me chugging through to the end. It is boilerplate but interesting. I wanted to know how things concluded so I pushed through the repetitive combat. Trek to Yomi is a game that on the surface seems way more interesting than it actually is. It feels like a good Game Pass title that occupied me for a weekend, I just wish it was a bit more in-depth when it comes to the combat itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Trek To Yomi is graphically and audibly amazing. The story is rich and full with a lot of history. If you want to sink a few hours into a beat-em-up with a lot of depth and lots to do, you should definitely play this.

thymesia,,"Thymesia is a game that has a story as complex as the pronunciation of the title itself. If a brutally tough game that puts your reflexes, memory and patience to the test like many Dark Souls-type games then there is some joy for you here. The combat is tricky to master but fast and fluid. If you are willing to commit yourself to the game and repetition doesn’t phase you then I would recommend you try this out.",,"Thymesia has all the ingredients necessary to make for a solid indie Soulslike experience, but it falls short due to messy implementation of mechanics, bland level design, weak lore and issues with difficulty balancing. There are some really neat ideas here, for sure, with the game's plague weapons providing lots of variety in how you go about dealing with your enemies, but unnecessary and awkward elements such as an overly tricky deflection system and dodge mechanics that need tightening up sully the overall combat experience. With a little more TLC this could have been a banger, but as things stand it's a fairly average effort that's hard to recommend if you're not a huge fan of the genre.","Thymesia doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the Souls-like world, but what it does do, it does very well.",,"Thymesia is a very interesting game, with combat and gameplay that will remind us of Sekiro, but with its own personality. In addition, the design of maps and bosses are spectacular, as is their artistic design. However, to the soundtrack, the lack of epic nature.",,,,,"Thymesia is a challenging title that is a MUST play for FromSoftware fans, an accomplishment for a debut title from a small studio.","Thymesia sports a compelling story coupled by an intriguing souls-like combat system, but it's constrained by excessively linear levels and complete lack of any dubbing. Regardless, if you're looking for a challenging action game, you should definitely give it a chance.","Thymesia is a game that, without being a revolution in its genre, offers and has very varied elements that provide the player with a truly entertaining journey, with fast and addictive mechanics.",,,,,"Thymesia is the latest title to try and be the next Soulsborne experience. Sadly, its lofty ideas fall short and its potential is never reached. On top of this, a lack of originality holds it back throughout.",,"Unfortunately The game's terrible parry system, lack of variety in its weapons, and incredibly frustrating feather stun move compound into a game that I struggled to enjoy, despite my best efforts.",,,,,,,,,,"Do not expect it to be a worthy contender to Dark Souls: Thymesia simply draws its inspirations from the latter while proposing its own, more nervous and dynamic formula. With the help of his sword and ancestral weapons, the hero gifts the player with some particularly memorable fights and moves that every respectable swordsman should try for himself. It is a shame the adventure is a tad short.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Thymesia may look like an Indie-Developer trying to do Bloodborne, but it ends up being more than that. Thymesia seamlessly blends the fast, often frantic combat of games like Devil May Cry with a more thoughtful approach, giving the players the tools to quickly leap between enemies, while strategically switching between light and heavy attacks, as well as flashy specials. While regular combat is often a fun power fantasy, the game truly shines in its boss fights, where two equally deadly warriors dance around each other parrying and trading blows. The only sore spot in the gameplay is that there isn’t already a Thymesia 2 to sink my teeth into.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
monster-truck-championship,"While it has some good ideas, its execution still feels sloppy and having to rebuy the game again for a slightly prettier version on Xbox Series X for early adopters might leave a bad taste in some mouths, especially when many other publishers and games are offering the free upgrades. While it may not have the licensed trucks we’ve come to love in real life, Monster Truck Championship for Xbox Series X does entertain in short bursts when you get a hang of how to control these 2000hp monstrosities, plus it's the most visually appealing and best performing version of the game if you've not played previously.",,,,"Monster Truck Championship on Xbox Series X|S remains a solid sim racer, with plenty of events to tackle.

Considering the polish of this title, I can see it getting the sequel treatment in due time. I would recommend this motorsport game to anyone who likes monster trucks and/or Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater. While I’m excited to see the return of live motorsport events.

hot-wheels-unleashed,,"If you’re looking for a new way to jump into the world of Hot Wheels, Unleashed is certainly not a bad way to go, after all, we’ve seen worse in the series’ history. That said, the price point may prove steep for what feels like a more basic use of this beloved licensed property, and with very basic options for included game modes, a lack of substantial variety in race types, and no suitable way for the community to share their impressive track builds, it feels like Milestone has undercut themselves in a possibly rushed attempt to capitalise on this potentially fruitful racing franchise.",,,"Hot Wheels Unleashed is a decent effort at bringing the iconic brand into the video game scene for real. It’s able to deliver a wide variety of cars and tracks to gamers in a way that is fast and frantic, seeing it occasionally verge on being a really great arcade racer.

Still, said fans may find that the dedication to the brand here elevates the experience to a degree, although those with less love for Hot Wheels in general might just see this passable racer as more of a slightly cynical vessel through which to peddle pretend toy cars for the next few years. Shiny and on-brand, but nothing particularly special, honestly.",,"A cracking little arcade racer from a studio better acquainted with motorcycle sims, Hot Wheels Unleashed is like sticking both hands into a big toy box of die-cast cars, pulling them all out, then thrashing them around a racetrack. And what is there not to like about that?","It remains an effective game, quite enjoyable and is without doubt the one that most faithfully respects the spirit of the famous brand, with that same nostalgic and passionate vision that we could have had ourselves, a few years earlier.",,,,,"Hot Wheels Unleashed is a good addition to the world of racing games, with enough to make it totally unique but not too much to overcomplicate it. There are a few things I wish would make it feel more full, but for what it does deliver, it delivers it well.","I was absolutely impressed by how much of a full-fledged racing game Hot Wheels Unleashed is. It’s right at home with some of the better arcade racers on the market today, and offers up a whole lot of fun for the whole family, regardless of whether you’re a Hot Wheels fan or not. The track customization is pretty solid, with a decent enough opening tutorial to get you started, and the sheer number of vehicles you can obtain right out of the gate is pretty impressive. The multiplayer could use a bit more fleshing out, but at least works great, and the game controls fantastically overall. If you’ve been in the mood for a new racing experience that everyone can enjoy, then look no further than Hot Wheels Unleashed.",,,,,,,"Hot Wheels Unleashed is quite a positive surprise. It gained our attention when it was first announced and after testing it, we can easily say we’re impressed. Thanks to its 100% arcade gameplay and its easy handling, one is immediately having fun. Content-wise, the game is quite generous, both in terms of the number of cars and tracks available. The latter are a real success, magnified by superb lighting effects. The only downside is that collisions with the environment and opponents lack impact. Nevertheless, Milestone delivers a beautiful copy that will delight both young and old gamers.",,,,,,"I enjoyed playing Hot Wheels Unleashed a lot. The racing is straight up fun thanks to a top notch handling model that really makes the most of some impressive powersliding mechanics. But I can't help but wonder what could have been had we not got a game brimming with DLC and tied, to its detriment, to uninspired track environments.",,"Hot Wheels Unleashed gets its racing and assortment of cars so very right, but the way you go about unlocking more content is unfathomably restrictive and leads to frustration.",,,,"This is the kind of game a cheap uncle buys a kid for Christmas out of the bargain bin giving little thought beyond, “little Timmy likes cars so I’ll buy him this thing.” Sadly, it will only keep kids entertained for as long as it takes them to realise the odds are stacked against them.

It’s just a shame it’s largely hidden from the outset.",,,,Hot Wheels Unleashed is one of the best arcade racers to release on modern consoles in years. Tight controls and action-packed races make for a fun and satisfying racer that offers intense racing and a lot of ways to play.,"Hot Wheels Unleashed feels less like a cohesive racing experience and more like a framework where more and more Hot Wheels branded content can live as the months go on. This comes through not only in the lackluster presentation but in the currency system that robs players of any sense of urgency to complete missions. It doesn't feel satisfying to go through an hour of races and grind up currency to get a single box that contains a duplicate of an already-unlocked car. Instead of unlocking cars like heroes in Overwatch, the game operates as a video slot machine. While there's no way as of this writing to purchase currency with real-world money, the entire system feels tailor-made to support exactly that kind of philosophy. At that point, it might be a better investment to simply pick up some actual Hot Wheels and just watch them zoom around the track in real life.",,,"Hot Wheels Unleashed captures the magic of plastic cars with fast and smooth racing, but the toy box is a little shallow. There are numerous maps and cars, but the limited amount of environments, music, and set-pieces make for an experience that starts to get old quickly. As a result, Hot Wheels Unleashed rides the high of its racing, which feels like butter when drifting around corners and speeding through loop-the-loops, using whichever food truck or licensed car you pull out of the blind box, but doesn't bring enough of the license's personality over.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, I can look past the grind of obtaining new cars thanks to everything else Hot Wheels Unleashed does. I loved its commitment to the memory of racing around my bedroom floor, and for those looking for an accessible arcade-style racer full of personality and flair, look no further.",,,,,,"Hot Wheels Unleashed is a game that tugs at my nostalgia for collecting these cars. I just wish the aggressive DLC plans and grinding for new cars didn’t sour that experience so much. When I was playing I was having a blast. The track design and handling are superb and when I got a new rare car I was super excited. Hopefully they tweak some of the requirements for unlocking cars and I hope the season passes are not overly priced for their own good. I would love to see this game flourish and become a staple of arcade racers. It feels like a renaissance of the genre, and I want Unleashed to be there for a long time coming.",,,,,,,"Hot Wheels Unleashed is up there with Milestone’s MotoGP and Monster Energy Supercross, as well as the F1 and WRC games, as another winner in the ongoing renaissance of licensed motorsports gaming. For those who are perhaps not dedicated motorsports or sim racing fans, it could be a strong contender for their racing game of the year. I’ve become a virtual gearhead over the past four years, and Hot Wheels Unleashed is at least in the discussion for mine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"On the track, there’s a decent little racer in Hot Wheels Unleashed. Everything else feels like a bit of a letdown.",,,,,"Hot Wheels Unleashed is a decent racer with some excellent surrounding elements. It lacks the strategy and realism of a sim, but doesn’t hit the over-the-top chaos and action of an arcade racer either.

twelve-minutes,,"I could talk for ages about Twelve Minutes as I loved everything about it, but there’s not much that can be said without spoilers. The voice acting is fantastic and the gameplay is very enjoyable. It’s a fantastic title and the fact it comes straight to Game Pass is brilliant. I can’t recommend this enough.",,"All in all, then, Twelve Minutes is definitely worth a download with Xbox Game Pass if you're even the least bit interested in the premise, as both its story and gameplay combine to create a memorable thriller. There are a couple of downsides if you look for them, and the replayability factor will be pretty low after you've discovered everything, but we think you'll really enjoy your main playthrough regardless, even if you're not the biggest fan of point-and-click games.","Ultimately, I had a good time with Twelve Minutes. It's a game that is able to usher forth a great narrative experience and a refreshing change of pace. It's one to give a whirl through Game Pass as while it won't be for everyone, it will connect with a lot of people.",,Twelve Minutes creates an immersive experience that will glue you to the screen until the mystery of its story is revealed. A heavy-hitter for this Summer on Xbox Game Pass.,,,,,,,Twelve Minutes is an essential game for fans of good stories and also for those nostalgic for point-and-click adventures. Its voice cast is magnificent and helps elevate its excellent story.,"Although the main mechanic of the gameplay loop can become a little frustrating and repetitive nearer the end of the game, and the story can begin to feel a little muddled, Twelve Minutes unravels its mysteries so well as to leave you pondering long after you finish the game — I’m still trying to wrap my head around the ending, and I know I’ll be thinking about it for a long time to come.",,,"Combined with a concept that is both seductive and risky, the plot of 12 Minutes easily maintains interest even in its elements of resolution. Also if one feels Luis Antonio's imperfections in terms of technique, his learning from the great thrillers of cinema is just as visible. But the title divides between the frustration that can cause redundant loops and the quite captivating atmosphere of the place. If the game is as accessible in its mechanics as thorny in its timed puzzles, the experience will naturally be smoother for those able to progress by limiting loops.",,,,,Twelve Minutes is a truly phenomenal experience hindered only by forgivable a few gameplay bumps and the immense patience it takes to succeed.,,"Despite not being a natural fit on console, Twelve Minutes provides a consistently engaging story that kept me tied to my controller until the very end. A strong voice cast and interesting central conceit make it worth checking out, especially if you can play it for no additional cost via Game Pass. I’m still not sure the story fully comes together, but it provided enough to think about that I know I won’t stop thinking about it anytime soon.","Twelve Minutes is a production that stands out for its originality and what it wants to do, but the dialogue should have been more diverse.",,,,,,,"12 minutes is a point’n’click thriller playing with a time loop theme with a great premise and introductory setting, but with a lack of interactivity and an unfortunate story. After the enthusiasm from the beginning of the game, when you will enjoy the offered possibilities of the game sandbox, frustration and disappointment will come. Even dabing with brilliant actors is not helping the game. It seems to be recorded in a hurry and without the possibility for the actors to get used to the character.",,,"Twelve Minutes is a videogame that is fantastic in every area, except being a videogame. There’s a lot to love, and I think people will overlook its faults.

It won’t wear out your Gamepass though, so give it at least twelve minutes of your time if you’re a member of the Microsoft gameclub.",,,,,,"An intriguing concept makes for a decent story with a messy ending. The input lag makes playing Twelve Minutes a bit of a chore, though. Shame, cause there's definitely some good to be salvaged.",,,"You can't just not enjoy being stuck in a time-loop with some interesting puzzles, with 12 Minutes you'll find yourself in a mysterious thriller that will just keep you asking for more.","I would not call Twelve Minutes just an experiment, because the result is convincing in every aspect and the perfectible parts are absolutely minor. The experience packaged by Luis Antonio and Annapurna is another excellent example of the possibilities that videogames can offer, both in narrative and interactive terms.","Twelve Minutes is one of the best indie experiences of the year. History and freedom for the player are its strengths. Still, there are a number of decisions that affect the bottom line.",,"12 Minutes is deliberately obtuse and requires us to use our imagination to the fullest. In the end we are going to take an extremely cloudy, but memorable story, worthy of a Black Mirror chapter, with delicious aesthetic and a handful of decisions that will keep us pondering.",,,,,"Inventive adventure thriller, that produces a lot of tense moments within the limited scenario. The solution doesn't meet expectations, though.",,,,,,,"Great idea woefully executed. The story, gripping at first, soon devolves into frustrating repetition. The characters just aren’t interesting enough and the A-list actors offer what might just be the blandest performances of their careers. Spend your twelve minutes elsewhere.",,,"12 Minutes is a special game. The time loop game design is put together very eloquently, even if there are slight hiccups that can get frustrating. The voice actors do an excellent job of pulling together the tense narrative, and there is always the feeling that the next clue will be what unearths this unimaginable mystery. While the game's visuals leave some room to be desired, the art style and vibe make up for it. There is always an underlying eerie tone in 12 Minutes that goes even beyond the horrors within the apartment walls and those 720 seconds. And that rings forever true in the chilling ending to 12 Minutes.",,,,,,,,,,,"Warren Spector, director of Deus Ex, has said that he would like to make a game focused entirely on one city block because the small space would allow for unmatched mechanical depth. 12 Minutes reduces Spector's scope further, and finds a rich vein for interaction and storytelling. This game may limit its loop to 12 minutes, but I found myself wishing I could stay for much, much longer.",,,,,"I really wanted to like 12 Minutes. It's a compelling concept, but the game's rigid structure and lack of options make it feel less like a game about a time loop and more like a narrative adventure where I kept having to sit through ""Game Over"" screens because I didn't make the specific choice necessary. As a result, it feels like the most irksome elements of Capcom's Ace Attorney series, without the rewarding aspects. At times, I was genuinely surprised by the options made available to me, but far more often, I found myself feeling like the game's concept was basically just window dressing. 12 Minutes feels far too limited for its concept, and that makes the game feel like a chore far more often than not.","Intriguing point-and-click game with a dense atmosphere, however, it struggles with some issues.",,,,,"Twelve Minutes can't fully satisfy the great expectations the game causes on its reveal.

The question is: Do we care?",,,,,,,,,,"Twelve Minutes tries to do something very specific, and in many ways it succeeds. There are few games where solving a mystery feels so playful and organic, and the game does a great job at creating tension. My heart always started racing when I heard the elevator open in the hallway, knowing the cop was about to barge in. But those good parts are muddied by the often tedious structure and an ending that is more unbelievable than shocking. Your enjoyment will depend mostly on your tolerance for repetition — and if you have any mystery-loving friends to follow along.",,,,,,,,,,,"Twelve Minutes is a game that allows the player to experience what life is like for a protagonist caught in a time loop. While spending the same 12 minutes in a small apartment over and over might not sound too epic, the loop cycle is well done and has something new for the player to discover each time. That being said, the game’s story and theme aren’t as well executed. In many ways, Twelve Minutes is a game with a truth you might be better off not knowing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Some devilishly clever puzzles shine in a unique take on the point-and click genre, but the game waits to the end to make its story truly interesting, which might be a little late if you're looking for an emotional investment to get you through some of the more tedious moments.",,,,Twelve Minutes feels like Something Awful copypasta wearing the skin of an Ibsen play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, the characters are colourful and zany, but the building mechanics and camera angles are terrible.","Bricktales is a slightly different game from the previous LEGO titles, that puts “construction” and “creativity” right in the center of the experience. Not a masterpiece but definitely an enjoyable one.","So LEGO: Brick Tales then – a bright, colourful and certainly more creative take on LEGO in its digital form. While there’s some fiddly controls at times, it’s all quite charming and relaxing – and as the rest of the package is so wonderfully put together, it’s hard to gripe too much about a fussy control scheme. Besides, back in my day, I never used a manual to build my spaceship, and had to spend quite some time searching for just the right brick to make the whole thing work. Either way, it was a great dose of nostalgia.",,,,,,,,,,,"Bricktales is perfect – for the right audience. The trouble is, I’m not sure who that audience is. The visuals and the writing feel very all-ages. But the puzzle design requires a high degree of patience and perseverance. I’m neither a parent nor a child, however.

destroy-all-humans!-2---reprobed,,"Destroy All Humans 2 Reprobed in my opinion is better than the original due to the fact that there is more for players to do as it has more variety. While the game takes a more goofy and playful tone to the whole “conquer the human race” trope, it still proves itself to be a fun experience that any player should try out.",,"Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed is exactly what you'd expect, a sprucing up of a game that's so obviously from another era it can be painful at times. However, strip some of that back and the core idea is pretty fun and still works on a basic level, albeit with a few caveats as mentioned. If you played the old version and have some nostalgia for it, this remake will no-doubt scratch that itch and take you back, but those after a more comprehensive 'remake' of such an effort will probably be left wanting a bit more modernisation. It's time to retire the probe for another 15 years, then.","Destroy All Humans! 2 – Reprobed is bold, brash and bombastic but somehow still works in a world which has changed significantly, even if the game fundamentally remains the same as before.",,"Destroy all Humans 2: Reprobed catches us in a great funny, spicy and frantic story.

If you want to destroy, take out people's brains, use crazy weapons to finish off your enemies, this game is what you are looking for. As a remake, Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed manages to technically update the original game, although I think it could have been renewed more in essence, taking more risks. Of course, those who are looking for the improved version of the classic, here you will have what you are looking for. It's a game that appeals only to fun and doesn't have much depth. But that's exactly why it works for those who like this kind of games.",,,"It's slightly upsetting how close Destroy All Humans! 2 – Reprobed is to being a properly good remake. Were it not for the parade of annoying bugs and the occasional crummy mission, this would be easy to recommend. In its current, messy state, however, Black Forest's latest effort falls.","Those who had tasted the previous remake will be delighted to learn that Destroy All Humans 2 Reprobed corrects many shots: the experience is based on a funnier and denser narration, on a rich gameplay and an overall feeling more fluid, more modern. This is obviously due to the original game which, at the time in 2006, had been able to rise a level but the redesign work is also appreciable: the graphic aspect sometimes delivers some nice surprises, despite bugs and problems techniques to highlight. We had a frankly pleasant time and in its finality, this second adventure testifies to a very good mood to be devoured without moderation.","Destroy all Humans! 2 - Reprobed is an amusing smutty title. You must control Crypto and seek revenge against the KGB. En route, you encounter some weird and eclectic people. Befriend some of them, but leave behind the people that hold you back.","Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed was fun, irreverent and explosive, and with this remake it’s even larger than before. There are some technical problems to solve and unfortunately the missions are too similar to the past, still it’s quite enjoyable.","As a remake of a 2006 title is one of the best looking to date.

Beyond dialogue, updates to gameplay and graphics feel hollow when game-breaking bugs are still prevalent…That isn’t to say you won’t find fun here. But that fun may just be restricted to a 10-12 hour jaunt through memory lane.",,,,,,,,"A worthy successor to the remake released in 2020, Destroy All Humans 2! - Reprobed has all the same ingredients, but makes a better recipe out of it. The graphics are beautiful, and the locations we visit all around the Earth and beyond are all well designed. The humour is still present; the narrative still cleverly written; the handling is ideal, and Crypto’s overwhelming power can still give us chills. If you enjoyed the first opus, do not hesitate: planet Earth will welcome you with open arms to scourge some humans. The Furons are superior to the human race and it is your time to shine!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Crazy shootings, a successful script that mixes comedy with clichés, and last but not least, a graphic restoration of the highest level, make Destroy All Humans! 2 Reprobed an excellent remake that we are convinced will be able to entertain both those who have already loved the saga, as well as the players who have never approached it before. Unfortunately the title suffers from a somewhat repetitive mission structure typical of the open world of sixteen years ago, but overall it still manages to engage the user thanks to an immediacy that has become damn rare these days.",,,,,,,"The judgment on Destroy All Humans 2: Reprobed is very similar to that given for the remake of the first episode, two years ago: a game that under a renewed graphics doesn't bring anything new compared to its original incarnation. A nice and light pastime for those who miss the series or for those who have never approached it. Excessive ease is its biggest flaw, because it leaves wide prairies to boredom when you realize that it all boils down to a series of tasks to be done with the brain off, and comic skits that make the cinema verse of the '50 and '60.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Destroy All Humans 2 Reprobed is a beautifully done remake of a cult classic that fans are sure to enjoy.

I would love to finally see a new game now, do NOT remake Big Willy Unleashed…I beg you. As it stands this latest remake is great, I just wonder how well it will do being limited to only new consoles as well as PC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Destroy All Humans! 2 - Reprobed brings the original title into the modern age, and while the gameplay is massively improved, some bad ideas, dated jokes, and an abundance of glitches mar the overall experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although at first glance it may seem like a title created solely and exclusively for fan service, the reality is that we are facing a great cooperative title tremendously addictive and fun, loaded with scares, dismemberments, and above all, blood, a lot of blood. Indispensable in the library of any fan of Evil Dead and lovers of Dead By Daylight style games.","Evil Dead is back with an interesting asymmetric action game that doesn’t do anything new, but knows how to deliver fun battles to its fans.",,"Solo players will likely be disappointed by the content offered here, but if you have a squad of dedicated friends who enjoy sinking their teeth into class-based meta, there’s so much to love with this gory, campy, and mesmerizing video game.",,,"Evil Dead: The Game shows remarkable potential and incredible fidelity to Sam Raimi's work, with engaging PvP and PvE dynamics especially when played with friends. There is no lack of flaws such as overly repetitive content, some technical problems and an underdeveloped single player mode, but Saber Interactive's title remains an enjoyable act of love for Sam Raimi's work that every fan should try.","Evil Dead: The Game is a great asymmetrical game. It's fun in both roles and has a lot of content, but it still has several issues to fix.",,,"Offering a good dose of blood and viscera for gorehounds and more than ample fan service for Evil Dead heads, Evil Dead: The Game is a solid entry to the 4v1 horror genre, let down ever so slightly by repetitive objectives and slightly annoying solo missions. Putting that to one side, what Saber has created here is pretty... groovy.","Magnificent tribute to the saga that inspired it, Evil Dead: The Game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game that surprises with its constant dynamism and frenetic action very well staged. Unfortunately, the software quickly turns in circles. Despite the multitude of playable characters and the two gameplays offered (survivor or demon), Saber Interactive's game does not manage to diversify its approaches. A production that primarily targets fans of the genre and the cinematographic creations of Sam Raimi.","Evil Dead: The Game is a homage to 80s horror and Sam Raimi. It captures the franchise perfectly and you'll grimace and chuckle as the action unfolds. It is excellent as a multiplayer experience. However, solo gamers will find it unfairly harsh and this will frustrate you.",,Graphically the game looks average at best. It is a muddy and grimy-looking affair. The lighting system works well for the dark settings but a lot of the texture work for the environment and some of the enemies look last gen.,,"Evil Dead: The Game is a blast. It’s fun to play, difficult in spots, and something I can see myself returning to again and again just to keep exploring and learning, as well as unlocking new things as I’m sure they’ll become available over the games’ lifespan. Plus, for Deadites out there, it’s beyond a great buy with lore plugged into just about every design choice, line of dialogue, and piece of the landscape. So pick it up and all the king baby.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s sometimes a little rough around the edges, but there are some amazing selling points when it comes to Evil Dead. It has the look, feel and sound of proceedings down pat, even down to the movement of the evil presence as it stalks Ash and his friends in the cold, dark woods...Priced at $60 AUD, it’s a little too underdeveloped to recommend as a single-player game, but Evil Dead fans who don’t mind online play will find themselves dropping hours and hours into this. Those who enjoy 4v1 games will certainly enjoy this as well.","Evil Dead: The Game is another solid product based on a movie license that offers a good time for fans of the series and newcomers alike, but don’t expect it to knock your socks off beyond that.",,,,"Evil Dead: The Game is an awesome asymmetric multiplayer game that, like its source material, is far better than it has any right to be given its frustrating lack of polish and being somewhat light on maps and modes. Playing as a survivor is a fantastic cooperative shooter experience despite frequent problems with janky level geometry that leads to unfair deaths and other questionable design choices, while playing as the evil mastermind is just downright magnificent thanks to the amusingly fiendish ways you can mess with the other team. The single-player story missions are a distressing mess that I could have done without being forced to play through for unlocks, but everything else proves worthy of the classic cheesy movies that inspired it.",,,"Evil Dead: The Game is a great concept for an asymmetrical multiplayer game, but poor combat and terrible balancing makes it hard to recommend.",,,,,,,,,"The good news is future updates can address most of my more minor gripes, but the game is an unbalanced mess at release.

While I’m getting close to spending thirty hours with it, I’m still having a lot of fun and do not want to stop anytime soon. Some little niggles that will no doubt be fixed, such as certain button prompts not working immediately, are outshone by what is an otherwise robust and cross-play enabled netcode.",,,"Despite presenting a number of interesting ideas, Evil Dead: The Game is an experience that quickly becomes monotonous. Not even Bruce Campbell's charisma can exorcise this game of his problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Saber Interactive, to the surprise of many, has released a very good game for Evil Dead fans.",,,,,,,,,,"Evil Dead: The Game is faithful, but sometimes to a fault. If there were more game modes or even more varied objectives in its one attractive game mode, it would feel more like a game for horror fans to play for a long time, maybe even moving competitors like Dead By Daylight or Hunt Showdown off their vaunted pedestals. As it stands at launch, however, Evil Dead only reaches beyond something pretty good when it's played with a close-knit group of Evil Dead fans. General horror or co-op enthusiasts may get some mileage out of it, but Ash and his boomstick are storming into a crowded field of competitors and can't quite overcome the horde of similar games already available.",,,,,,,,,,,"Evil Dead: The Game gets enough things right to be enjoyable for a week or two, especially if you’re nostalgic for the franchise. However, it doesn’t offer enough content and variety, especially on the survivor’s side to entertain for a long time. The meager single player challenges hide some neat unlocks but are ultimately more tedious than fun and don’t even come close to make this a viable product for those looking for a purely offline experience. As an online 4v1 asymmetric survival game it brings just enough new to the table to warrant a recommendation without really impressing in any particular area.",,,,,,,"The gameplay loop in Evil Dead: The Game is so satisfying it can scratch two different type of genre itches. On the one hand you have the survivor game play, which plays out like a mix between a battle royale and a horde mode. Then you have the demon gameplay, which is almost like a tower-defense style RTS with its use of needing a resource to place units and traps around the fields. And then because why not; let’s throw an RPG system in here so people can level up skills and tweak their gameplay styles to what works for them. Beyond just the systems though much like the source material, Evil Dead: The Game is just fun. Even when the game is invoking ‘jump scares’ (of which there are a ton) heck, even when losing I still had a ball and was excited to try and take down evil again. And with a promised new map based on Castle Kandar from ‘Army of Darkness and a noticeably absent Ruby from the Ash vs Evil Dead show; I think its safe to say that the team has Saber is going to keep us battling the Evil Dead for quite some time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Surprisingly good 4v1 game, which has a bit long matches and an unnecessarily large map, but in terms of gameplay it is good. It has depth, an impressive atmosphere and additional single player content.",,,,,,,,"If you’re a fan of Evil Dead, this game is meant for you. It’s easy to see that the developers are fans of the series as well. Even if you’re not a fan, this game is still a lot of fun. It is one the most balanced asymmetrical game that has released yet. There were a few problems with melee canceling when the game first released, but that exploit has already been addressed in one of the recent patches, so it goes to show that the developers care about balance. The game also has cross-play! If the game can maintain some good download content in the future, this game will be one to talk about and play for the months to come. Just from the start, this game already has “JOIN US” wrote all over it... and if you get that reference, you will enjoy this game the most!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The game’s faithfulness to its brutal and campy source material isn’t enough to make up for a litany of bugs and problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This is good but it could have been great.

While being aimed at fans of the animated series, SD Gundam Battle Alliance is probably one of the best gateways to getting started in the Mobile Suit Gundam universe.",,,"This game reminds me of another Bandai Namco-published series, God Eater, in a lot of aspects. From mission setup down to multiplayer progression and level design. I think if you like those games, you’ll find fun in BATTLE ALLIANCE. And despite the grinding, there’s enough content to go over for in a single campaign playthrough with a season pass (sold separately, of course) of content that will come later.

Ditching many modern sensibilities, such as complex game systems, deep customizability or even a coherent, emotional story, SD Gundam Battle Alliance can feel like a relic lost in time. The easy to learn and hard to master combat system that’s largely learned by bashing your head against an increasingly unfair difficulty curve is incredibly satisfying to learn. In time we combo together ranged and melee attacks, juggling our opponents with ease only to get completely crushed by the next boss until we find the right combination of skills, upgrades and gundam to best even the hardest foe. While not without its flaws, SD Gundam Battle Alliance is a celebration of a storied franchise and its particular style of gameplay, executed with style and charm.",,,,,,,SD Gundam: Battle Alliance is definitely a game that is created for the fans. From the roster of over 60 mobile suits (with more to be added via DLC) across the entirety of the series almost 50-year run its clear to see the passion and work that the team at Artddink poured into this game. The easier combat is complemented by the cutesy art style that the SD universe allows and even though I would prefer a more traditional Gundam experience; I must admit I had a really good time with this game. Even with the lack of an English dub and the easier combat SD Gundam: Battle Alliance may not win over any new fans to the series but for those fans who have been yearning for a new Gundam game this is one that is made for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The title has a select audience and may isolate newcomers to the series, but with the direct to Game Pass release it is an easy recommendation to subscribers because it works EXTREMELY well.","Rainbow Six Extraction is an excellent example of how to evolve and diversify a saga without denaturalizing it. Siege's well-tested structure is effectively flanked by new mechanics designed for cooperative play, allowing the game to differentiate itself enough from the dense competition. All this is made more interesting by a good progression system and extra modes, ensuring a more than satisfactory longevity to the title. Definitely worth a try for anyone looking for a new co-op FPS experience.",,"As much as I enjoy the moment-to-moment gameplay of Rainbow Six Extraction and have had a blast with it both solo and in co-op, it's impossible to overlook the glaring balance issues and lack of any kind of appealing endgame it has at the moment. Ubisoft does have a great track record for turning decent games into great ones in the long run — just look at Siege or The Division — so I'm hoping we'll see a similarly impressive evolution here eventually. For now, though, Extraction is undeniably entertaining in the short term, but it's the long game that worries me, and I'd love to be proven wrong. When everything comes together here, Extraction somehow manages to capture everything that is great about the Rainbow Six series while also taking by far the most liberties with its premise and structure. That's got to count for something.",,"While it has a few nice ideas, Rainbow Six Extraction is nonetheless a generic first-person shooter that feels more like an expansion, rather than a full-blooded game. I’m not entirely sure Tom Clancy would approve.","The greatest strong point of Extraction is undoubtedly to succeed in brilliantly mixing two distinctly different universes: on the one hand, the ultra-calculated military aspect of the Rainbow Six saga and, on the other, the tireless fashion of infected (or zombies) which has been attacking our favorite hobby for years.",,"Fierce and hostile, Rainbow Six Extraction is a solid co-op shooter that updates Siege's phenomenal gunplay with lots of original new ideas.",,,"At a price point of $40, Rainbow Six Extraction is definitely a game I'll be playing with my friends.",,"While I do have reservations about how long we’ll be playing this game for, as well as mechanics that got left behind, given Ubisoft’s commitment to Rainbow Six Siege, and how much they’ve continued to support and add to that game, I’ve no doubt that they’ll do the same with Rainbow Six Extraction. A year or two from now, I’m certain we’ll have a compelling reason to continue playing this game…Evaluating what we have right now, I think it’s a great price for a great game, so, as long as you’ve got two friends to play with, you’re going to have a blast. And if you've made it all the way down here, and want to know if Lord Tachanka's mounted machine gun still chugga-chugga's, well, comrade, it does, it most certainly does.",,,,,,,,,,,"Rainbow Six Extraction feels more like an expansion for Six Siege than a standalone game.

It perfectly captures the tactical gameplay of Siege in a non-competitive environment.,"Rainbow Six Extraction is a mixed bag of good ideas and weak implementations. It’s unfortunate that the bad manages to outweigh the good, because underneath it all, Rainbow Six Extraction's gameplay approach holds promise. It’ll be interesting to see how Ubisoft supports this title in the weeks and months to come, but it’s really hard to see how it can fix a lot of core issues within the game.","Rainbow Six Extraction can offer you a solid gameplay foundation, and many hours of fun tactical action.

Just how long this feeling continues to linger at the back of my mind, ultimately comes down to whether any post-launch updates will come to the progression to make it feel more rewarding and less grinding.",,"Though the story is weak and the design of the game favors certain characters, Extraction is a good Rainbow Six game that rewards you and your team's ability to adapt to deliver a compelling gameplay loop.",,,,"Rainbow Six Extraction ran the risk of being labelled as an expansion or an unnecessary spinoff, but confidently proves that there is more than enough room in this universe for a survival horror tactical shooter built on the foundations laid down by Siege. With a mixture of enjoyable objectives, a diverse range of Operators and a compelling gameplay loop filled with aggressive enemies and intense action, the addictive nature of the experience shines through with a constant struggle between playing it safe or risking it all for greater reward. Rainbow Six Extraction is full of truly exciting and memorable moments, continually testing your skill and perseverance around every dark corner, which makes it an incredibly gripping experience that doesn’t let go easily.","If you're looking for a solo shooter that will keep your attention, you might want to steer clear of this one. For everyone else, Rainbow Six Extraction is a fairly enjoyable experience.","Rainbow Six Extraction can be really entertaining in co-op rounds, but wears out noticeably over time.",,,,,"Overall Rainbow Six: Extraction is a good co-op action game and maybe currently one of the best tactical PvE shooters you can play. It's a little bit too hard on higher levels, the progression fairly grindy, especially if you play it on lower difficulty. But that doesn't ruin the fun you'll have with your friends playing together, trouble-free across all platforms, if you want.",,,,"While Rainbow Six Extraction stands out within its genre and the Tom Clancy lineup of games as a whole, it rarely does so to its advantage. This extremely tough experience becomes more frustrating if you play it alone or with random players. If someone is looking for a very involved cooperative game to play with their best friends, Rainbow Six Extraction may grab their attention, but its repetitiveness and terrible grind may get to players after a while.","More than any other studio, Ubisoft is willing to mutate its existing IPs until they scarcely resemble what they once were.","There are plenty of co-op shooters on the market, and some intriguing titles on the way (Sons of the Forest, Gotham Knights, Redfall), but Extraction has military gadgets, dank horror and heart-stopping stealth, and those are qualities that, although not original, make for a heck of a game.","Unless it’s telling me an epic story like God of War, Persona or Halo Infinite anymore I just wanna get in, have some fun and get out. Which you can do with Extraction, again with the right group of friends. Other than that, with difficulty spikes as a solo player, and the unstable randos players will be bound to run into online, I don’t see this being much more…which is a shame because Rainbow deserves better. Pray for Sam Fisher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall Rainbow Six Extraction is a very welcome change for the Rainbow Six series.

WTF SNES hockey strategy shouldn’t work in 2022. Last year I described NHL 22 as a “mildly underwhelming next-gen experience that still holds promise for the future.” Today, after nearly a month of play, I’m describing NHL 23 as a “visually appealing current-gen experience that needs to start delivering more on its promise.” Visually, it’s clear that EA Sports took past criticism to heart. While previous editions hinted at ramped-up eye candy, NHL 23 seems to make the most of current hardware, from player faces to subtle animations. For example, when taking a faceoff, real-time reflections of the overhead scoreboard are seen on the freshly-polished ice surface. As each period progresses, visible deterioration from skaters dulls the reflection until the next one starts. Details like this don’t affect gameplay, but they do allow for a sense of immersion, even from a distant overhead camera. Likewise, player faces and reactions are far more accurate and situationally appropriate, leaving lifeless expressions on last-gen consoles. The league’s current lighting and concert-like presentations are also well-implemented into each opening segment. It’s clear that EA wants NHL to be a visually arresting series in the next few years, and this year’s edition takes a big step forward by focusing on the nuances that make live hockey such an unforgettable experience. Overall, NHL 23 is a strong visual contender in the sports game arena — at least until replays, when the camera zooms in. Once up close, users will see cracks in the graphical armor, as smooth animations seen from above are revealed to be somewhat janky and stilted. It may not affect gameplay one iota, but it seems odd to see butter-smooth movements from one angle reduced to marionette performances, just from getting a slow-motion view of the action. Thankfully, the controls and gameplay speed are more realistic than ever thanks to improved physics, and an AI that demands more user accountability. Easier difficulties will still see goalies turn to swiss cheese on virtually every breakaway, but moderate-to-hard difficulties are fair, challenging, rewarding, and accurate. Disciplined hockey strategy will always beat button mashing in PvP matchups, which should appease many critics of this series, present company included. At the same time, the often-cumbersome control scheme has been made more accessible to newcomers and old souls alike. Admittedly, I’ve often reverted to the simplified NHL ’94 controls to enjoy the game at my own casual pace. For NHL 23, I never even considered it, as for the first time, using a simplified control made it feel as if I was missing out. The streamlined advanced control scheme still takes some work to master, but once it clicks with users, I don’t foresee many gamers regressing ever again. In terms of modes, NHL 23 delivers the usual deep slate of offerings, from the microtransaction-heavy Ultimate Team to the deeper and more engaging Franchise Mode. None of it is new or revolutionary. but it’s all been fine-tuned to keep the focus on the ice, and not the grind of micromanagement. Unfortunately, there are notable flaws in some of the longstanding modes and features. First, the omnipresent Be a Pro mode continues EA’s downward trend of career mode storytelling. At no point during my avatar’s hockey journey did I ever feel engaged or connected to the narrative, nor the decisions I was making. None of it seemed to matter on the ice, anyway. Maybe a deeper dive would produce a long-term storyline reward, but I felt trapped in a week-to-week deluge of minutiae, rather than feeling the excitement of a pro hockey career. Last year, I enjoyed the online “World of Chel” offerings, praising the matchmaking and overall online gameplay balance. This year, the mode took a serious step backward. While the wide variety of arcade and simulation play options is welcome, I had significant difficulty finding a stable game, and the matchmaking usually placed me with far better players than I could ever hope to beat. Over the course of several weeks, I experienced considerably more imbalance and fickle connections than in the previous edition, and before long I disconnected permanently in favor of the same, reliable offline hockey I know and love. Sadly, I think this is the key problem with the NHL series in its current form — despite all the visual sheen, extensive modes, and unparalleled control depth, this is still, at its core, the same game we’ve been playing for decades. Online and offline, even with the engine rewarding well-executed hockey strategy, most games ultimately devolve into a redundant pattern of “check/breakaway/shoot/repeat.” Even on the most stringent difficulty levels, I rarely saw the game AI slow down and run a cohesive offensive series. Instead, it shot at will, never seeking to set up an open skater. There may only be a few realistic ways to present videogame hockey in a playable form, but once the AI chose to play “run and gun” arcade hockey, I realized I was employing the same tactics I did in my college dorm room, far too many years ago. If this series is going to truly progress and make good on the updated visual presentation, more nuanced gameplay will have to become a reality, not just a promise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NHL 23 will satisfy hard-core hockey video game fans, but if you didn't like the recent NHL releases, this year's relatively small additions won't change your mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lake,"Lake is a relaxing gaming experience that is quite unique, not just mechanically, but with its laid back game design. You can tell that Gamious made Lake with a lot of heart, as it’s a charming experience that can be enjoyed in any way you see fit. While the courier parts may become dull after a while, Lake is a great example of a charming and unique gaming experience unlike anything else if you’re looking for a comforting game to unwind with.","Lake is a wonderfully chill adventure. The sense of place is great, the characters we meet are all interesting and entertaining, and I found it to be a great way to unwind after a long day – the way it should be. Well worth checking out, and an adventure I’ll come back to time again.",,,,,"Lake is a relaxing take on the daily experiences of a rural mailman. Interesting, though monotonous at times.",,,,,,,"Lake's curious proposal is surprisingly entertaining, although it ends up being repetitive. The worst part is the numerous bugs that affect the experience.",,,Buried beneath Lake's innumerable mundane tasks are some really cool characters and stories. It’s just a shame you have to dig deep to really reach them.,"Highly relaxing, sometimes too much perhaps, Lake offers an escape of a few hours that is not refused when one seeks a purely restful narrative experience. The interactive story shaped by Gamious also benefits from a great deal of authenticity and choice of dialogues that allow the player to feel truly engaged. Too bad the adventure is based on a pattern that does not evolve enough, a too languid pace and a scenario that fails to touch us fully.",,Lake is a good narrative adventure with monotonous gameplay but a fascinating artistic direction that is impossible to ignore.,,,"What Lake was for me was not a peaceful, slow-paced reflection on what matters most in life. Instead, it was an anxious and difficult exercise in letting go of things that don’t bring me joy, even if they might hold other values. And it was a reflection on queer experience and the radicalness of choosing what’s genuinely best for yourself despite others’ expectations. However, while some moments of my time playing was difficult, it was because of how I saw my own ongoing experience through Merrideth’s eyes. And if a game can make me do that through expertly crafted gameplay, a perfect soundtrack, and captivating characters and relationships alone, you can certainly color me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lake offers a relaxing, slow-paced experience that is not for everybody, but if you need a break from all the fast-paced action packed routine of these days and not looking to spend more than 20 bucks, then Lake can be a good choice for you.","In full, Lake doesn't quite reach the highs I experienced when I played it in part earlier this year. The story gets in its own way with narrative threads that compete for time and ultimately leave none of them with a satisfying conclusion. While the game is beautiful and its central mail carrier gameplay is as strangely enticing as it seemed all along, it's the people of Providence Oaks I will not miss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lake will appeal to those who like their games chilled and their pop with an alternative country twang. There’s little more to do than deliver packages, hang out with locals and admire the scenery, but when the setting is a town as beautiful and scenic as Providence Oaks, that’s more than enough. A few minor bugs aside, Lake is a great way to spend 5 or so hours. It’s even better if you simply want to unwind and go for a drive. If you do give it a chance, you’ll find that by the end of it you’ve made your mark on the town. There are certainly worse places to call home, after all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lake is a comforting game that lives and dies based on how well a player will connect with its very specific setting and vibe. It worked for me, and I hope it works for many others.",,,,,This peaceful circuit is perfect for the kind of person who tries to observe traffic laws when playing Grand Theft Auto.,,,,,,"A gentle adventure, imbued with a sense of place and purpose. [Eurogamer Recommended]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While the concept of Lake is simple and sweet, the repetitive gameplay can take away from the story and its interesting characters, making the daily delivery tasks more of a chore than something more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lake is an impressive cosy experience that condenses the best of rural life into a small package of contentment and melancholy. Fantastic voice acting, writing, and an overall positive message help elevate it past just another title available on the market. Graphical and performance issues are present, but they aren't bad enough to stop me recommending this indie adventure to anybody feeling a little lost, or searching for a peaceful and relaxing game to unwind with.",,,,,,,,,,
pac-man-world-re-pac,,PAC-MAN WORLD Re-PAC is not only a mouthful to say but it’s a great take on the game from yesteryear. PAC-MAN WORLD Re-PAC is the remastered version of PAC-MAN WORLD and it holds up great. The platforming is crisp and fun. I really like taking a beloved character like Pac-Man and changing his gameplay mechanics on their heads. You get the best of both worlds of classic Pac-man and classic platforming gameplay. Recommend!,,"For anyone looking for traditional Pac-Man, you’re better off with something like Pac-Man Museum+. However, if you are hungry for some 3D platforming, or just want to relive old times, Pac-Man World Re-Pac should be enough to keep you invested until the credits roll. Sure, it’s not up there with the likes of Mario, but it’s a part of Pac-Man’s own unique history as one of the video game industry’s leading mascots that we’re happy to welcome back with open arms.","Fans of the original will find PAC-MAN WORLD Re-PAC is like slipping on a comfy pair of slippers, and new fans will enjoy finding all the secrets and collectibles. There is a lot to enjoy in what is the greatest Pac-Man game of all time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"And hey, if it wasn’t your cup of tea in the end, at least you’ll have another way to play the original PAC-MAN, which unlocks on story completion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pac-Man Museum+ is a great collection of games from the Pac-Man franchise. There are games you are sure to have played before, titles you haven't, and great multiplayer games to check out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I like Pac-Man World: Re-Pac, and I think it's a great example that games don't need to be genre-defining to be fun, especially at its discount price. You have to go in knowing what you're expecting, and back in the days of Blockbuster Video, it's the game you might have completed over a weekend rental. In a vacuum, it's a fun, charming time. If your time or money is limited, you'd be better off with a title that offers more content.",,"Pac-Man World Re-Pac has fun boss fights and decent 3D platforming gameplay for the most part, but it suffers from excessive back-tracking and is quite short. It is a mostly faithful recreation of the PS1 Pac-Man World game, but in a much prettier package, and with its budget price, it's an easy recommendation to anyone that has nostalgia for the original. Those who never played the PS1 original may not appreciate it as much, but it's still a solid 3D platformer despite its flaws.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pac-Man World Re-PAC Edition might be worth checking out if you’re extremely curious about the game, genre, or even the time period it comes from, but there are just better games to spend your time with. If you insist then just try to get it on sale, or better yet, during its inevitable visit to Xbox Game Pass before making its way to the bargain bin.",,,,,,"Pac-Man World Re-Pac succeeds in bringing the original to a new audience with a few extra bells and whistles, however, it fails to compete against modern 3D platformers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
silt,"Although there were a few things that I think could make the game a much better experience, mostly more checkpoints for myself, the beautiful art style and surreal feeling while playing really make this a game I have no problem recommending for people to check out. It may not be a very long game but I enjoyed my time immensely. The ocean will always be mysterious, alluring and you never really know what may lie below. I hope we see more games like this in the future.","Silt takes a solid concept, uses its ideas smartly, and doesn’t out stay its welcome. A few niggles aside, this is a great way to spend a few hours solving the mysteries of the depths below and the diver seemingly stranded within it.",,,"Silt is a stunner. It’s not quite able to deliver the same type of immersion that was honed by the Playdead team and their adventure telling, but it really isn’t too far off. This is an underwater playground that is full of mystery and aside from a few little technical issues, is one that fans of visual-led stories should lap up.",,,,,,,,,"Silt is a beautiful puzzle game that, however, is not up to par when it comes to gameplay, with both frustrating and unwitty situations.",,,"All barnacles, salty sea life, and rusty, otherworldly machinery, Silt is an underwater odyssey filled with murky mystery and some pretty neat puzzles. In a nutshell, it's sort of like Limbo, but in the ocean.",,,,"Silt is a rather short, basic to control game. The story was intriguing from the start, and if you can look past how bland and unfun it is to play at times it might be worth checking out. For me though a nice art style and possibly interesting story simply isn’t enough to overcome how poor feeling and frustrating I found everything else.",,,,,,,,,,"Initially scheduled exclusively for PC, the release of Silt on console is a great opportunity to discover Spiral Circus’ beautiful first accomplishment. This game, which can be described as a puzzle/adventure game, plunges us into the oceanic abyss inspired by the dark art of Mr. Mead. Despite a very short lifespan and some rare display bugs, Silt offers a different experience from what we are used to. With its efficient gameplay mechanics and original art direction, the title manages to stand out. Silt is a treasure lost at the bottom of the sea worthy of being discovered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A charming, atmospheric indie game with some enjoyably imaginative puzzles and evocative visuals, whose only real flaw is a lack of longevity.",,,,,,,,,,,"The standout parts of Silt therefore are its artistic and sound design, creating that sense of unknowable and unsettling scale, a world that is home to weird little things and beings with too many teeth than is advisable. Respectably, the game clocks in at about six hours long, though I languished in some levels because the pieces of the puzzle of why the diver was down here were irresistible. I’ve got a theory, and what you’ll find down in the deep must be seen to be believed.",,,,,,"Things picked up with the ending, but Silt‘s bosses are in sore need of an overhaul. Thankfully, Silt has plenty of stand-out encounters to help erase the memory of those few middling ones. If you’ve the remotest interest in what lies below, this atmospheric aquatic outing is well worth diving into.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Silt is a fascinating puzzle game with a beautiful art style and poetic delivery, but the short length and unrealized potential leave Silt still needing to find itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-medium,"There’s always two sides to a story, and you only know half until you see The Medium to its conclusion. Rather than winning, The Medium is meant to be an experience, which it more than succeeds in. With a deeply immersive narrative and symbolism throughout, it never wore out its welcome with its 8-10 hour length and will be one of those games that I’ve been thinking about long after its credits rolled. The Medium truly is something unique and special.","The Medium is one of the best horror games I have played in a long time. Between the 2 worlds that have been created and the outstand sound score, Bloober Studios have absolutely smashed this out of the park. The fact that this game will be in Game Pass on day of launch is incredible and should make it a must download for anyone with a subscription.","The Medium builds upon a lot of gameplay gimmicks and ideas that aren’t always used to their full potential, but when they do work, they work incredibly well. Controlling main character Marianne as she jumps between worlds is both engrossing and exciting in practice, and the game’s main location serves its job as a setting for horror masterfully most of the time. This is a game that definitely could have been better—but which is also better than a lot of other horror games that don’t take such daring risks.","As a narrative focused experience, The Medium generally impresses. In terms of gameplay, it often just feels too easy and lacking in depth. But even with criticisms towards the latter, if you're looking to embrace a horror game for one dark night or two, The Medium is a worthy choice. It's clearly the vision of a team who loved the concept and wanted to take players on a narrative driven adventure, filled with dark themes and systems such as the dual-reality mechanic that feel integral to the story. If you can accept The Medium for the experience that it is, you're in for a good time that will continuously surprise you with its story beats and absolutely incredible visuals on the Xbox Series X.","The Medium on Xbox is the game fans have been waiting for. A dark, mature, scary, visually appetizing next-gen delight with a gripping story, it is one to not miss if you are a fan of psychological horror. Above all, this feels like an experience that really shows the chops of the Series X, and will likely serve as a benchmark title going forward, especially if the few remaining technical issues are patched.",,"The Medium is an incredible journey, a necessary game that stands as one of the exponents of the genre. A dramatic story that you won't want to miss.","The Medium is an interesting mystery narrative adventure that, unfortunately, simplifies everything it does so much that dissolves the promised horror. It is very enjoyable and we’ve had a great time with it, but it handholds the player so much that they have barely any time to think or feel fear.",,"The Medium is one of the most gorgeous horror games I've ever played. Its detailed environments, compelling characters, and unique setting make it a must-play for psychological horror fans.",,,"Bloober Team's most ambitious game convinces with a deep and intriguing story, a visually fascinating world and original gameplay mechanics merged with classical adventure tropes. It shows the polish developers' inexperience in real-time character animation and stealth mechanics, but it's overall a very good and worthy experience.","The Medium is Bloober Team's next big step. With its marvelous design and accurate portrait of History, Bloober Team surprises us with a new take on psychological horror and familiar drama. By far, its one of the darkest and most beautifully written stories you can find on Xbox.","The Medium is an interesting and enjoyable game, but one let down by some awkward animations that constantly threaten to break the immersion created by an otherwise captivating game world, and those weak stealth sections that Bloober Team can't seem to leave behind. It's very much a one-and-done game — you can easily see everything it has to offer inside of ten hours, so the pricing might be a little questionable for both the quality and quantity of what you get here. Still, price won't be an issue for Game Pass subscribers, for whom The Medium is a unique yet flawed gem that we'd absolutely recommend checking out as part of the service.",,"Layers of Fear showed early promise, Blair Witch demonstrated that Bloober could resurrect a dormant movie license to great effect, and Observer saw the studio successfully turn its hand to cyberpunk horror. The Medium is a similarly excellent game, serving as further proof of the developer's horror expertise and its credentials as an exciting creative outfit.","The Bloober Team delivers a psychological and supernatural thriller with multiple controlled influences, and a story that is both dark and touching. The Medium is an artistic work in its own right, both visual and musical, whose universe deserves to be explored. The Polish studio also manage to take advantage of this playful duality between the physical and spiritual planes without necessarily innovating too much during a linear adventure. The threat weighing on Marianne, as intense as it may be at times, loses too often in intensity to permanently mark the players. The Medium is ultimately an “arty” horrific experience like the developers' previous productions.",,,,,,,,,,"With The Medium, Bloober Team proves once again that their imagery for the conception of horror stories has no limits. The Polish studio enters into the new generation of consoles through the front door with a split-screen ghost story that fans of the genre will love. Its simple gameplay makes it accessible to everyone, and that makes the game even better.",,"The Medium is an absolutely chilling romp, and considering it’s an Xbox Game Pass Day One title, there’s literally no reason not to give it a go if you’re a member of the service. While the story could be a lot simpler, this is definitely a horror experience I won’t be forgetting anytime soon. I’ve been waiting a long time for Bloober to finally nail down true horror, and The Medium is a wonderful example of how to do scary without relying on cheap tricks. If you’re a fan of Silent Hill, Clock Tower, Haunting Ground or even if you just want to test out the capabilities of the latest Xbox consoles, The Medium is a must-play.",,"As a whole package The Medium is very much a story of compromise. For all its successes in visual storytelling and interesting setting, it’s collared by poor pacing and dated game design. Still, it’s well worth a look for history buffs and those fascinated by the unknown. So what lies beyond? It’s still up for debate. In the present, The Medium offers an intriguing possibility to puzzle on.",,,"The Medium is an enjoyable survival horror that's held back by a lacklustre narrative and a signature mechanic that never reaches its full potential…Even with Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka's score ringing across its twisted soviet world, Bloober Team's latest project pales in comparison to the legends that came before it.",,"If you’re after action and full-on horror, The Medium will likely leave you wanting, and considerably so. This is more of a slow burn, the twisted plot unravelling over six to eight hours. I found the pacing to be ideal, with the game throwing just enough moments of high intensity into the mix to keep things interesting. There is a big bad of sorts, but don’t expect traditional boss fights, with encounters being designed to be intimidating and scary rather than difficult. Bloober clearly wanted everyone to be able to see this story through to its conclusion.","The Medium may not be a flawless 9th generation experience, but it's a great alternative for those who miss the Silent Hill series, thanks to its great story and wonderful music.","The Medium is less survival-horror and more adventure-horror like the studio's past games, but so long as Bloober Team is still refining this style, the team is clearly getting better. Characters and story are stronger here than in anything this team has done yet, and the world is rich in detail and atmosphere, made all the better with a moody soundtrack.",,"The Medium boasts an engaging narrative plus clever gaming dynamics and while it starts slow, the ending builds to an impressive crescendo of unexpected surprises. So if you like to be surprised, don’t keep reading the reviews or watching Youtube videos because this is one game that must be experienced without coming in with any prior knowledge as you twist your way through of both the land of the living and… the dead!",,"Because of its macabre nature, The Medium won’t be for everyone — and certainly isn’t a killer Xbox app — but it’s definitely worth a try if you’re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber.","The Medium is a decent horror game that has some really good ideas, but ultimately fails to live up to its potential.",,"The Medium never hits a flat note. I beat the game in two long sittings, and there was never a point during either that I felt like the game dragged, or could’ve used a little more polish, or left too many loose ends hanging. It’s a lean, compelling experience that says what it has to say, then leaves you to grapple with the specifics afterwards. There are images, lines, and ideas from The Medium that I’ll likely take to my grave thanks to this approach, as it puts the onus on the player to piece everything together. You have to wrap your brain around the spirit world’s twisted logic so much that it becomes a part of you, as you live through Marianne’s pain with her and help to navigate her trauma. Much like Marianne’s past, don’t expect The Medium to leave your head any time soon.",,"Brilliantly paced and palpably tense, The Medium is a psychological horror adventure that’s all thriller and no filler.",,"The Medium won't give you any sleepless nights, but treat it as a paranormal thriller rather than an all-out horror game and you'll find an interesting story (albeit a disturbing one at times) that will encourage you to push through its slightly repetitive split-screen gimmick to find out how it all ends. A short but intriguing tale.","The Medium is without a doubt Bloober Team's biggest game to date, and it is easily one of its best. The story is captivating as are its characters, and the uneasy journey you take through it feels much like if Stranger Things was set in the Alan Wake universe.",,"Medium is definitely the most ambitious project of Bloober Team, albeit it cannot completely avoid the moniker of an “AA” production. The visuals of both the real and metaphysical worlds are of high quality, the story keeps the interest high and the music is the glue that holds firmly together the whole experience. If only it tried to offer more depth in its overly simplistic environmental puzzles and gameplay in general.","Don't expect a horror game but a paranormal adventure, one that will intrigue and surprise you with some of its mechanics. A noteworthy and attractive experience that, maybe because of that, feels a little too short.","More than an allegoric hodgepodge, but not by much. The Medium offers an interesting, layered mystery with a lot of beauty, character and atmosphere, but fails to be wholly entertaining. The gameplay is often too simple to be fun, due to some rather tedious trial & error sections and a lot of scouring the environment for an object that will most likely send you to the next search. You’ll probably need more patience for this than the end feeling is worth.","The Medium is uninspired, from puzzles to characters. If you’re looking for an interesting world to explore, it delivers with stunning art direction, but for those looking for a richer experience, The Medium feels skin deep.","The Medium is a step in the right direction for Bloober Team and I hope that it’s a sign that the studio is moving out of its comfort zone. It’s definitely the most dynamic title from the devs so far. At its best times, The Medium channels Silent Hill, but the rough pacing and limited gameplay outside of puzzle-solving hold it back. Additionally, the unsatisfactory ending leaves a sour note that detracts from the overall experience.","The Medium is a fascinating horror with a great unexpressed potential that falls short in being an experience that never feels truly ambitious: on the contrary it proves to be kind of limited, withheld and not exactly deep.",,,,,"The Medium is, without a doubt, Bloober Team's most ambitious game in terms of scope and scale. It successfully leverages fixed camera angles and strong sound design to inspire a horror experience that's unashamedly nostalgic. Despite its successes, it never really capitalises on its unique dual reality mechanic and ultimately feels the same as the team's previous games.","The Medium's story may be the best I've ever experienced in a horror game, the way everything is tangled and interrelated is impressive not to mention the mind provoking puzzles and the immersiveness of the world.","The Medium is an artistically inspired and technically interesting horror game, almost entirely based on narrative. With a slow pace and a few really interesting puzzles, the game focuses on the evil atmosphere of the double world. Those who expected a broader adventure may be disappointed.","The Medium is a pretty fun horror game, but it lacks must of the values of series like Silent Hill.",,,"This is more of an evolutionary vestige than a healthy new growth. Bloober might have done better to let it die. [Issue#356, p.92]","The Medium has grand ambitions, but stumbles under the weight of them all. The story is emotionally engaging, but the environments fail to leave a memorable impact. Puzzles are repetitive and typically solve themselves, while slowly moving through the hotel loses its threatening aura. The Medium is a great story to watch and listen to, just not to play.",,,"The entanglement of two realities is an interesting concept. But The Medium shows too many design weaknesses, can become tedious and doesn’t live up to the expectations you might have in an intense horror game.",,,"Instead of high-tech thrills and survival horror chills, this disappointingly mundane thriller struggles to impress with a muddled narrative and unengaging gameplay,","The exclusive Microsoft - The Medium is yet another significant milestone in the catalogue of psychological horror games from Bloober Team, which is increasingly becoming one of the best studios in this area. Without hiding where it comes from, it's an experience horror fans won't want to miss, no matter how short. The duality approach is interesting and has enormous potential. I hope that the Bloober Team will get to work on it again and develop it more in-depth.","The Medium will not be the best psychological horror game in the world, but it engages like few others. Bloober Team once again raises a bar that dropped somewhat after Blair Witch and presents us at times two games in one, with quite effective mechanics despite its simplicity. A great gift for Xbox Game Pass subscribers who will enjoy it from day one.",,"Yes, this is one of the first Xbox Series X’s big exclusives, yes, it’s in the Game Pass. But those are about the only reasons why you should even think about playing this mediocre horror.",,"The Medium is Bloober's most ambitious game, with good history and puzzles, although also with some poor mechanics.","The Medium is a short game that does not offer much in terms of replay value. Normally this would be a serious problem, but The Medium is available through Xbox Game Pass, and so its short length isn't nearly as pressing of an issue. It's short but mostly sweet, and will definitely appeal to fans of classic survival-horror games. It's easily Bloober Team's best game yet and something Xbox Series X owners should check out as soon as they can.",,The Medium will scratch the horror itch for some for a while but fails to live up to its potential in a number of significant ways.,"For a title devoid of action, outside of a couple of stealth sequences and a ‘run towards the screen from the giant monster bit’, The Medium might commune with the spirit world... but it fails to communicate all that well with the player.","Buried underneath the messy narrative and the mundane gameplay, there's a good game in here, somewhere. But for the most part, The Medium is a game that I'm very happy to put behind me and never think about again. For any fans of horror, I would firmly recommend you give this game a miss.","Ambitious, mesmerizing and scary, The Medium's parallel worlds provide a brilliant atmosphere without reaching the full potential of their promises. Its lack of gameplay is balanced by an impressive narration, nonetheless.","The Medium is a very good horror narrative game, despites somes riddles that may be too simple, and the dual reality mechanics may not be as original as expected.",,"The Medium is well-worth checking out for fans of old-school survival horror, and it's coming to Game Pass on day one, but despite being entertaining, it will inevitably leave players wanting more from a promising but ultimately uneven experience.","The dual-reality mechanic goes just about far enough to keep its slowest gameplay moments interesting, and paired with a fantastic narrative and exceptionally eerie atmosphere, it's an easy recommendation for fans of Bloober Team's work in the past and the horror genre in general.","The Medium isn't a bad game by any stretch of the imagination – it's just nothing special. The dual world mechanic doesn't offer much that's genuinely new or interesting, the next-gen visuals are let down by poor animation, and the controls are a bit clunky. It's also simply not scary. The saving grace is that the world that's been created here is interesting, allowing for a story that keeps you wondering what the next revelation will be throughout its eight-or-so hour running time. Still, there's good groundwork here if Bloober Team does ever deliver a sequel – hopefully with better facial animation, more grotesque enemies roaming its environments, and an actual combat system.","Eventually The Medium's narrative threads begin to weave together, even connecting to the original goal of discovering Marianne's origins. The promise that everything somehow connects in some unforeseen and fascinating way is a thrilling reason to see the game all the way through. The connections to real-world events of Polish history make many of the revelations even more poignant--even if the supernatural aspects are fictional, it's deeply unsettling to think about how some of the evil present in this game did actually occur. And to that end, The Medium's conclusion sticks with you; it's one last horrifying reminder that trauma may not define a person, but it can have consequences we can't even begin to foresee if it's not adequately dealt with and simply left to fester over time. I can't say I enjoyed the ending to The Medium, but I am deeply satisfied with how it sets up the inescapable nature of its horrifying conclusion.","With creepy puzzle moments throughout, The Medium pulls off a dual-reality puzzler with precision. The game looks magnificent, with impressive lighting and shadows courtesy of RTX, though the Xbox Series X version suffers from occasional stutters and hitches, as well as level of detail pops. More classic dread than jump scares, it delivers on its promise of horror served two ways, making it unique and a must-have for horror fans, even if it's a little lighter fare.","If it is not quite the great game that we could have hoped for, The Medium is nonetheless an endearing adventure, which can be enjoyed with pleasure. Finally, despite some very real efforts (RTX and HDR in particular), the technical aspect is more of an AA budget than AAA.","In short, The Medium is a good game with a well-told scenario, tortured and complex characters and its dual reality system is original: the whole is very cinematographic and the relationship to death is well treated. However the gameplay, although charming, is dated which makes that pleasure is a bit wasted. Finally, even if we have a good time, Bloober Team's game is not memorable once finished.",,"The Medium certainly has a story worth telling, but the stop-and-go nature of the vehicle for the narrative may prevent some from fully exploring it. The Xbox Game Pass release seems like a smart route for the game because of that, and while I’m normally hesitant to experience games in this way, I feel like I would have enjoyed The Medium much more if I’d watched someone else play it.","The Medium scores particularly well with its story and gripping atmosphere, but does not reach that class in terms of gameplay.","In an era where everyone wants a new Silent Hill, The Medium is launched. This game by Bloober Team goes out of its comfort zone and shows us on a silver platter what the storage speed of the Xbox Series X | S can offer. Sure, it's not a perfect game, even the number of puzzles is questionable, however, the narrative is fresh, the use of split screen as a mechanic is something technologically remarkable, and the overall experience delivers when it comes to scaring and entertaining the audience.","The Medium relies mainly on the intense atmosphere. The detailed environments are amazing. But The Medium is also just too short, too easy and a bit too predictable to be named the new Silent Hill. Moreover, we can expect more from a ""real"" next-gen game.",,,,,"The Medium, perhaps aptly, is an interesting game of “nearly there”. It is creepy but not frightening, intriguing but not wholly engaging, clever without capitalising on it. This translates to its story, which I never lost interest in but neither was I completely hooked. The Medium goes to some dark places, touching on a slew of heavy ideas like mourning, PTSD and child abuse. It doesn’t drop the ball on these, per se, but neither does it feel equipped or committed enough to do them justice.",,The Medium is a chilling tone piece that's bogged down by retro influence and a protagonist that can't stop oversharing.,"Bloober Team has summoned a rich atmosphere, under all that writing, and one or two sequences offer glimpses of a purer game.","The Medium is hugely ambitious and could have been a site for incredible, innovative storytelling. Instead, it fumbles sensitive topics, plot points evaporate into thin air, and characters who are studied closely are left behind and never mentioned again. Even while taking notes, the story became difficult to follow. It took me 12 hours over three nights to play, and towards the finale I was astounded by how a game so short could feel so long. This certainly is a game of two worlds: one very beautiful and one very empty, unfortunately leaving us with a game that is all skin and no spirit.","The Medium is a strong outing for the team at Bloober. It is easily my favorite game they have released to date. The eerie soundtrack and locales set the mood nicely. The story is interesting, and I loved the duality in the puzzle-solving.",,,,,"The Medium is the studio's most successful, accessible offering yet, and a sign that Bloober continues to improve, mature, and innovate. I cannot wait for its next terrifying adventure. [Eurogamer Recommended]","Sadly, I never felt like the game truly took advantage of its two-reality system. There’s no big final level that tests all your spirit world knowledge and skills. And that might be because outside of a few instances where you use your spirit self to shoot some energy or burn some moths, there’s not much else to do in the game. You walk around, you pick up stuff, you read some notes and in a few small instances, you get some cutscenes through the eyes of someone else. This simplicity, coupled with a lack of combat, one enemy who is fairly easy to avoid and areas that look good but are filled with the same puzzles over and over made me lose interest.",,"The Medium lasts around 10 hours, which is just the right length for the story to wrap up nicely. It even ends on an Inception-style cliffhanger, where what actually happens is fairly ambiguous. (I can’t wait to have people to talk about it with.) But in terms of gameplay ideas, it does end rather abruptly: just as the game starts finding really interesting ways to play with the dual-world structure, it’s over. The last few hours are far and away the most interesting, and I wish the rest of the game was as inventive. The multiworld premise isn’t quite a game-changer, but it adds just enough to make this psychological thriller worth checking out.",,,"Despite clunky animations, repetitive gameplay and some technical issues with the Xbox Series X version, I completed The Medium twice. Its dual-reality design, art direction and brilliant soundtrack often made me stop to take in a view or relish the music. Its mature story and atmosphere reminiscent of Silent Hill helped a lot too. [03/2021, p.40]",,,,,,,"Some random good points I noted were the music, which worked nicely to add to the atmosphere. Great voice-acting and writing, excellent graphics, so an all-in-all solid presentation that deserves a hat tip. Great checkpointing, a nice mixture of puzzles and exploration, and a good pace overall as well that compels you to play this game to completion in just a couple or few sessions. In sum, The Medium is a great game with a few quirks, and it’s the best from Bloober Team to date. Available on Game Pass, it’s well-worth playing through as it makes for a nice early next-gen experience.",,"A psychological thriller with an impressively ambitious gimmick and some old-school leanings, The Medium crafts a gripping narrative with loads of atmosphere in an experience that’s unmissable for genre fans, even if frustrating design occasionally undermines the tension.",,"There is a lot to be pleasantly surprised by The Medium. What Bloober Team has accomplished as a relatively small developer is remarkable, but there’s a drawback to the game. One that makes playing the game a next to schizophrenic experience.","Despite its technical prowess and stunning visuals, The Medium is a drag. From slow, uninteresting gameplay to a confusing and poorly executed story, Bloober Team's latest makes for a good tech demo, but not much else.",,,"The Medium is Bloober Team’s most ambitious game to date, and while certain aspects work better than others, the result is a decent horror romp that even the most horror-averse can enjoy.",,,,,,,,,"While The Medium’s design stumbles are disappointing, its human characters and gorgeous world are ultimately the things that stuck with me. Once I finally made it to the end of the road, I immediately restarted the campaign to experience all of the narrative breadcrumbs with the newfound clarity of the ending in mind, which is the sign of an effective story. And the game’s day one availability on Xbox Game Pass is just another in a long line of reasons why the service is a must-have. It might not reach the unforgettable highs of James Sutherland’s time in the town of Silent Hill, but The Medium carves out its own corner of the genre that’s worth losing a bit of sleep over.","Much like Bloober Team’s previous horror efforts, The Medium features an interesting story in a compelling and creepy world but is let down by often boring and dragged-out gameplay sequences.",,,,"There’s certainly technical wizardry at work making the game’s big hook possible, and the realm of the dead is a well-imagined bit of dark artistry, but we’ve also seen smarter and more compelling iterations of the same idea in recent years.",,,,"The Medium provides the best classic survival horror experience through modern gameplay systems that I have played in quite some time. It does this all without relying on action and gore but instead builds its excellence through atmosphere, environments, and narrative. There's some refinement that could help the overall experience, but this is a gripping adventure whether you're in reality or the spiritual plane.","The Medium didn’t manage to become a spiritual successor to Silent Hill, but it’s still a significant step forward for Bloober Team. [Issue#252, p.50]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The real strength of The Medium is the novel way it uses split-screen gameplay to tell a single-player story. Numerous video games have used split-screens for multiplayer in the past, but The Medium is the first one I know of which extensively uses the technique for a single-player tale.",,,,,"The beauty is both bright and dark, delivering not only one atmosphere to appreciate but two. While the story can be a bit confusing and hard to follow, it still manages to at least put an idea in your head that you can work with. There are a few areas that seem to go on a bit too long but maybe that’s just because I played it twice. The lack of extras and chapter select is especially unfortunate because of there being so many collectibles. It’s a very unique game that has excellent voice acting and terrific music and sound effects. Only a few times did I see stuttering and sometimes there were weird light issues. The things I think need improvement happen to have a very big impact for me when it comes to an overall package. Otherwise, everything else was really well done.","Marianne might be able to jump between two realities, but The Medium is trapped somewhere between being a worthy Silent Hill successor and another mediocre hide and seek horror game.",,,
sable,,"Sable is one of the latest games to get a day one release on Xbox’s Game Pass service so it’s almost impossible to not give it a recommendation for anyone with a subscription, but on the whole, I was somewhat let down. The game has some of the most visually stunning graphics I’ve seen, but the gameplay gets repetitive. Exploring the desolate expanse on your own terms is not as fun as it sounds; however, a compelling series of quests and wonderful writing throughout are just enough to keep you hooked and justify the price of admission if you’re already a Game Pass subscriber.",,,"A few rough edges do not stop Sable from being a one-of-a-kind adventure about finding yourself while alone in the big wide world. I hope Sable can fix its technical issues soon, because what’s underneath is a game full of discovery, tiny nuggets of wisdom and a plethora of ways to customise your insanely cool hover bike.",,,,,"With its striking art direction, haunting soundtrack and focus on exploration, Sable is a great journey about understanding yourself. Frequent stuttering and some bugs bring the experience down though.",,,,"Sable is a beautiful game, with an astonishing soundtrack and artistic vision, that show us the journey of self-discovery of our young protagonist through an exotic planet, full of sand, mountains and spaceships.","It breaks my heart to criticise Sable so. The first few hours are truly remarkable, packed with moments of beauty, creativity, and childlike wonder, but the more you play, the more the mask slips. Despite the technical issues, it's testament to the abilities of the small team that it has been able to create a world so inventive and interesting, if one whose sparseness starts to work against it once the initial sightseeing tour is over. It's a crying shame, though, that those who want to see everything that this captivating setting has to offer — whether through inherent completionism, chasing achievements, or simply being drawn in by the lush playground itself — are those who will suffer Sable at its worst, even if the highs should still prove strong enough to carry you through the lows in the end.",,"A thoroughly enjoyable and relaxing voyage of soul-searching self-discovery, Sable is also a rewarding jaunt across an otherworldly desert that involves climbing, hoverbiking, and gliding. And rather good it is, too.","A visual tribute to Mœbius, Sable seduces first of all with its captivating features and colors. He is also granted an exploration rich in great freedom and some gripping mysteries. But the sawtooth technique is terribly lacking on the trip. And the universe lacks a certain consistency, struggling to engage us completely during its long stroll.",,,,,,"Sable clearly has its share of flaws, but it makes a pretty good argument for style mattering more than substance.","Sable does so much well that it’s a shame that these issues consistently distract from its stunning world. This is the sort of game that may be easy to recommend in a few months after a few patches, but I can only rate the game as it is. There’s still a lot to like here if you’re willing to put up with some frustration along the way. Just know that if you purchase it now, you’ll be dealing with a less than smooth ride.",,,,,,,,,,,,"There's a melancholia to Sable, wrapped up in the ruined cities and gigantic skeletons dotting its landscapes, but this is balanced with an infectious core of positivity running through the game. What it lacks in drama, it more than makes up for with sheer creativity and grandeur, leaving you with a sense of serenity much-needed and appreciated in these bizarre times. However, it all circles back to the joy of discovery: you might not know exactly what you’ll find as you peel back the layers of Midden, but it’s bound to be interesting.",,,,,,,,,,,"Sable’s unique art style, memorable characters and quests, and engaging open-ended formula are going to stick with me for a long time. But the numerous technical issues, wonky camera, and bland puzzles all make this otherwise compelling odyssey a lot rockier. Those issues can be frustratingly frequent distractions, but when they did manage to fade into the background I found myself mesmerized by Sable’s bizarre world of creepy worms, masked weirdos, and hoverbikes.",,,,,,"Sable it's a wonderful adventure that, at first sight, can seem slow and with frustrating aspects (slow pace, world apparently empty...), but its universe will hook you up with lots of mysteries to unfold and the main character's journey. All that with an unique audiovisual and aesthetics that will leave you wanting more, even with evident faults.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A stunning visual style can’t hide the fact that Sable is not only uninterested in guiding its players but it doesn’t really care about entertaining them either.,,,,,,,,,,,"Perhaps it's the writing, or those aforementioned best moments, or more likely some potent combination of factors, but Sable is special. I can feel it, still, hours after putting the pad down; the sensation of riding a geyser to a mountain peak, the crack of the crystal pillar under my avatar's feet. That golden sunrise breathing warmth back into this world. At the risk of repeating myself, it absolutely deserves to be played - just maybe not right now, and not quite like this.",,"Despite its gorgeous graphics and a superb soundtrack Sable still featureS too many collision bugs to deliver the oniric adventure it is supposed to. Only those who will excuse its many technical flow will enjoy a true chillful and arty open world, with many surprises and enigmatic nomads to meet all the way.",,,,,,,,,,,"In Sable, all parts intertwine in a perfect manner. Alone the technical deficiencies currently impair the experience.",,,,,,,,"Sable, with its sci-fi desert, reflective soundtrack and reverent respect for architecture, could so easily have valued aesthetic over impact. But the actual feel of the game experience itself is the oasis in the middle of a desert of incredible ideas and inspiring design choices. Sable concocts a warm world full of delight and character at its edges, and leaves the gaps in between intentionally blank for you to fill with your own stories – and it’s quite unlike anything else you’ll play this year.",,"It offers an otherworldly break from the busyness of life, and, when you do return to Earth, you will do so with a smooth landing, and without stress.",,,,"Sable lacks the same level of polish as Breath of the Wild or other AAA open-world titles. But as an indie game made by a small team, Sable is an unforgettable adventure that can elicit a deeply personal connection to the player.",,,,,,"Most video games are about “beating” them, giving you an objective to satisfy or a quest to complete. Sable doesn’t need you to complete it. That might be why the game’s best moments don’t happen along some questline but are experienced only through dogged exploration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-chant,,"The Chant offers a thrilling foray into the survival horror genre. The acting and crafting elements make Jess’ plight feel incredibly dire, while the story remains gripping throughout. Despite some technical limitations, this grim island teeming with tension is still an eerie paradise worth exploring – especially when confronted by the mysterious Gloom!",,,"The Chant has some really interesting new game mechanics, and a structure and story which are both very original. However, there is a sense that the narrative is rushed through and the horror feels low budget rather than something stranger.",,,,,,,,"The Chant is a fun horror adventure with its own personality, but it fails to reach 100% of its potential due to a too predictable script and a technical compartment plagued by several shortcomings.","The Chant gives off old school survival horror aroma. It doesn't stand out graphically or offer revolutionary gameplay, but it has all the necessary elements to dazzle horror lovers.",,,"A strange horror experience that isn't all that scary, The Chant is nonetheless an interesting ride while it lasts, despite being marred by a scrappy story and even scrappier combat. It's weird, but not all that wonderful.",,,,,,,,,,"The Chant offers a mix of horror you don't see often in games. It combines survival-horror with elements that could come straight out of a H.P. Lovecraft book. Besides a few flaws the game looks great and the gameplay keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way. The gameplay could use a bit more depth, especially the combat and the skill tree and sometimes you miss a bit of balance. Still, if you start this game, be ready for a ride that keeps the blood pressure going up and down.",,,,"The Canadian studio Brass Token can be proud of its first game. Indeed, despite some visual shortcomings, the Chant is rather pleasant to play and is as good as some so-called AAA titles. As long as one finds the various clues on the island, a well-crafted story unfolds before our very eyes. The game mechanics are good, the graphics decent and the combat phases well-paced. Additionally, the truly immersive soundtrack allows us to plunge wholly in a rather scary universe. The stiffness of our character and the life span of the title are the only real downsides. All in all, we indeed had a good time with Jess and the Prismic Science Spiritual Retreat.","The Chant has an intriguing premise and setting that set it apart from its cousins in the horror/action adventure sphere. While it doesn’t break any new ground with its mechanics or combat, and it’s definitely not very scary, its exploration of psychological states adds a bit of specific narrative color. Budgetary limitations in character models, lack of refinement, weak combat, and inelegant animations aside, The Chant is just unique enough to make it appealing to fans of the genre.",,,,,,,"The Chant is by no means a great game, and there are plenty of sketchy aspects. Combat is iffy and clumsy, and there are a lot of fetch quests. Just the same, The Chant is mostly enjoyable thanks to a solid story and lush environments.",,,,"Despite some teething problems, The Chant is certainly worth a playthrough for those who appreciate the survival horror genre. More importantly, this debut title has me excited for what’s next from Brass Token.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Chant brings a few interesting ideas into the modern Survival-Horror-Genre, but stumbles as much as it succeeds. The setting and story have their moments, but a lot of the characters feel too two-dimensional and predictable. Combat has some depth, especially with the introduction of roleplay elements, but ultimately the lack of diversity turns combat to a chore outside of a few especially well-made bossfights. Nonetheless, The Chant is a game well worth checking out for fans of the spooky and supernatural and deserves more attention than it currently got.",,,,,,,"Aside from a few issues and a single voice actor, I had a great time with The Chant. It has a good atmosphere, simple mechanics and a fun overall story that kept me going for the six to seven hours it took. This is going to be one of those games that will be looked at in a few years as a hidden gem that people didn’t play. Let me at least be one of the people to tell you, play this one. You’ll have a pretty fun time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Chant is a surprising and impressive experience. It runs tight and brief; rarely wasting time but allowing enough breathing room for the player to explore at their own pace. It looks amazing, has excellent acting and a compelling narrative that explores some unconventional topics for a horror game. It is too bad it rarely is scary and is too easy. Making Jess a terrible fighter would probably be a worse design choice, but The Chant really needs to have more threatening foes and redesign them to be scarier. Fighting a massive toad that has a shark-like head feels more like something out of an off-brand Resident Evil than a 70s-inspired horror game with a new-age mysticism bent to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nickelodeon-all-star-brawl,,Nostalgia fills the air in Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl now that it is out on Xbox. On one hand this is the closest the Xbox will see to Super Smash Bros. and on the other hand it’s full of classic Nickelodeon cartoons and I love a good crossover. This will no doubt be a fun time with friends or kids alike as long as you know that the base content can be had very quickly and thus the repeatability could become a bore. If you are in it for the long time this is a fine brawler to pick up.,,"There's also just not enough content to sink your teeth into. Outside of arcade, multiplayer and a sports mode, where players must score a goal in the opponent's goal, there's just not much to do. Unlocks aren't particularly exciting either, offering little more than concept art and other goodies. It's all a bit of a shame, as there's honestly some solid mechanics buried beneath the issues. If developers Ludosity and Fair Play Labs can stick with the game post-launch and build it up, it could end up being a completely different story in a year or so, but as it stands, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl feels like the shell of what it could be.","The AI bots are dumb, but it’s really in the local play and online where the game shines. It’s fast, fun and furious, with a pace that makes the older gamer wince, but when it all comes together, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is more than capable of delivering a decent old time.",,Brawl it out as your favorite Nickelodeon characters in bombastic platform battles! With a power-packed cast of heroes from the Nickelodeon Channel.,,,"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is brimming with fantastic characters, fun combat, and legitimate potential. However, limited content and a laundry list of bugs keep it from thriving as a platform fighter right now.",,,,"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is a platform fighting game that offers fun and good times with friends. Evaluated from this perspective, the game delivers, and if that's what you're looking for, you won't regret it. However, this game could have been much better, especially in details, fluidity and content. If you are able to look past its disappointing visuals, or its unoriginal soundtrack, this game might have something interesting to give you.",,,,"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is riddled with flaws. Not very pretty, not always very precise, a little sparse in content, the dubbing of the original cartoons are absent ... However, the fighting game of Fair Play Labs exudes passion. We don't recommend it to everyone, as NASB is targeting a very specific niche. By mimicking the physics of Super Smash Bros. Melee and implementing one of its advanced techniques, this atypical brawler manages to seduce those nostalgic for the early 2000s. Those will see it as a good way to immerse themselves in the licenses of their childhood while by rediscovering familiar sensations and a solid competitive environment. Hopefully the studio's follow-up will be good, as Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is holding something.",,,,,"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is a fun fighting game with iconic characters and easy to learn but challenging to master mechanics. They nailed the feel of a good fighting game, but the game still feels like it has a ways to go before it reaches the level of an iconic franchise like Smash. The potential is absolutely there, and after we see a few DLC launches who knows where it will stand, but for now it’s hard to imagine myself inviting friends over to play All-Star Brawl when Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is still around.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Probably the most fun you can have in a Nickelodeon videogame, this is a derivative but fun fighter that kids will enjoy, but will probably do quite well in the competitive community too.",,,,,,,,"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl tries to be a challenger for Super Smash Bros. and aims for the weak spot of his opponent, showing off a stable and solid netcode. A good multiplayer and tight controls, though, are not enough to reach the stars. The roster is good and varied, but a little scarce right now (maybe DLCs will fill the gap) and characters lack characterization (no pun intended): a pity, because Nickelodeon’s original voices and music would have added a lot of value to the game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl contains the beginnings of what may end up being the most unlikely competitive fighting franchise ever conceived. It knows its audience and it has been able to appease them, garnering a lot of excitement along the way. However, where Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl missteps is in the handling of its properties. It's easy to get excited about the thought of Reptar dash-dancing across Jellyfish Fields, but it's tough to buy into the idea when there's a rogue ukulele serenading the mute dinosaur while it happens.",,,,"A game with a boat load of Nostalgia and good bones. A fighter that’s fun with friends, challenging with AI, and competitive online. With time and love, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl could be a top tier fighter in the near future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then Beyond Light will suit you just fine! However, if you're expecting some substantial changes from Bungie by now and aren't exactly excited to get back into the grind, you might want to focus on the next-gen version and wait for Destiny 2 to release its December update.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wait to see how the next-gen upgrade of Destiny 2 shakes out; if you're either on the fence about returning, or jumping in for the first time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Destiny 2 is a game about thriving inside the space between new discoveries and big moments. It asks you to patrol the same stretch of post-apocalyptic ramble, defeat the same swarm of strange aliens, and collect the same guns over and over again until you’re tired and fed up, and then asks you to log on the next day and undertake this long, familiar hike toward spiritual exhaustion all over again. And we do. I can’t speak to the reason why millions of others return but for me it’s always been the game’s bold and prolific art direction, super-satisfying kinetics, and granular, romantic world building that’s kept me coming back. Beyond Light nails each of those one again, which is why I haven’t stopped playing it since its release.",,,,,"Jupiter’s icy moon of Europa failed to make a good first impression on me, but the longer I played, the more I enjoyed the new map. I do not miss Mars or Mercury anymore. Returning players may not be happy about Bungie getting rid of some content and making a substantial part of old gear obsolete, but I understand the need to do some cleaning up before evolving the game. At its core Destiny 2 remains the same thing you loved (or hated) and its shooting mechanics are still among the best you can experience.

madden-nfl-22,,"Madden 22 is the next year’s instalment on the franchise and I feel it’s gone back a step. Yes, it looks graphically better, but otherwise it’s really not that much different to previous instalments. The career mode is a roll-forward from previous years, as are the achievements. EA could do so much more with the Madden franchise and it’s a shame they haven’t executed it as well as I’d hope.",,,"Almost every change in Madden NFL 22 this year is of a positive nature, and it is easily one of the best entries in recent years. Franchise mode is in great shape, and set to get better as the year progresses, and it almost feels like EA Sports are reminding themselves that not everyone wants to just play Ultimate Team. Some modes such as The Yard and Superstar KO still feel tacked on but at least offer a bite-size gameplay experience if time is limited.",,With new features and additions to existing game modes Madden 22 can be a wonderful touchdown for the IP veterans.,,"Madden 22 is a clear step up over last year’s entry in the long-running series. Improvements to Franchise mode, gameplay enhancements that feel authentic, and a taut, competitive game of football all make this a year worth re-joining the roster for – assuming that they can get on top of the technical hang-ups.","Madden NFL 22 injects some much needed improvements into a series that was dangerously close to growing stale. Coupled with some big changes to core modes, Madden NFL 22 elevates itself into one of the best from the long-running series.",,,"Madden 22 looks like a sort of transition edition: it winks at the next-gen but doesn't fully exploit its potential, adds interesting new features but doesn't fully rectify some old flaws. The gameplay is still very good, but we are partially disappointed by the lack of the quality leap we were expecting.","Madden NFL 22 takes a step forward, but it still has a long way to go. Although it is varied and full of modes, the game does not seem very interested in attracting non-American audiences.",,,,"If we have to compare Madden NFL 22 to one of the two quarterbacks on its cover, the latter is more Tom Brady than Patrick Mahomes: he becomes thinner and more complete over time, but still idles like his last years. The game is running out of steam from a technical point of view, and the difference between the next-gen and the PS4 / ONE versions is not so obvious on the visual, especially as the online and solo bugs are still also common. On the other hand, Madden does not fall into the trap that made Opus 21 a failure, namely to give a second youth to Franchise and Career modes via cool additions (Momentums, coaching staff talent tree ... ). For the rest, we will wait for the real ""slap"" episode that the new generation of consoles deserves in the years to come.",,,,,,"If you haven’t picked up Madden in a few years, there’s nothing glaringly wrong with this year’s release and I would recommend it. On the other side of the coin, if you’re a diehard and you play every year and might even have the free next gen release from last season, I’d say this year is a safe skip and just download this season’s roster.",,,,,,,,"It’s clear more time with next-gen hardware has paid off. Madden NFL 22 looks and feels like a step back in the right direction for the series.

Face of the Franchise, to put it mildly, is a mess. Homefield advantage is a solid addition, but it doesn’t quite capture the true extent of real on-field momentum swings. The new interface is an eyesore, and the new presentation is cast in a strange and unflattering shade of sickly green. It’s smoother and marginally more refined, but in so many ways it’s the same old Madden. In short, if you’re hoping for a massive leap forward for the series on the new generation of consoles (or on the old ones), you’re apt to be disappointed.",,,"Madden receives a kicking each year regardless of what changes EA and Tiburon make. But it seems the developer listened a bit to the voices of dissent as what I am feeling here is a much crisper and user-friendly game than the buggy mess of last year.

But there is always next year.",,,,,,,"For those who have not played Madden NFL for a few years, the new episode may be the right opportunity to start over. The Franchise mode has been rearranged and the direction taken seems to be the right one, while the gameplay, waiting for the adjustments in the secondary, is appreciated for a renewed physics in the inertia of the players' movements and for an AI that in more than one opportunity surprised us positively. The magic of the new generation has been little seen for now: Madden NFL 22 is still a good game to watch even if it was legitimate to expect something more. In general, our advice is to wait for EA Tiburon to fix bugs and glitches: time is up and the season has just started.",,"Despite its several technical issues, the on-the-field action of Madden NFL 22 continues to improve in small ways.

Whether you’re sucking up a load of the titular gunk to help bring an alien world back to life, or listening to an engaging back and forth between the game’s main characters, there’s plenty to like here, even if it doesn’t quite live up to its early potential.","More seductive in its first part, The Gunk offers a pleasant exploration in sumptuous settings which lose their luster a little over the course of the journey; it also fails to renew itself in the challenges and puzzles it houses. This short adventure of 6 to 7 hours only is appreciated in the tranquility of its experience, its narrative potential and its beautiful dubbing. But difficult to be fully excited after spending long hours sucking up to abundant parasites.","What I experienced was a fun but short and undercooked title. It needed much more depth and a greater range of difficulty. None of the aliens will test you and this undermines the difficulty. I wish the developers had worked on the resource management and upgrade system some more. If this had been explored, the gameplay would be exponentially better. All things considered, I enjoyed it, but I wanted much more.","The Gunk is a fun and engaging indie title with a simple and addicting gameplay. The environmental puzzles are many and always different, well implemented within the experience.",,,"While not perfect, The Gunk is a fun game that carries a great and important message. We need to save our environment. A compelling story, relaxing yet sometimes boring gameplay, and stunning visuals.",,"Ultimately, it’s hard to give The Gunk a strong recommendation. It’s a very old-fashioned game, one that feels like it wouldn’t have truly stood out even in the era it feels like it belongs to. Despite likable characters, the story doesn’t really satisfy either. The core mechanics just plain work, though, and its short length doesn’t overstay its welcome. While it feels like the development team squandered the potential for more, those who can check it out without a significant investment will find a few fun hours. Perfect for Game Pass, indeed.",,,,,,,"The Gunk is a competent product, but it feels very risk-adverse and derivative. You’ve seen and played elements of this game before. It can be fun for a while, but you soon realize that The Gunk has a limited vocabulary and spends too much of its time amicably repeating itself. Instead of being the foundation for something grander, The Gunk is satisfied to make its exploration and simple mechanics the entire game. As a Game Pass product, however, it’s not hard to cautiously recommend The Gunk as a pleasant enough diversion.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Image and Form swaps 2D for 3D, but still delivers an excellently crafted game with a captivating story and heartfelt characters.",,,,,,,"The Gunk has a fantastic setting and lovely characters, but ultimately the gameplay is lacking.",,,"We enjoyed exploration, puzzles and platforming in The Gunk. Image & Form Games delivers an interesting adventure set in a beautiful planet, which feels undeveloped in other aspects such as combat or equipment improvements.","The Gunk is a game that you will probably soon forget. The journey of discovery is linear and the things you discover are never really exciting. The facial animations and cliché gameplay make the game feel like a PlayStation 2 remaster, the low difficulty takes all the tension away and the story has little to do with it. It is a nice entry-level game for people who have less gaming experience.",,,"The Gunk would have deserved a little more structure and background vision: perhaps a better elaborated and refined gameplay, a dose of extra variety and last but not least a more incisive writing - because beyond the wonderful lyricism of the column sonorous it is complicated to become seriously passionate about the events narrated. Too bad, because with a different attention the outcome of this extraterrestrial outing would have proved much more memorable.","The Gunk is game full of charm, thanks especially to its wonderful art direction and the colorful alien world it created. Unfortunately, despite its short duration The Gunk does not manage to carry this sense of wonder all the way to the end, due to repetitiveness of environments and a gameplay that ends up being far too simplistic. It’s still a valid title, especially for younger players; it just needed a little more to truly shine.","The Gunk deserves a fair bit of criticism and only a little unreserved praise. The connection between the characters holds up the story, sucking up goo is strangely satisfying, and the mechanics work as intended. However, I wish the world felt more distinctive and better realized. The environment has the potential to be a vibrant kaleidoscope with brilliant hues and unearthly forms. Unfortunately, it doesn’t quite hit that mark. All said, The Gunk is a competent romp through space, but not a stellar one.",,"Not exactly the kind of game we were expecting from this team. While relaxing and inspired at times, too many aspects of The Gunk are quite mediocre, or too simplistic to really allow the game to shine.",,,,,"The Gunk is a little hidden gem that, despite not feeling innovative or deep, is able to entertain and move the player.",,"In just a fraction of the time it would take another game, The Gunk manages to instil the full sense of exploring an unknown planet to its core.

It doesn’t get too bogged down in any major flaws, but it doesn’t do much to surprise either, sticking to adventuring basics, and a small toolset of abilities. That said, there is some good characterization here, and whether it ties into the SteamWorld universe or takes its own branch, it would be great to see Rani and Becks back for a more grand adventure.",,,,,,"Too familiar, too easy, and too short but if you’re looking for an undemanding time waster on Game Pass you can certainly do worse than The Gunk.",,,,"The creators of the Steamworld universe stepped out of their comfort zone for the first time - and it’s a solid step indeed. The Gunk is visually stunning and its central mechanism, vacuuming the titular substance off the ground, is really well done.

However, it presents certain mismatches in its control and its main mechanics, in addition to a conservative technological level.","The Gunk has its flaws, but it's still a mostly enjoyable way to spend a few hours. It's a short but sweet adventure with gameplay reminiscent of PS2-era platforming games and so fans of the genre should certainly give it a look through Xbox Game Pass.",,,"What we get when all’s said and performed in step with The Gunk’s level design, is a fleeting experience really only good for the Achievements (your first G is a whopping 50, and this rarely lets up), or for a chilled and relaxed romp through an alien world whose FernGulley storyline is face-slappingly on-the-nose. I mean, it’s actually quite fun, despite Rani’s overly contextual Mepsipax design, which is entirely at odds with everything I’ve gunked at you here, but it did suck me in.",,,,,,,"Short as it may be, my time with The Gunk has been wonderful. Image & Form’s move into the 3D realm has solidified it as a truly talented developer – and this may just be its best game yet. Beautiful, satisfying and engaging from start to finish, The Gunk is definitely worth getting stuck into.",,,"The Gunk is a very good independent title that offers graphics that have nothing to envy to big AAA productions. It's a shame though that the game only lasts 5 hours, that the gameplay doesn't evolve much and that it lacks epic moments. Fortunately, it's released on Xbox Game Pass and that fixes a lot of issues.",,,,,,The Gunk has to rely mainly on its beautiful game world and nicely written dialogues. Those are unfortunately just not good enough to compensate for the faltering story and lack of challenging battles or puzzles.,"There is nothing fundamentally wrong with The Gunk. It works from a technical standpoint and it isn’t the worst way you can spend about five hours of your time. But I just can’t muster up any sort of authentic excitement about it. If it were funnier or cleverer or more challenging, I could maybe start to see it as a title I could recommend. But as it is, the best I can do is pay it that slightly backhanded compliment of saying it’s perfect for Game Pass.",,,,,"The Gunk is a nice game you could spend a couple of evenings with and then move on. It’s lacking challenge and is pretty short, but the characters and overall feeling of exploring an alien planet make it still worth your time. If nothing else, it’s an interesting experience that is hard to pigeonhole into any one genre.",,,,,,,,,"As the journey shifts and becomes a bit darker, there's a real flash of steel at the core of it all. If you've played the SteamWorld games, you'd probably expect this, but it's still a delight to see a game like this built with such craft and obvious humanity. I started The Gunk worrying about how one of the great 2D design teams would cope with three dimensions. The truth is they cope so effortlessly that I just spent the next four or five hours gloriously lost in what they had built.

From the puzzle solving of various Tomb Raider titles to the Uncharted vibe of the lush backdrops and the Luigi-style hoovering up, none of it individually has been done better than the many times before. But as a package, this is a nicely put-together game and a great little addition to the Game Pass’s ever-growing library.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For all the neat freaks out there, this one’s for you.",,,,,,,,,
the-callisto-protocol,,"Thinking back on the game as a whole, though there’s obviously that Dead Space DNA running through it – from the over the shoulder camera, the stomping on corpses for items, the diegetic UI and more – this feels like the successor we probably should have received instead of Dead Space 3. The action is here but it still managed to keep the survival horror flavour and tone intact. It’s not perfect, but it’s a solid outing for Striking Distance and one we hope they can build on in the future.","The Callisto Protocol feels like a throwback title, for better and worse. While the Dead Space comparisons are unavoidable, director Glen Schofield’s return to survival horror does bring with it several new concepts, but many, like the melee combat system, suffer from poor execution. Still, if you’re looking for a fun, B-movie disaster story with some famous Hollywood faces and a more straightforward, linear single-player experience, you could do worse—at least until the Dead Space remake launches next year.","The Callisto Protocol really is a game of two halves. Striking Distance Studios has served up a slice of sci-fi/horror that gets off to a reasonably strong start, introducing a jaw-dropping world and punchy new combat system that impresses until it becomes strained by busy enemy encounters, a handful of miserable boss confrontations and a narrative that goes absolutely nowhere. As much as this one dazzles from a graphical perspective, overall it's a shadow of the game that it most closely seeks to emulate. With little in the way of replayability and a final act we genuinely never want to sit through again, we'll be returning to the USG Ishimura for our action horror kicks long before we set down on Callisto again.","Fans of the original Dead Space may find The Callisto Protocol lacking in comparison. The story is inferior, combat isn’t quite on the money and the enemy variation is lacking. That said, there is still a good sci-fi survival horror game hiding within.",,"The Callisto Protocol is the true successor to Dead Space. All the good things about the first title can be found in it, but enhanced with state-of-the-art graphics and a cinematic sense that makes it spectacular from beginning to end.","The Callisto Protocol is like a game from the PS3/360 era. No open world, no RPG elements, and no other self-imposed AAA features that plague the industry these days. It’s a flawed game, but most important, it’s fun and intense, and we wish there were more games like it.",,"Striking Distance Studios' debut title is a horror game that delivers a high-quality experience all the way through. It won't sway anyone new to scares and frights, but fans of the genre should make this a priority.",,,"The Callisto Protocol is a raw and brutal sci-fi survival horror with extremely physical, challenging, and visceral combat and a first-rate graphical compartment. Even if it feels inadequate from a narrative point of view and its linear structure smacks of somewhat dated game design, the overall result is still convincing and it manages to keep interest high until the end. Definitely recommended if you love survival horror and claustrophobic sci-fi settings.","The Callisto Protocol plays it safe. It sustains its playable base on the pillars that made Dead Space an icon of space terror and that is fantastic news for fans of Visceral Games' work. Perhaps some imagination, innovation or narrative unpredictability is missing, but the new work from Glen Schofield is exactly what Dead Space fans could expect. Its raw and violent gameplay is addictive and the beauty of its settings is astonishing. Unfortunately, the title is weighed down by a very poor technical section that fails in performance, in sound and even in such a basic aspect as the correct placement of checkpoints. Despite everything, space terror fans and especially Dead Space fans will find exactly what they came looking for. And that's okay.",,,"An unflinchingly violent and gruesome survival horror that ratchets up the tension from the get-go and doesn't let up, The Callisto Protocol is superlative stuff, and a must for anyone with even a passing fancy for Dead Space and its ilk.","In space, no one will hear you scream... with joy or anger? Building on the rock-solid foundation of the first Dead Space, The Callisto Protocol dodges the photocopy with its intense, difficult, but not as precise melee combat as we would have liked. Despite a certain lack of audacity, Striking Distance managed to steal Saturn's rings in order to slip them on the ring fingers of sci-fi horror lovers. Fasten your asteroid belt, the Space Mountain gore will shake you up, even if the trip turns out to be as imperfect as it is classic.","The Callisto Protocol is an exceptional horror adventure title. It will be hard for Dead Space fans to ignore the similarities, but it should be enjoyed on its merits. With slick combat, amazing aesthetics, and an incredible plot, this needs to be played.",,"The Callisto Protocol is a gorgeous mess. I cannot recommend it at the full launch price. The combat is miserable, and the story is simply not interesting. If you are a massive fan of survival horror it lets you down by not being scary either, instead relying on jump scares the entire time. It is highly competent technically though, and I hope the team at Striking Distance gets more time for their next title, which very well could be a sequel to this one.",,"The Callisto Protocol is my biggest disappointment this year. While it nails the aesthetic and is one of the most beautiful games I’ve played this year, it misses the mark in almost every other department. I think it can be refined to at least be more fun, but in its current state, the story and gameplay weigh down this new entry to the survival horror genre from the potential it so obviously has.",,,,,,,,"As fans of the survival horror genre, we were eagerly waiting for The Callisto Protocol: and what a ride. Glen Schofield and his new team of industry veterans master their art and offer us a very successful horrific experience with an exemplary artistic direction and production. The nervous and tactical confrontations are exhilarating to play and the discomfort can be felt throughout our undertaking. Fans of gore will be served. Despite all the studio’s efforts to diversify the game sequences, the title suffers from a dated level design linked to the cross-gen development. Spiritual son of the legendary Dead Space, The Callisto Protocol, if not having killed its father, can at least look him straight in the eyes with dignity. Thanks to a lore that looks promising, it has also earned the right to chart its own course. We are ready for the next one!",,,"There’s a solid game at the heart of Black Iron Prison, but every opportunity the game gets to subvert expectations or do something new is instead a moment of deferral to one of Callisto’s many inspirations. It’s nice to see Callisto try to be a new brew, synthesised from many parts, but an entirely new vision would have stuck around in the bloodstream a little longer.",,,"This isn’t to say there isn’t a good game oozing within the sticky flesh of this Frankenstein, though; it just feels like it’s not what Striking Distance wanted it to be. It’s not the next step in horror gaming, the evolution of Dead Space, or a proposition unlike anything you’ve seen before – it’s the opposite. An amalgam, less than the sum of its parts, whose main focus becomes overwrought and frustrating by the time you’re halfway through its short run-time. The scariest thing about The Callisto Protocol, sadly, is all the potential that’s been wasted on a small moon in Jupiter’s orbit.",,"Visually, The Callisto Protocol is one of the only games for the PS5 and Xbox Series X that feels like a next-generation game. But that ambition has clearly come at a cost. For all its bells and whistles, The Callisto Protocol isn't doing much of anything new with its story or design. It's not just a Dead Space imitator, but it does manage to take a lot of the ideas from earlier action horror games and execute them half as well. Alongside myriad factors and the fact that New Game Plus and Hardcore modes — staple features of the genre — aren't coming until next year is evidence that The Callisto Protocol should have been given more time to have a smoother, fully-featured launch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As a great fan of horror games, who sees one of the best moments in Dead Space, I do not hide that I ended my experience with The Callisto Protocol with a bad taste in my mouth. I found myself faced with a graphically remarkable game, with an honest albeit banal story and with a gameplay that works until you are confronted with the basic mechanics. On all of this, however, some conceptual and game-design problems have arisen. From an unrefined and substantially outdated user experience, to a disastrous Italian audio track, passing through the lack of a terrifying element, the cornerstone promise of The Callisto Protocol. In my memory will remain a game that I played from start to the end without serious technical or structural problems, but which will probably soon fade in my memory because it lacks a strong personality, a desire to stand out and the fundamental element for its genre: adrenaline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Callisto Protocol has the qualities to have been a great survival horror, but we found too many execution problems that end up dragging down the experience.","Considering its short length and current lack of replay value, it is somewhat difficult to recommend The Callisto Protocol at full price, but it is a must-buy when the price comes down a bit. The Callisto Protocol is an excellent game let down by some hugely important missing features, but hopefully future updates will help it live up to its full potential as a worthy successor to the Dead Space franchise.",,,"From the outset, and playing on Xbox Series X, The Callisto Protocol is a genuinely jaw-dropping visual assault. It might have the most detailed interiors of any game I’ve ever played, and the variety in art that accompanies these is staggering. From the initial prison sequences through to deep underground spaces where you’ll be navigating an old, abandoned colony to the surface of Callisto itself, the game serves up a terrifying feast for the eyes.",,,,,,,,"Overall, individual elements of The Callisto Protocol are just at odds with one another too often. The enemy design and melee-focused combat mechanics lend themselves to these incredibly tense and fun close-quarters brawls when you're only fighting against a couple of targets at a time, but the game regularly locks you into frantic moshpits or frustratingly difficult boss fights instead. And despite the vocal talent and mocap skill on display, The Callisto Protocol's story isn't all that interesting, save for an intriguing final twist. Some genuine horror might have improved the experience of this survival-action game, but The Callisto Protocol instead leans too far into absurd high-octane spectacle, dampening the tension and adulterating the narrative core of the experience.",,,,,"The Callisto Protocol isn't necessarily bad, but it doesn't do much to verify why survival-horror fans wanted these types of games back in the first place. With a bit more depth to its various systems and mechanics, The Callisto Protocol could have been far more enjoyable from start to finish. Instead, my main takeaway from Callisto has simply been that I'm now that much more excited to play a number of other survival-horror games that are set to release in 2023.",,,,,,"What The Callisto Protocol lacks in truly original ideas it more makes up for in presentation and atmosphere. A game this polished and confident from a newly formed studio that had to work through a pandemic is nothing short of impressive. While it won’t change anyone‘s mind who didn’t like the spiritual predecessor Dead Space, this brings back unsettling space horror at its peak.",,,,"Despite some cumbersome combat systems and performance issues, The Callisto Protocol successfully builds on Dead Space's legacy.",,,"This game wants to be Dead Space really, REALLY, bad, but what’s interesting about that is I haven’t even finished the first Dead Space game and I can see it. Is this a bad thing? No, it’s really not as Callisto Protocol isn’t a trash game at all, they tried some new things with the controls and stuff some of it worked but for me a lot more of it didn’t. The game’s depiction of excessive violence is fun but even it wears on to the point of feeling overboard, especially when you think why they have giant grinding machines in the open like this in the middle of a prison. The story, while predictable, was an enjoyable adventure, but as far as graphics this game looks incredible. But as most of us know by now, looks aren’t everything and so it is with Callisto Protocol.",,,,,,,,"I wanted to give up many times throughout the game, but I powered through because of how much I dug the beginning of the game. But eventually a multi-stage boss fight broke me and I had to stop. This is what makes The Callisto Protocol so disappointing. It does so much well, and a huge percentage of the game is a blast. It’s the kind of high-end horror experience that doesn’t really exist outside of Resident Evil. But then it sours things with difficulty that adds absolutely nothing to the experience. In the end, the scariest thing is the wasted potential.",,,,,,,"It's a shame that, despite looking great and having a good concept at its core, some poorly-executed ideas lead to a frustrating experience overall. For a new studio to produce a brand new IP is obviously a mammoth task and commendable, so here’s hoping the team get another chance to get a grip on this universe and tighten up the experience.",,,,,,"Overall, Callisto is a really good survival horror experience. If you like Dead Space, you need to try this game. The main campaign has a lot of passion put into it and I had a bunch of fun with it. The game definitely has some problems here and there, but I think true horror fans will admire it for its fantastic campaign. I really feel that this series will have just as interesting of a world as Dead Space if the series continues beyond this first installment. The story is overall good and the ending begs for DLC or a sequel. Be sure to try this game if you’re in the mood for a cinematic horror experience with a lot of intensity.",,"A bland sad protagonist with all the charisma of a rock with a frowny face, a mystery box-style narrative that only ends with more mystery boxes, a combat system that wants to be multiple entirely different games. The Callisto Protocol might function, and it’ll certainly have its launch issues patched out in due time, but in no way can I recommend it to anyone but the most morbidly curious. Everything was stacked in this game’s favor, and it still wasn’t enough. We didn’t need Dead Space 2.0 - we just needed a cohesive, focused game. Instead, it's an oddly soulless concoction of unfocused ambitions, poor planning, and inconceivably amateurish design. Whether you're winning or losing, Callisto Protocol never feels right.",,,,,,,,"The Callisto Protocol is a deeply immersive sci-fi horror experience that firmly grabs you at the start and doesn’t let go. While this immersion shows its cracks during the transition into new areas, it’s not enough to ruin the overall experience. The Callisto Protocol is an impressive first outing for Striking Distance Studios, and the latest entry in the pantheon of excellent sci-fi horror stories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Callisto Protocol is an engaging action horror, focusing on close combat and a powerful, oppressive atmosphere.

aliens-fireteam-elite,"If it wasn’t for the franchise backdrop, Aliens: Fireteam Elite would be just a basic horde shooter that becomes tiresome and repetitive unless you really want to grind to max out each of the characters and weapons. For a game that focuses on multiplayer, a mountain full of more effort could have went into quality of life improvements to make it a seamless shooter to gather friends online and shoot some Xeno’s. Game over man, GAME OVER.",,,"Aliens: Fireteam Elite mostly delivers the goods with a super solid squad-based shooter set in the Aliens universe. There's plenty to enjoy here, lots of fun nods to the movies, tons of lore, impressive attention to environmental detail and slick Xeno-slaying action that's enhanced immensely by taking the fight to the alien hordes with a couple of friends. It may be a little repetitive, there aren't nearly enough surprises and the campaign fizzles out towards its end but, grab some buddies, get your headsets on and crank up the difficulty and there's hours of properly intense, team-based action to get stuck into with this one.","Aliens: Fireteam Elite is very good indeed. There are issues, but the presentation is bang on, the action is unrelenting, and with missions taking 25 minutes and upwards to complete, the campaign is a good one. Throw in five classes to go at and this should well keep you busy. That’s not to mention the horde mode that unlocks when you complete the campaign.","Aliens: Fireteam Elite reminds us of the mostly forgotten genre of movie tie-ins (even though this is simply a franchise tie-in occasion). It’s one of those games that mostly tries to capitalize on the power of its title, but at the same time it’s highly derivative in almost all of its aspects.",Aliens: Fireteam Elite is a our chance to blast away swarms of xenomorphs at will in good co-op fashion.,,,Aliens: Fireteam Elite does the franchise justice by delivering an addictive co-op shooter set in iconic locations from the films.,,"Like the films that inspired it, Aliens: Fireteam Elite is great popcorn fun with a friend or two, but if you’re not a fan of the popular film franchise and/or siege-style game modes like Gears of War’s Horde and Halo’s Firefight, you are likely in for a long grind, especially if you are playing solo.",,Aliens: Fireteam Elite is the cooperative game that every fan of the franchise will want to play. The setting and the confrontation against the Aliens make it a very enjoyable experience for fans of Ridley Scott's work.,"Overall, I really enjoyed my time with Aliens: Fireteam Elite and aside from a handful of bugs, the game shows promise of a solid third-person co-op survival game. The rich lore and stunning level design put it on par with other successful Alien titles in terms of presentation (if not in terms of being faithful to the source material with its hordes of papier-mâché Xenomorphs), and although there isn’t anything revolutionary about the gameplay, the experience itself feels well crafted. I hope to see some of the issues resolved in the near future, but can happily say that this isn’t just another game to toss on the Aliens failure heap.",,"While not bad enough to be nuked from orbit, Aliens: Fireteam Elite regrettably falls short of what I'd hoped for from the franchise, especially seven years on from Alien: Isolation, which remains the high watermark. A lack of atmosphere, tension, and interesting stuff to do beyond shooting things, makes for a somewhat disappointingly flat experience.",,,,,,,"So while I’m not quite ready to slap a score on this just yet, I will say I’ve had a lot of fun with Aliens: Fireteam Elite, and I’m hoping the online experience holds up really well at launch. As a fan of the films, I’d like to see this one do well, and it’d be neat to see what the developers could potentially introduce in future updates considering the foundation of the game is so solid at this point.",,,,,,,,"Apart from a camera that despises the view from a corner, some buggy and inconsistent team matchmaking mechanics, and the curious decision to add punishing roguelike elements, Aliens: Fireteam Elite is a polished and potentially fun and action-filled romp through a corner of the Alien universe and lore. Played without human squadmates and reliant on AI stand-ins at anything but the easiest difficulty, the game’s more repetitious aspects begin to grate, as failure will be inevitable. Played with a trio of living beings possessing some situational awareness, reflexes and the ability to communicate, using an arsenal of cool guns and toys against swarms of iconic Xenomorphs is a mindless, if not mind-blowing, good time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aliens: Fireteam Elite is a solid third-person co-op shooter that feels like it belongs in the franchise, but its replayability has yet to be determined.",,,,,,,,,,,"Aliens Fireteam Elite is a cooperative shooter without infamy and without praise that, at a budget price, allows you to spend a few hours immersed in the typical atmosphere of Xenomorph-based films in the company of a couple of friends. However, do not expect a product capable of entertaining you for a long time due to an underlying repetitiveness and a scarce variety of situations that tends to tire rather quickly, not to mention the presence of an AI ally that is far from perfect, which makes the title difficult to enjoy for those who want to live the experience alone. The hope is that the free add-ons promised by the team can somehow revitalize the product and perhaps do justice to the Challenge Card system.",,"Aliens: Fireteam Elite occasionally fires on all cylinders, but a monotonous gameplay loop bogs down the entire experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite what its reduced price might suggest, there's a lot here to keep you entertained for numerous hours, especially once you've managed your first run through all four acts and start tackling them again with higher difficulty settings in the pursuit of consistently better gear. There's so much satisfaction in customizing and managing a handful of classes with enough depth to transform them into the Colonial Marine you need at a given time, along with a plethora of great weapons to make the moment-to-moment action engaging from the first time you pull the trigger.

This continues to show that EA Sports has found a groove for itself when it comes to updating the yearly sports title, and with some new changes to gameplay, Madden NFL 23 feels even more like a brand-new title than it has in perhaps a long time.",,"Madden NFL 23 is the best entry in the franchise in the past 10 years, but with such a low bar to clear and EA effectively having no competition, it can feel too similar to prior games to warrant the hefty $69.99 price tag.","With the introduction of FieldSENSE, Madden NFL 23 represents a turning point for the series, on next-generation consoles. A few technical smears still remain, and we hope they will be promptly fixed, but the homage to the great John Madden and the innovations in gameplay make it definitely recommended to all fans of this sport.","Madden NFL 23 is a great tribute to John Madden and a game that manages to take the franchise much further than its predecessors. The changes in the animations make it more realistic in all aspects and especially in what matters most, the collisions. And the new skill-based passing system manages to give more control. I think this is a pretty decent installment of the franchise, for fans and for those just starting out in the NFL world. Although the Face of the Franchise mode could have been revamped more.",,,,"Madden NFL 23 is as usual greedy in number of game modes, faithful to the level of modeling and the show offered, but is still slowed down on certain points. The American football simulation is still not translated, decided this year to offer a career mode without a scenario, and is unfortunately not spared from certain visual bugs. EA Tiburon will still be able to rely on the small changes made to its gameplay with Fieldsense technology for the next games, full of potential.",,,"On the field has seen a marked improvement over last year. The overall presentation is great, but the microtransaction heavy focus still detracts from things for those interested in the FUT mode. Being tied to the online servers for so much of the game’s functionality is worrisome when the servers have been in such rough shape during this launch period. Also, the game is $70 on series consoles which is a big ask for a yearly title. Overall it’s a step in the right direction that I hope carries the franchise back to its once great heights.",,,"Regardless of me being an old man yelling at the sky about the licensed presentation (or lack thereof), Madden NFL 23 is a win for console and PC. Now like I mentioned earlier, my PC use case is extremely particular, but I assume many players are now in a similar situation. Sports games on handheld have never been a great experience and Madden 23 is the first to really wow me, which is more of an example of how great the Steam Deck is, but I can’t hold that against Madden. As far as the current gen console release, Fieldsense is truly a game changer and made me think more about ball placement than I ever have in a football game. Dropping an over the should pass from Russell Wilson to Jerry Jeudy just feels extra satisfying, especially when it’s over Chiefs defensive backs. PC or Console, either way you’re a winner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Madden fans will tell you that it hasn’t been a great decade for EA’s football sim. Like the NFL itself, the profits have continued to grow, but the product has suffered. Madden NFL 23, though, provides a glimpse of a light at the end of the tunnel with a handful of smart enhancements to animations, AI, and passing mechanics that make subtle but meaningful improvements to the moment-to-moment football on the field. To be clear, Madden still has a long way to go to catch up with other sports sims, the majority of which are more refined, less buggy, and have a clearer identity. After playing Madden NFL 23, though, I finally have a little optimism that it’s on the right path — maybe not an emphatic “Boom!”, but clear forward progress for a series that so desperately needs it.",,,,,,,,,,"After two years to forget, Madden NFL seems to have embarked on the road to redemption, with a playable homage to the great John Madden. The new additions to the gameplay and the advances made by the AI, give the series a new dimension, as well as the Franchise mode that has finally been fixed. There are several areas to fix, however, and our feeling is that EA Tiburon has not yet managed to really exploit the power of the next-gen.",,,,,"Stripping away the flash with a bigger focus on the core basics, Madden NFL 23 feels like a breath of fresh air. It’s still a series lacking an identity right now, but this year’s entry is the course correction the series has desperately needed.",,,"Madden NFL 23 has good fundamentals and fun gameplay, but the game-as-a-service elements and micropayments end up affecting the final product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This year's Madden is a lot like the past decade of Madden in that it suffers a number of self-inflicted wounds and returns features that were unpopular in years prior. However, it's crucial to reiterate, on the field, Madden genuinely feels great for the first time in a long time. The changes to Franchise are helpful but not revolutionary, the MUT Field Pass system is promising but janky at launch, and other modes are largely forgettable. This would all present quite a lackluster view of the game if not for the impressive on-field leap it performs. The improvements on gameday make Madden 23 a flawed game, but clearly an improvement in the series' most important way: the actual playing of football.","Building off the momentum of Madden 22; Madden NFL 23 brings fresh looks to both Franchise Mode and Face of the Franchise while keeping the train rolling with The Yard and MUT. While there are still some buggy moments, Madden NFL 23 is worth picking up especially for those who haven’t played an installment in the series for a while.",,,,,,,,,,,"Madden NFL 23 certainly isn’t lacking content and is arguably more realistic than ever. Yet, after nearly a decade of treading the same still waters, it’s never been more evident that a new approach is needed. As much as I appreciate the gameplay improvements and still enjoy the annual Madden experience, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to recommend investing money into it year after year.","It feels that EA Tiburon have a conundrum here as there is both too much and not enough when it comes to Madden’s modes. Persevering with stuff like The Yard and Face of the Franchise to keep the options broad is all very well, but when no aspect of the game is given full attention, everything feels undercooked.",,"Madden NFL 23 is an improved game when compared to Madden NFL 22, but that isn't enough to make it good.",,,"While this year’s Madden will always feel somewhat bittersweet due to John’s passing, I think that it was beyond perfect that the best version of Madden football would be the one that was made to honor the legacy of its namesake. From the factoids that I learned about Coach, to the superb presentation and soundtrack throughout the entire game, to the fantastic on field play; this years Madden as far as I am concerned has finally broken free of the 2K series and has gone all the way!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Madden NFL 23 is not the MVP, but it is a departure from the terrible games of recent years and perhaps this is the future of the franchise; if so, welcome to the promised land Touchdown!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bright-memory-infinite,"If you're a fan of fast-paced first person shooters, Bright Memory: Infinite is definitely a game for you. There is a distinct smooth combination of ancient Chinese mythology style combined with futuristic technology. While quite a short game, able to be completed in a single sitting, it was entertaining from start to finish.","All in all, Bright Memory Infinite might not quite live up to the hype it built up two years ago, but it’s still a solidly made and presented shooter. The action is fast and hectic, and the sword and glove powers are great fun to use and upgrade. A few niggles aside, you should consider checking this out if you’re after a bit of fun but brainless shooting.",,"What's here in Bright Memory Infinite is impressive, and the shooting feels super smooth throughout. However, even though the first Bright Memory was classed as a demo-of-sorts, Infinite still feels like an Xbox Series X|S tech demo, all things considered. It's still incredibly short at just two hours long, and the game's story, systems and world need more work for it to feel like a full game. We dig what's here, no doubt, but we were hoping Bright Memory Infinite would feel more like a full game than it ultimately does.","There is a lot to like in Bright Memory: Infinite. It is a graphically impressive marvel that is a marked improvement over its predecessor. The story is hard to follow but the gameplay more than makes up for its shortcomings. From the solid gunplay to the fun genre mashups, Bright Memory: Infinite is undeniably a fun time.",,"Short but intense, Bright Memory Infinite is a next-gen shooter with good ideas and concepts, but doesn’t know how to take advantage of it.",,,,,,"Bright Memory: Infinite is an interesting production primarily thanks to its combat system, which successfully mixes firearms, melee attacks and the use of powers, aided by an undoubtedly powerful visuals, albeit in a linear and static world. The rambling and quickly forgettable story and the extreme brevity of the experience, though, don't make it easily recommendable to everyone.","Bright Memory: Infinite is not a particularly good game in any way. It has some technical problems, an empty story, and is quite short. But it offers a satisfying mix of fast-paced shooting and dynamic action. The result is not entirely satisfactory, because of its limited approach.","Bright Memory: Infinite is a promising new entry from a small studio, with visuals and a gameplay loop that give it the opportunity to sit alongside some of the heavy hitters in the genre. While it's lacking in a few elements that could carry it through to greatness, it's also dripping with potential and could be the start of a successful franchise if FYQD-Studio polishes some of the game's foibles. All-in-all, it's a short romp through action-focused levels that's sure to offer any FPS fan a burst of fun and have them feeling like a killing machine in the process.",,"A slender and streamlined FPS made by just one person, Bright Memory: Infinite is quite the feat – an action game that flies by at a lick, bombarding you with slick set-pieces and cracking gunplay. This is a first-person shooter distilled to its raw elemental components, and it's marvellous.",,"I was a little sceptical, to begin with. However, I’m glad this didn’t put me off. Because of its real-life locations, a large array of enemies, and interesting combat mechanics, it’s an enjoyable title to play. Bright Memory: Infinite is only held back by its short game time, but don’t let this put you off. If you are in the market for a slick and stylish futuristic shooter, then look no further.","Bright Memory: Infinite is a fast-paced game supported by various and well-built mechanics, but which pays off for being really too short. That’s why the various sections end up running out too quickly, leaving the player with the feeling of having played a simple prologue of a more substantial adventure.","It feels pretty good, looks great, and as long as the price isn’t too bad it’s worth checking out.",,,,,,,,,,"If you are looking for a game comparable to a John Woo movie, Bright Memory: Infinite hits the bullseye! Bullets everywhere, a high-paced rhythm and graphically speaking, it is phenomenal. It must be said that the game is really short with a lifespan of barely three hours on the normal difficulty, though. Fortunately, during this short period, one tends to feel like a godlike figure when switching between the multiple combinations of Lumi-Blade/abilities/weapons and this could almost brush under the rug the few glitches encountered during our sessions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bright Memory: Infinite offers gameplay that successfully mixes gunfire and hand-to-hand combat, without sacrificing anything on the technical side and the fluidity of the clashes. The main campaign is perhaps too short but the low cost of the game and the fact that it was made by one person, make it an experience not to be underestimated. The hope for the future is that Zeng Xiancheng will be able to form a well-fed and talented team, which can support him to make an even more ambitious, complete and satisfying video game. The bases from which to start are all there and this does nothing but load us with expectations for the future of the creative.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bright Memory: Infinite is a shooter that accepts what it is. It feels great, the shooting is sublime, and it is impressive considering the development team behind it. There is a lot here to love and it feels like a shooter from the golden era of the genre. I had a ton of fun and with a low price point entry this is a game that screams to be played. Don’t sleep on this game, it is fast, fun, and truly a technical marvel. Don’t sleep on Shelia’s adventure, just maybe stick to the default outfits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bright Memory: Infinite is a shallow action piece consisting of great gunplay with awesome graphics, but every other aspect of this game is heavily underdeveloped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
assassins-creed-valhalla-the-siege-of-paris,,,,,"I am a huge Assassin’s Creed fan and loved the Valhalla base game. Yet the first Wrath of the Druids expansion failed to blow me away. It’s a similar case here with The Siege of Paris. It’s good, but really nowhere near what we have come to expect from the franchise as a whole.",,,,,,,,,Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Siege of Paris is a good DLC that keeps expanding Eivor's story. The infiltration missions return to make it clear that they should be a must for the future of the series.,,,,"If it is a little shorter than its predecessor, this second Assassin's Creed Valhalla DLC is nevertheless more interesting. This is due in particular to the gripping atmosphere of this afflicted Francia, governed by a king who has lost his mind. With its striking atmosphere and striking characters, this historical extension offers us a more complex experience than it seems. Add to that a little welcome return to basics and the qualities of the initial title, and you get a new gripping adventure for Eivor, although hampered by the absence of a seat worthy of the name and real novelties.",,,,,"If you’re a fan of the base game, then Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Siege of Paris is more of what you’re already excited about. But it’s a weaker DLC than “Wrath of the Druids,” to be sure, despite higher levels of marketing hype.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The DLC's Infiltration Missions will surely appeal to fans of classic Assassin's Creed games, but by and large, Valhalla's second DLC feels like more of the same. It's a solid expansion, but far from essential.",,,,"Even with the satisfying creative freedom of its Infiltrations and the brisk bite that scythes add to combat, The Siege of Paris doesn’t feel like an essential addition to Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. Its story provides a truly memorable menace in King Charles, but otherwise doesn’t stand out much from what we’ve already seen, substituting Breton soldiers with Frankish ones. Valhalla of course remains fun on its own merits, but the base adventure already has Mjolonir’s weight in nearly identical content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Siege of Paris, the new DLC for Assassin's Creed Valhalla, is a nice expansion, which just leaves you wanting more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
serial-cleaners,"When I first started playing Serial Cleaners I was very frustrated because I didn't see any way not to get captured, so I put it down for a couple of days. Once I went went back to it, I have since changed my tune. Serial Cleaners is very bloody and gruesome and at times annoying. Still, once you figure out that you need to learn the patrols and see what kinds of things you can do to distract the officers, this opens up a fantastic opportunity to mess with cops in ways you can't necessarily do in real life, such as hacking a computer and turning the lights off on the other side of the room, or using a chainsaw to make an officer pass out from fear. I also really got a kick out of the fact that when you are cutting up a corpse, it gets censored. I have really enjoyed Serial Cleaners, I just suggest that if you have kids, play this one after they go to sleep as it is quite bloody.","Serial Cleaners expands on the original game nicely, with a good variety of missions and characters to play. It has its niggles, but for the most part this is a fun way to spend a few hours.",,,,,"Serial Cleaners is a stealth action game in isometric view with an incomparable mix of blood, irony and great dialogues.",,"Serial Cleaners comes with a new style and attitude, taking inspiration from some of the great crime films of the 80s and 90s to tell a four-sided tale. It's an enjoyable return for the original game's quirky take on crime scene cleaning, but only takes a few small steps forward, leaving the limits of its stealth-action gameplay evident to see.",,,,"Serial Cleaners is a stealth game with a unique concept and an apt visual style, but with not too original gameplay by the standards of the genre. Nevertheless, the excellent presentation makes it a worthy title for all fans of the genre.","Serial Cleaners is the logical evolution of the franchise, but it fails in what is most important: the gameplay. Its imprecise controls and its tendency to trial and error do not compensate for the visual and narrative improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,"While Serial Cleaners isn’t without its issues, this macabre mop-’em-up has its moments, but only the most patient custodians of carnage will likely want to see it through to the end. The writing is fantastic, and the characters all bring something new and exciting to the table with their various talents. If you enjoyed the original game and can look beyond the grime and viscera that occasionally gunk up the experience, you might just find Serial Cleaners to be a dirty job worth undertaking. It’s not much, but it’s honest work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kao-the-kangaroo,,,,"Kao The Kangaroo is a hard one to sum up, then, because while it definitely feels low-budget, clunky and frustrating at times, it's also a platformer packed with plenty of fun and memorable moments. It feels like the developer went the extra mile to inject some ambition into the series and craft something that deserves a place alongside the behemoths of the genre, even if it can't meet the lofty heights of a Crash Bandicoot or a Super Lucky's Tale. It's nice to see Kao punching above his weight in 2022, and not just being relegated to an easy cash grab.","Anyone who has a hole in their life where a new Spyro, Banjo or Jak should have been will find plenty to love here with Kao the Kangaroo.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Kao the Kangaroo is a well-crafted game that pulls inspiration from several other platforming greats, but a lack of polish and an abundance of bugs end up dragging it down.","Exploration, search for collectibles, clashes against enemies and bosses… the formula is ultra-known, but the work of Tate Multimedia offers a great adventure thanks to its successful graphics and an immersive cartoon atmosphere.","Kao the Kangaroo is a classic 3D adventure platformer. Sadly, its reliance on well-trodden mechanics hinders the action. Moreover, there are better examples of the genre. However, its graphics, audio, and variety of environments are fantastic. It's a shame that the rest of the game isn't as inventive or as polished. If they were, this would have been a great game.",,"Kao the Kangaroo is a well-meaning game, and despite some missteps, it is in my opinion one of the better 3D platformers of modern gaming.",,,,,,,,"There’s a lot of enjoyable gameplay in Kao the Kangaroo. The level design is easily the biggest highlight, and while combat is simple, it’s fun and accessible for all ages to get a kick out of. The downfalls of poor voice acting and a forgettable soundtrack are easy enough to overlook; the only thing Kao really needs are fixes to the aforementioned glitches and bugs that are the sole things holding it back from being a solid and enjoyable experience all the way throughout. Assuming these all get fixed, however, Kao the Kangaroo would be worth picking up for those looking for a fun and nostalgic platformer that hearkens back to the early 3D days, but with nice modern modifications.",,"The best way to describe Tate Multimedia’s title would be as a Madeleine de Proust. It really does feel like a throwback to the platform games of the early 2000s, and holy guacamole that feels good! Strongly reminiscent of titles like Rayman 3D, Super Mario 64 or Banjo-Kazooie, it certainly does not reinvent the formula, and one might even find it too unoriginal. There is indeed no risk-taking as regards the gameplay or the features. Nevertheless, even though Kao the Kangaroo rehashes a time-tested recipe, it does it with style and grace. It feels like we are jumping back in time twenty years with all the best features video games had back then: a fun, colourful title, adapted to all audiences and pleasant to play if one can sweep the few technical problems under the rug. Here, Tate Multimedia offers a nice tribute to the old-school 3D platformers – and with an extra dash of ambition – this title could have become a true classic. If your childhood or teenage years seem too far away, let Kao and its adventures be your ride to nostalgia!","Kao The Kangaroo is an excellent 3D platformer that captures the magic of the golden era. The solid mechanics and great level design make this nostalgic adventure a joy. Even though it’s not particularly difficult and sticks to conventions, it will keep you hooked from beginning to end.",,,,,,,,,"Kao the Kangaroo is a fun jump through memory lane that delivers an enjoyable (albeit slightly repetitive) experience in classic arcade 3D platforming fashion. However the character, graphics and worlds lends itself well on the Xbox Series X with a very smooth control system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While not reinventing absolutely anything, Kao the Kangaroo has proved to be a valid and delightful platformer.",,"Children are much more capable than we sometimes give credit for, and Kao’s by-the-numbers design would likely bore all but the most nascent of gamers. Kao the Kangaroo isn’t a total disaster by any means. It just feels aggressively average and forgettable which, sadly, has been the case for the mascot for years.",,,,,"Simple and fun, Kao the Kangaroo is a platformer that despite having minor flaws is worth playing: it's a fine tribute to the 3D platformers of the heydays.",,"Kao The Kangaroo is a love letter to the platforms of 90s and early 2000s, with all their strengths and weaknesses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kao the Kangaroo feels like a game that has more potential that wasn't executed on, but the vibrant visuals go a really long way.",,,,,,"Kao the Kangaroo might not be the most innovative, difficult, or narratively satisfying platformer out there, but this game still nails the basics. As such, any fan of modern 3D platformers will find a lot to enjoy with this reboot of Kao the Kangaroo and maybe even be inspired to check out the forgotten classics Kao starred in.",,,,,,,,,,,,I mostly enjoyed my time with Kao the Kangaroo as it brought me back to the early 2000s when 3D platformers were plentiful and memorable. It may not be a shining example of the genre but it's fun enough for those who are nostalgic for the good old days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite the issues, bugs, and nitpicks I have with 2022’s take on Kao the Kangaroo, at the end of the day the game is functionally playable, looks gorgeous, and there’s plenty of fun to be had with it especially in regards to platforming and combat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
last-stop,,"As narrative adventures go, Last Stop is easily one of the best I’ve played. From setting and characters, to story and presentation, it is a joy to experience from start to finish. Whether you’re a Game Pass subscriber or not, this is one title not to miss out on.",,,"This could have been Life is Strange: London and we wouldn’t have bat an eyelid. And that’s where the greatest disappointment derives from: Virginia was so proudly and ebulliently unconventional, yet Last Stop hues so closely to convention. It’s an episode of The Twilight Zone; a more committee-created Quantic Dream game. There’s no doubt that it’s enjoyable and has wonderful, memorable moments, but its biggest crime is that it doesn’t emerge with a voice of its own.",,A script with good dialogues and interesting situations.,,,,,,,,,,,"Last Stop gave us an overall pleasant experience by concocting three distinct plots with fair flavors. Precise rhythm, convincing characters, story that keeps us in suspense: there is no doubt that the Variable State studio masters its pen. What a pity that the player's freedom is so compartmentalized by its lack of impact on events and that the technical quality tarnishes the experience. The adventure will however prove to be appreciable for fervent fans of narrative games who are just waiting to discover an entertaining story.",,,,,,,"Last Stop tells a wonderful story that is well worth your time. There’s just so little that feels like a video game in it. Most of what is here feels like it’s included because someone was afraid players had too little to do. At its best Last Stop feels more like watching a solid season of TV. That’s not inherently a bad thing. A few sequences, however, show how embracing the gaming format is able to enhance it, and definitely left me wanting more. As long as you go in with the right expectations, though, I think you’ll find a lot to like.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Last Stop tells three interesting stories, but lacks enough meaningful choices or consequences to create investment in its drama.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It will entertain fans of the genre, but it won't make them fall in love. Much flatter and more conventional than Virginia.",,Variable State surprisingly managed to create a really unique and vibrant world in Last Stop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Last Stop is an engaging piece of entertainment, but not really an entertaining game to play. The fun of the narrative can't overcome the lackluster gameplay and nonexistent player choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
somerville,,"Though it may not be quite as thought-provoking as the games that inspired it, Somerville is a promising effort from a new studio, capably evoking its themes and happenings through its visual storytelling, in a way that makes you ponder and feel for the characters and their situations. Unfortunately, Somerville can’t remove itself from the shadow of Playdead’s works, so it is inevitably stuck in the position of inferiority, because it doesn’t do much we haven’t seen before. Having said that, it is a worthwhile adventure that may start slow, but picks up momentum the more you play and is backed up by decent puzzles and some pulse-quickening and heart-thumping drama. All told Somerville is a pleasant slice of thought-provoking adventuring.",,"Somerville is a super-stylish slice of sci-fi that nails its aesthetic and provides a solid narrative that comes to a pleasingly surreal and fantastical end. However, all of this good stuff is bogged down by dull gameplay, performance issues and the addition of a third dimension that, while certainly very cool to look at, leads to awkwardness as you attempt to solve puzzles and interact with environments. If you can make peace with the gameplay, you'll still find a story worth experiencing here, it's just a shame there wasn't as much creativity in those puzzles as there is in every other aspect of what Jumpship has served up.","Somerville is an important addition to our gaming diet. It’s not worried about pushing boundaries in terms of narrative structure or story, and never wants to guide the player too much, letting them find their own journey through a brilliant linear adventure.",,"With his particular vision of The War of the Worlds, Somerville proposes a precious cinematic adventure focused on narration.",,"Somerville is a fantastically evocative game as it depicts an everyman's journey through a War of the Worlds-like alien invasion, leaning on countless sci-fi tropes and ideas along the way. Disappointingly, it's undercut on a number of levels by controls and a detached feeling and hastiness with some parts of the story it's telling.",,,,"Somerville takes us on an intimate and dramatic journey through a world now close to unraveling, enriched by puzzles that shape a satisfying gaming offering, but unfortunately some design choices and a less-than-perfect packaging do not allow the game to shine and touch heights of excellence. Still, it remains a fascinating and disturbing journey that you are unlikely to forget, and that is enough to rightfully belong in the experiences every gamer should have.",,"Overall, Somerville has a fantastic and intriguing world that’s begging to be explored from the off. Wonderful art and sound design compounded with excellent character animations really bring this narrative adventure to life, but a smattering of bugs, lacklustre puzzle elements, and an ambiguous story that left me feeling unrewarded after posing so many initial questions, really hampered the experience.",,,,,,"Somerville feels like great ambition being stretched a little thin, and fundamentally, the way it feels to actually play makes me wish it spent a little longer in the oven, refining and polishing the best parts.",,,,"Despite its issues, Somerville manages to offer a mostly enjoyable experience. The family bond forged in an opening scene, which is easily the highlight of Somerville, simply works and drove me through the game. I wanted to figure out what happened to my character’s family and see them together again, and that kept me going through a relatively short game. ",,,,,,"With his previous works, Dino Patti got us used to dark and suffocating worlds and Somerville is no exception to this rule. Through his art direction and soundtrack, he completely immerses us in the drama experienced by our character. This narrative experience skilfully alternates between action and reflection phases and does not suffer from any break in the writing rhythm. Although the title deserves the status of a gold nugget, we would have liked the development team to step out of its comfort zone and take more risks to enrich the proposal.",,,,,,,,,,Somerville is a true “short and sweet” gaming experience that really throws a spanner into traditional storytelling and gaming.,,"Somerville does for Inside for what Inside did for Limbo. While the means of gameplay has evolved into a 3D realm, it's more an emphasis on an actual narrative that sets it apart.","Somerville puts a unique spin on the Inside formula, and though it isn't quite as impactful as the games that inspired it, it's still a haunting, well-made adventure.",,"Somerville is one of the year’s biggest surprises, and I’m still shocked to see it fly under the radar. Its portrayal of an alien invasion raging across the British countryside hit close to home, while the story of a father searching for his family and being tied up in a dilemma so much bigger than he ever imagined is both nothing like I expected and everything I wanted. I can’t wait to see players far smarter than I piece its most devious puzzles together, since there are still so many questions waiting to be answered.",,,"Somerville is a tight experience that tells its tale, doesn’t leave you hanging too long, and gives you plenty to ruminate on. Some rough edges hold it back from hitting the heights of those that inspired it.",,,,,,,,,,"Somerville aims high, very high, succeeding in certain things (puzzle design, atmosphere, and scenic impact) and missing the target in others (emotional involvement, technical cleanliness, weak central part). In the end, the experience is certainly pleasant but never shocking, a short and evocative journey in the middle of an alien apocalypse with some scenes capable of remaining impressed for a long time, despite often missing that ludo-narrative amalgam to connect them. A promising debut for Jumpship, with a perfect Game Pass title that could easily be finished in an evening but would have deserved some extra refinement.",,,,"It feels like cheating to call Somerville a debut indie title when its creator’s individual pedigree is so strong, but it’s a tremendous spiritual successor to both Limbo and Inside. It takes an ordinary setting, quickly removes all normalcy, and takes the player on a fleeting sci-fi thrill ride that makes use of every second of your attention that it has.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"A disappointing follow-up to Limbo and Inside that lacks the same complexity of plot and puzzles, and yet struggles surprisingly poorly with the move to 3D.",,,,,,,,"Somerville is an exceptional project with huge missed potential, reason being the overall weak technical state. The game is just raw and would greatly benefit from at least another six month of dev time.",,,,,,,,,,"Short games aren't inherently flawed, but Somerville needed a bit more time to convey its major themes. The scope of the alien invasion story looks at both macro and micro relationships among people in ways that only end up scratching the surface of saying something interesting, and though it builds up an interesting universe that leaves me with questions regarding its alien overlords, I was surprised to find in myself an indifference toward finding the truth that's out there.",,,,,"Somerville feels like a game that is going through growing pains. As the first title to come from Jumpship, there's a fair amount to like here and quite a bit that can be built off of moving forward. Still, Somerville isn't also without its problems, especially when it comes to creating an enjoyable gameplay experience. As a result, Somerville itself isn't something that I would deem a must-play, but Jumpship as a whole is a studio that I'll continue to keep an eye on as time goes on. ",,,"Somerville's biggest strengths are the atmosphere and story, which both give room for thought. But the puzzles are very easy and lack variation. Despite all that, Somerville is just like Limbo and Inside worth the effort.",,"Somerville is a nice looking adventure game with a unique puzzle element idea, but narrative and performance inconsistencies leave the overall experience a bit muted.",,,,,,,"Somerville is the only game that has ever had me hiding from aliens in a grimy festival Portaloo. Yet its last-ditch attempt at a galaxy-brain sci-fi ending lands with a disappointing thud. While its head-scratcher finale leaves you wishing its nonverbal narrative was a little more verbal, Somerville remains a masterclass in minimal storytelling; a series of memorable, haunting vignettes.",,,,,,"An escape from alien invasion, with beautiful art direction.",,,,,"If you expect Somerville to be as polished and gripping as the all-time favourite Inside, you are in for a disappointment. The game sure has its moments, even though it turns into a slog pretty fast.",,,,,,,,,"With low quality puzzles and unpolished motion for certain objects, Somerville feels rough around the edges when compared with the games that made its creators so well regarded. Sudden twists in the game’s second half feel unnatural, and the multiple endings don’t feel different enough from one another. That being said, the studio’s potential can be felt throughout the game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Somerville is a fantastic debut for Jumpship that should be commended, but a little extra polish in some key areas would have made an already great game even better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-ascent,,"All in all, The Ascent is a lot of fun at times, but there’s just something about it that doesn’t quite stick for me. Combat is fast, with the three height system technically offering up more options for arenas, but I found this aspect to be generally underused. Initially complex looking, the upgrades and skill trees are simple to follow, albeit underwhelming in use. But there’s no denying just how pretty it all is, and as a next gen showpiece it delivers here. I just can’t see myself being drawn back to it long in the long term.",,,"Experiences like The Ascent don’t come along often. Game Pass may well turn out to be The Ascent’s redemption. This is an experience that’s best had in co-op, and a day one launch on Xbox’s service means that almost all obstacles are removed. So, find three friends and take your time with The Ascent, refuse to play in long sessions, and you and your partners will find worlds and gunplay that blow your augments clear off.","The Ascent is an unapologetically familiar twin stick shooter, with a detailed cyberpunk world that feels alive and especially dystopian. Some mistakes in the way the map is implemented and a fast travel that is unreasonable limited could have been alleviated, but nevertheless the action is top-notch and cathartic.","With the recent experience of Cyberpunk 2077, The Ascent has managed to amaze me with its aesthetics, its artistic section and its powerful and impressive graphics.",,,"The Ascent is a solid evolution of the twin-stick formula, offering some of the most detailed and impressive visuals the gen has to offer so far. However, The Ascent needs a couple of polish passes as of writing, due to bugs and other glitches. Additionally, the game suffers from a lack of testing, with balance problems and structural issues that weaken the latter half of the game.",,,"The Ascent is a solid and fun action-RPG, capable of providing many hours of fun thanks to well-paced gameplay and powerful and inspired graphics. Too bad for some flaws such as the poorly executed cooperative mode, annoying bugs and the lack of Italian localization, which prevent the first job of Neon Giant to shine as it deserves.","The Ascent brings us all the frenzy and strategy of a chaotic and futuristic cyberpunk-style world, where our character must discover the places and secrets that this universe hides. Despite its flaws, it becomes an Xbox essential.","The Ascent is a beautiful and entertaining action-RPG when everything is working as intended, but those moments are sadly much rarer than they should be. We know the team already has several patches planned so hopefully, a lot of the issues we encountered will be ironed out by the time you dive into the game — I'll be keeping an eye on these updates and will look to update and/or modify this review should things be significantly improved, because I'd have liked to have scored The Ascent higher. Combat is frantic and fun, the world is amazing, and there are some really satisfying abilities to bust out against foes, but you need a hell of a lot of patience to put up with all the technical nonsense going on with the game in its current state.",,"A grim, dystopian future shock, The Ascent is an action-packed ARPG brimming with guns and ultra-violence. It's enormous fun, especially in co-op, but bothersome bugs and repetitive quests unfortunately put a dampener on things.","Beautiful to fall for, fun and nervous, The Ascent is a generous twin stick shooter, which evolves in a coherent world with neat lore. If the optimization of the game as the ergonomics of the navigation or the interface remain to be reviewed and can sometimes be frustrating, the whole is sufficiently solid on its shoot part as an RPG to occupy you for long hours, solo or with friends . A great way to get back on track for the small team of Neon Giant, whose game is available as soon as it is released on the Game Pass.",,,,,,"Despite some of the more minor issues listed above, there was very little that was able to pull me away from The Ascent in the past week or so that I’ve been playing, and it’s certainly a game I’d like to revisit post launch with a fresh character so I can toy around with different builds and loadouts a bit more. Again, it’s an absolute no-brainer if you’re a Game Pass subscriber on Xbox, but even if you’re looking to purchase the game outright, it’s absolutely worth checking out.","If you’re playing with others, I imagine you’ll have a great time with The Ascent. While it still isn’t anywhere near perfect, the beautiful graphics and solid gunplay should be enough for those who just want something cool to play with their friends. There’s plenty of loot to collect along the way, too, letting you each put your stamp on your character. If you have no one to play with, though, I wouldn’t recommend The Ascent. The game feels like it’s fighting against you the entire way. It never stops feeling like this game wasn’t meant for you.",,,,"The cyberpunk world of The Ascent seems dazzling on the surface, but much like your standard cyberpunk world, the grime underneath all of the neon and futuristic landscapes ends up revealing a hefty mess once you go exploring it. The top-down shooter gameplay is fun on a basic level, but quickly becomes monotonous as it drags on in order to keep up with the RPG-styled length and ambitions, while the RPG side of things has a good story and some nifty gameplay tweaks, but its desire to keep the gameplay focus on being a top-down shooter means that any potential when it comes to depth and variety is never fully realized. If you’re a die-hard cyberpunk fan, don’t mind a lot of repetition or have friends to join along, there can be fun here as you ascend, but the rest might be better skipping the trip up.",,"As we draw our conclusions, it seems important to note that The Ascent was created by a small team of skilled developers. And what else is there to say except maybe that they completed the challenge with flying colours. For almost 15 hours, Neon Giant’s game puts the RPG aspect aside to embark us on a huge romp through a larger-than-life city, whose AD rivals that of Cyberpunk 2077. Those fond of finesse and detail-oriented builds will need to go somewhere else. For the others, it would be difficult to miss the Swedish studio’s first game as it was released in the Xbox Game Pass on its launch. Visually speaking, this one is quite outstanding and is a pure action guilty pleasure made of gunpowder, metal and blood. While waiting to be able to enjoy a 4-player coop session, we’re already dreaming of a probable second part developed by a larger team. Hopefully, this would be enough to improve what needs to be improved and revamp the game from being a pleasant surprise to being a must-have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Ascent combines excellent worldbuilding, satisfying role playing, exciting combat, and stellar visuals to deliver an astounding action RPG.",,,"While The Ascent is a true visual showcase for the Xbox Series X, it lacks depth and clarity. There's a fun game in here, but it's ultimately overburdened.","The Ascent’s satisfying gun-tastic action-RPG gameplay loop mixes with its beautiful cyberpunk aesthetic to create an overall enjoyable experience. Neither its story nor its characters are all that memorable, and its enemy encounters can stumble toward the end, but its gunplay and ultra-violence in a neon-soaked world combine to craft a co-op-friendly game you don’t see every day.","The Ascent opens impressively and displays a solid core, which regrettably starts to sour early, especially if you play on your own. Load times, illegible text and repetitive structure mean that the console experience is lacking.",,,,,,"The Ascent is a top-down Cyberpunk 2077 with a Blade Runner vibe and Housemarque-esque gameplay. Of those three influences, only the Blade Runner part is unfortunately really successful, because the atmosphere is thick and the game is incredibly beautiful thanks to subtle lighting and convincing particle effects. The twinstick shooter action is a bit less successful and the RPG elements also leave something to be desired, so you probably won't disappear completely in this. Although it is quite clever that a twelve-strong studio has delivered this end product.","The Ascent reminds me of the good old days of Xbox 360 and its robust indie offerings on the old Xbox Live Arcade service, where games like “Shadow Complex” or “Super Meat Boy” were not afraid of making small twists to classic formulas.",,"The Ascent is an ambitious work, which fascinates with incredible atmospheres and visually breathtaking scenarios. Unfortunately, the exceptional production effort carried out on the sets and modeling of the game world does not hide some problems related to the balance of the gameplay and the quality of the script. In short, as far as the creation of the imaginary is concerned, we can say that we are faced with a great little blockbuster of the Microsoft and PC offer: a shame not to be able to remember the splendid streets of Veles as an absolute excellence of the indie market.",,,"A visual feast that, along with the great audio design, makes for a very atmospheric experience. It's not perfect, though. Navigation leaves a bit to be desired and some technical shortcomings put a damper on the fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,A gorgeous looking cyberpunk world and intense shoot-outs: The Ascent is visually impressive and delivers bucketloads of shooting fun. But it is a complete failure in terms of storytelling and has a few (co-op) flaws.,,,A deeply disappointing co-op shooter that squanders its excellent graphics on a bland and repetitive attempt to make a sci-fi Diablo.,,,,,,The Ascent offers cyberpunk lovers a setting where they can unleash their dreams of steel and neon.,,"The Ascent is worth your attention, but only after the developers iron out most of the major shortcomings.",,,,,,,"Although The Ascent is far from perfect, it gets more right than it does wrong and is most successful at creating a world that is filled with interesting characters and fun to explore. The sections that require some grinding might frustrate, but there is enough variety in the combat to keep the gameplay from becoming stale thanks to the wide array of weapons and the cover mechanics. Add in the possibility for co-op multiplayer with some friends and The Ascent can certainly provide hours of riotous fun, especially with a release on Xbox Game Pass day one.",,"Fans of twin-stick shooters and action RPGs are likely to get a good amount of fun out of The Ascent, especially if they have the patience to work though some of its issues. The fact that it looks so pretty, at least on Xbox Series X, means that some may find more of a reason to persist with it, too. With its merely passable story and small assortment of gameplay frustrations, however, it’s not quite the game it could have been. It simply feels a bit rough around the edges, though perhaps a patch or two could smooth them off.","Even if The Ascent was fully functional and balanced in a way where building up a character to become the ultimate Indent warrior felt great, there's the fact that so much of the game is designed to feel like servitude. As you climb the superstructure housing all of Veles, you serve a progression of masters, and the payoff for the game's central mystery--where did the mysterious group running Veles suddenly run off to?--isn't nearly enough to offset the hopeless grind. Your bosses insult you when you go on your task, ignore you when you've done well, and provide no rewards for success. For so much of the play time, The Ascent feels like, well, an uphill battle.",,,,,,,,,"Despite my complaints, though, I legitimately love the world Neon Giant has crafted here and would love to see even more of it. There’s loads of potential in this setting for straight-up better stories to be told, and I think The Ascent itself is kept from greatness from a lot of jank, technical issues, and weird design decisions. All that said, I think once I get my hands on a Steam Deck, I’m absolutely going to treat that as an excuse to go back for more. Hopefully, by then, they’ll have a lot of the technical issues addressed.",,,,,,,"In The Ascent, which offers a menu of main and side missions and runs to over twenty hours, there is only one strategy: shoot those in front of you until they are in front of you no longer. True, we get the standard stream of skill points, to feed into our preferred areas: aim, balance, movement speed, etc. And you can upgrade your cyberdeck, the better to melt the circuits of enemies and locked doors. But it all comes back to open-plan gunning, and it takes more than ballistics to persuade us of real freedom.",,"The Ascent is a wonderful experience that is easy to recommend thanks to Game Pass. It has some technical issues, some bugs, and also takes a while to get to the point, but it is worth the investment. There is little reason to not check it out if you have Game Pass. This is a game that is great with friends and even solo manages to entertain. I hope they continue to clean up the bugs over time, but for now it is easily one of my favorite experiences of the Summer.",,,,,,,,,,,"Style over substance – I bet Neon Giant has this cyberpunk principle printed above the office entrance. The design of their game is absolutely breathtaking, with huge, vertical, crime-infested cities and masterful use of lights and shadows. Add a pulp-style story and good dialogues (or rather monologues, as the protagonist is silent) immersed deeply in the cyberpunk lore, and you’ve got a pure gem for anyone who enjoys this setting. The shooting mechanics and progression system might be overly simple, but they get the job done and make it easier to catch the game’s flow. [10/2021, p.56]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Ascent nails the cyberpunk aesthetic but doesn't really attempt to capitalise on its themes of corporate slavery. The solid audiovisuals and competent action-RPG twin-stick shooter hybrid gameplay manage to glue the experience together, even when glaring flaws such as lacklustre quest design and an overreliance on backtracking threaten to derail it.","The Ascent is an essential experience for anyone that enjoys tight action-RPG combat or beautiful, neon-colored Blade Runner skylines. Go play this solo or with up to three other friends before its world becomes reality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dakar-desert-rally,,Overall Dakar Desert Rally is a diamond in the rough. With the upcoming features adding another layer to the game and a little bit of rounding off and Saber Porto/Saber Interactive have come up with a winner. Newcomers and casual racer fans will love how the game looks and have plenty of fun in sport mode while hardcore fans or players who love a challenge will have a great time mastering.,,,"Dakar Desert Rally can feel great, until you start trying to drive anywhere, and then it is quite a let down. There is the opportunity to learn to drive around these issues (and just accept that AI drivers will hit you, avoiding them as best you can), but Dakar Desert Rally fails to ever really flow.",,"Dakar Desert Rally brings the most dangerous competition in the world to our consoles four years later. Despite the failures that it may present, we are facing a delivery that has everything to become a very beloved and fun franchise.",,,,,,"Dakar Desert Rally shows great potential accompanied, however, by many minor shortcomings, but it succeeds in effectively transposing the spirit of desert racing, its colors, breathtaking views and sense of adventure.",,,,,"Despite a lack of content, perfectible driving and unsophisticated opponents, Dakar Desert Rally comes to dust off the automotive genre with style. Based on the sumptuous landscapes of Saudi Arabia, Saber Interactive's game displays a remarkable achievement and should delight those looking for a different racing game. If the developers have kept the requirement of Dakar 18 (with co-pilot, compass, roadbook, etc.), it is now possible to try out Sport mode and its arcade approach. Thanks to these additions, Dakar Desert Rally opens up to a wider audience without cutting itself off from purists. With its impression of successful speed, its panoramas and sumptuous effects and its huge map, there is plenty to have fun while waiting for possible extensions. Undoubtedly the automotive surprise of this fall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"With an official Dakar licence, a bewitching and gigantic playing field, arcade and simulation modes, vast improvements as regards the driving of the various vehicles compared to Dakar 18 and a navigation feature via road-book as exhilarating and immersive as ever, Dakar Desert Rally has enough solid foundations to become a prime showcase for rally-raid and its flagship event as long they keep on working hard on it. The new Career mode even welcomes neophytes with open arms to gradually introduce them to the discipline. Unfortunately, the title suffers from a premature release that spoils the game experience due to a feeble framerate, chaotic AI and a frustrating lack of content for fans of the simulation mode. In the coming weeks, the ambitious roadmap should meet the latter’s expectations. Let us hope the studio manages to solve the technical issues as well. If this happens, Dakar Desert Rally will surely become a must-have game for all motorsports fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"To its credit, Dakar Desert Rally has a fabulous sense of scale and is capable of some great, unique racing – especially when bombing over barren, building-sized sand dunes in a big rig while kicking up huge rooster tails of sand in search of a mysterious navigation marker. It is, however, dramatically undercut by unstable and annoying handling for several of its vehicle classes, its uneven performance mode frame rate, and some significant bugs that can cost you hours of progress. This game needed more time in the service area before being cleared to compete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sport mode is a mess and doesn't do justice to the incredible qualities of Dakar Desert Rally.

Following to roadbook to find your path in this absolutely huge Saudi Arabia feels really great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dakar Desert Rally still feels like an Early Access game, and while there is huge potential and the driving will win you over, there is very little content and important options and features are missing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
elex-ii,"ELEX II offers a continuation of the foundations that ELEX was built upon while providing you dynamic story options to choose your path, new characters and factions that enrich a narrative that thankfully continues. Faults and flaws aside, THQ Nordic created a game that was fun to play and, in the end, that's the only thing that matters.","Elex 2 has come a long way from the first game back in 2017. Graphically it looks much better and the storyline feels much more robust. The story mode difficulty has made the game much more accessible for those just wanting to play and enjoy the story. The combat hasn’t pushed on too much but it’s not terrible, but it does feel a bit dated. But if you are a big RPG fan then there is plenty of content to sink your teeth into.",,,"ELEX II might struggle to find a market when it is put alongside other open-world games, but ultimately there is a lot of good adventuring to be found in this neat RPG.","Elex II, as with all PB games, bites more that it can chew. Frustrating AI, clunky-janky gameplay and an engine that’s now a bit too old for wear are definite issues here, and the last 1/3 of the game feels like an afterthought. For fans of PB and western RPGs though, there is still a lot to love and enjoy in the second part of Jax’s story and in the wonderful world of Magalan.","If you like classic RPGs and are able to make big concessions on the technical side, Elex 2 is a game not to be missed.",,,,,,"ELEX II is as vast, free and engaging as it is crude and flawed. Over-the-top elements clash with a lame technical side and a flawed enemy AI, in a continuous roller coaster of conflicting emotions. It may involve you deeply as well as you may come to hate it for its many imperfections and the punishing difficulty, but however it goes you won't fail to realize this is a game made with heart.","If I have to say something about Elex II is that this is a particular game. If you were a fan of the initial game, you will like this one. But if you didn't play it, you might have a less than satisfying experience. The idea of a minimalist hud, an open world that you have to explore to discover its secrets, difficulty in combat, is striking. But there are many things that are not satisfactory, the main one being the combat. Elex II does not manage to get out of that feeling that you are playing a retro game, having been released in 2022.",,,,,"Elex II attempts to create a vast and beautiful game that juxtaposes the horrendous nature of the plot. Sadly, its delivery of key mechanics slows the action to a crawl. Furthermore, the terrible controls and archaic combat lack fluidity while stalling your progress. It should have been excellent, but it falls well short of its goals.",,,,,"Personally, I don’t see the appeal, but if its janky, dated RPGs you’re after, it’ll be everything you’re hoping for.","Elex II presents a world and narrative of immeasurable depth in terms of the freedom you have to play your way and the choices you’re presented with as a player. Couple that with an extremely gratifying sense of progression, and you have a world that begs to be visited for repeat playthroughs. If you can look past the inevitable lack of polish, and archaic presentation issues, do yourself a favor and don't let this absolute gem pass you by.",,,,,,"Piranha Bytes is known for its – technically speaking – old school productions with rich content. Elex 2 further confirms this reputation and remains a title that one loves as much as he hates it. It will take many hours of suffering before you can really enjoy it. Therefore, it’s hard for the average player to get involved in a game that is graphically outdated and whose gameplay transforms the combat phases into real torture. A title to be reserved for fans of the studio or pad masochists.",,,,,,,"ELEX II is a good example of being in the right place but at the wrong time. It’s a great action role playing with some killer gameplay mechanisms and quest designs, but it just can’t compete at the moment, and thus not getting the attention it deserves.",,,,,,,,,,,"While a little rough around the edge, this anachronistic RPG charms in unexpected ways and offers a better jumping on point for the franchise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This may have stood a minor chance in the bone dry days of summer, but with so many truly remarkable open world experiences currently on offer at the moment, it’s tough to see why anyone would opt for Elex II.",,,,Elex II returns with an acceptable proposal that will delight Piranha Bytes fans but without achieving the qualitative leap it needs to attract the general public.,,,,,"Ultimately, Elex 2 has some small shortcomings like any video game but not where it matters. If players can look past the rough edges, they’ll find an open-world RPG that puts others to shame and a proper sequel that takes everything from the first game and improves upon it tenfold.","There are lots of problems, and yet Elex II will hold your attention with a tight grip, even after 60 hours of playtime. All thanks to the crazy setting, worldbuilding, and exploration gameplay.",,,,,,,,,,,"Elex II is a blast, both literally and figuratively. What Piranha Bytes was able to achieve in Elex I they were able to build upon, expanding on a world that lives and breathes independently and because of your character. Aside from those little technical issues, the game is sound. I feel like you could also easily get into playing Elex II without having played the first game. However, if you want to understand all of the references, maybe at least watch a recap video first. Either way, this game holds a lot of promise, especially when you consider all the different routes you can take on your playthrough. Who knows where you’ll end up?",,,,,,,,,,"The combat system is weak and some parts of the graphics seem heavily outdated. But Elex II is much more than the sum of its parts. It is a highly atmospheric and intense role-playing game with marvelous quest design, a worthwhile open world with an ultimate vision of freedom for story-driven games whose overall experience will make you forget most of its weak points.","ELEX 2 outdoes its predecessor in every way. The story is more interesting, the character writing is even deeper, and the threats are far more colorful and deadly. While the ending promises a third chapter to come, I only hope the devs fix the combat next time — perhaps they should just ditch melee entirely? Ranged weaponry is the only thing really working here, so perhaps double down on that and focus entirely on guns, arrows, and spells — it works well enough in games like Mass Effect, so why not try it in an open-world context? ELEX 2 is just one failed element away from being a truly great game — unfortunately, that element is ‘Action’ and it’s an Action-RPG.",,,,,,"Like most RPG’s Jax will not save the world alone, Elex 2 does offer some companions to take along on the journey. Only one at a time can accompany the player but because the AI is so laughably bad in this game, they really only serve a purpose as a ‘meat shield’. Honestly, my companions were getting dropped more than they were hitting enemies in almost every instance. It was about this time that I really began to wonder what people were talking about when they praised the original game so much. Maybe it is that much better than this one, but Elex 2 is pretty bad. Worse than that I personally didn’t find it fun, no disrespect to those that love it. As I said at the outset, I don’t mind ‘janky’ games, but Elex 2 was just ‘bridge too far’ for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s endearing how hard Piranha Bytes tries with Elex II, but its head and heart are much too big for its body. It takes too long for the combat to become bearable, and the story, while ambitious, doesn’t quite reach the heavens it aims for. If you’re already enamored with Magalan, Elex II offers enough to re-immerse you in that world to make a second visit worthwhile. But everyone else should probably stay home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
high-on-life,"High on Life is a fantastic addition to the Xbox catalog. Even if it wasn’t in Xbox Gamepass I would be recommending you play this game for its story, Metroidvania exploration and Trick Holes. Since it’s included with Xbox Gamepass it’s a no-brainer to check out. If you are a fan of the Roiland style humor then you are in for a real treat. There were so many times I had to pause the game and set the controller down because I was so shocked by something that was said or done. It was a pleasant surprise to be caught off guard like that in a game and I really look forward to what Squanch Games does next. Hopefully it's a sequel to this must play game.",,"High on Life continues Squanch Games’ propensity for skewering video game tropes, this time in the form of a first-person shooter. Unfortunately, a lot of the game plays like a first draft, and armor of detached irony doesn’t do enough to protect it from its many, many kinks. Roiland’s personal brand of gross-out parody and “oh, geez” improvisational humor is already starting to feel routine in video game form, but there are a few standout bits. Thankfully, there’s a pretty fun shooter underneath all the alien semen, though stiff animations and some buggy moments can make it look slightly underbaked. If you’re a fan of Rick and Morty (or, more appropriately, “Doc and Mharti”), then High on Life might just be the pickup you need—but it never fully develops any of its really good ideas into a satisfying final draft.","High On Life combines sloppy shooter action with Justin Roiland and all of his pals being incredibly annoying. You're either going to love it or hate it, really, so it's lucky this one's hitting Game Pass so you can check it out and decide for yourselves. Personally, this reviewer hated the humour, there's something very off and deeply troubling at the heart of where this game is coming from, it feels as though it's looking down, sneering and hateful. But that's the comedy style it's going for so we guess we need to relax, bro. Some people are going to eat this stuff up, regardless of what we think, so it's a shame that it ties this sneering attitude to bland gameplay, tired puzzles, dumb AI and a world that just isn't fun to explore or inhabit in any way. Dude. That is harsh.","High on Life is crass, vulgar, excessive, padded and features a comedy style that is incredibly subjective. However, it also has a ton of heart, strong gunplay, surprisingly good level design, a unique tone and, above all else, it's just plain fun.",,"High on Life comes to our consoles and is consolidated as one of the great surprises of the year. A fun delivery, full of action and uncensored humor that will make your games incredibly funny.","A fun game that, even if it doesn’t do anything particularly well gameplay-wise, makes the most of its particular sense of humor to keep the player entertained.","High on Life is a conflicted game. On the one hand it's a solid shooter that often feels like more than the sum of its parts, and comes with an engaging art style and ideas, but the sense of humour is just so subjective that it's hard to recommend to anyone that isn't a die hard Rick and Morty fan.",,,"High on Life perfectly blends tried-and-true Metroidvania and classic first-person shooter elements with Justin Roiland and Squanch Games’ distinctive brand of dark, fourth wall-breaking comedy, resulting in an action-adventure that no gamer should dare miss out on, especially when it is being offered for free to anyone with an Xbox Game Pass subscription.","High On Life combines simple FPS gameplay with an attractive design, a wide variety of weapons, and exaggerated writing that makes every moment unforgettable. Although it has some shortcomings, such as the simple enemy AI and little variety during firefights, it stays fun and engaging, and although it doesn't revolutionize the genre, it's an excellent choice for those who like over-the-top humour and original ideas and want to spend about 12 hours of fun.","High on Life transports us to a bizarre, strange and hilarious universe in which humanity's only hope is a rookie bounty hunter, a gun that won't shut up and old glory. The art style, constant jokes, and loads of references make High on Life a good way to spend the 10-11 hour or so of the main adventure. Although there are aspects that could have been improved or options that should be present, the set leaves a great title, in which the variety of enemies, the character improvements and the story of High on Life itself, are close to achieving the outstanding.",,,"High On Life is easily Squanch Games’ most ambitious project, but aside from the environments and the world-building which match that ambition, the first-person shooter itself is incredibly generic, and not funny enough to make up for it.",,"High on Life is one of those games that punches hard with style and character. Once you’ve started playing, you won’t be able to stop. Perhaps some people may find the humor a little much at times, but I had a blast.",,"High On Life is absolutely fantastic, and you should play it.","High on Life is an FPS that focuses on making us laugh while enjoying the combat. The game manages to make us laugh in many of the conversations, with that Rick & Morty humor that Justin Roiland is known for. Could have had a little more depth to the gameplay, which makes it lame in this area.","Anyone who isn’t thrilled at the idea of having Roiland constantly chattering in their ear for a dozen hours straight will likely find the game’s incessant need to force itself on the player annoying. With the addition of uncompelling combat, frustrating exploration, and a lack of anything else to offer players, High on Life is one of the most annoying, derivative, and slogging experiences in years.","It’s a solid shooter that often manages to nail its jokes, has a unique visual style, and feels pretty great to control the further into the campaign you get. It isn’t going to be the best shooter of all time, but it’s certainly fun while it lasts, and worth checking out.",,,,,,,"A bit confusing at first, High On Life is an experience that can finally be enjoyed once you put some hours into it. Regarding its purely FPS component, even though it works very well, it was a bit too wishy-washy. Among the notable flaws, we have the lack of impact in gunfights, a small and repetitive bestiary and bosses that are too easy to take down. On the other hand, the idea of the Gatlians is interesting to explore and this irreverent, vulgar, trashy and absurd humour finally won us over and made us forget some of the game design’s shortcomings. Beware, however, that the lack of ergonomics, particularly with regard to subtitles, could put off many non-English-speaking players from getting involved in the adventure. Although imperfect, Squanch Games’ title remains a solid base for a new licence and manages to take us into its totally ludicrous universe despite quite a negative first impression. Well done!","High on Life has a particular vibe, one that rewards patient exploration and persistence. The dialogue is a lot to handle, yes. And not every weapon is a winner. The wrong Gatlian can leave you both overwhelmed and unimpressed. But the look, the sound of this game is truly remarkable. This is an alien world that’s crammed full of curious details. The visuals are delicious, the soundtrack is mostly bangers, and the boss fights are well-crafted. Whatever problems I had with the pacing were (mostly) wiped away by that final challenge. It turns out a little spectacle goes a long way. If you can handle Justin Roiland’s unique sense of humor, you’ll want to check out High on Life.",,,,,,"High on Life can be extremely annoying to some and extremely fun to others, as there is sarcasm in almost every minute of the game about religion, superstition, politics, daily routines, and even colors. If you are a Justin Roiland fan, there is no doubt that High on Life will be one the best adventures of your life.",,"High on life isn't here to change your game of the year or to make history. It knows is place as a great send off to a great year and does this job phenomenally. While it's fun combat lacks the diversity the rest of the game has, the humor, fantastic level design and surprisingly good plot will make you leave with a big smile.","High on Life is an enjoyable yet silly first person shooter that works on most levels. While the humour sometimes misses he target, for the most part it is quite a witty and humouress story with interesting protagonists and antagonists to be found along the way as you explore this immersive alien shooter. Definitely a game for those looking for something unique yet different in the first person shooter genre.",,,,,,,"High on Life is an irreverent, absurd shooter that manages to shine with its outrageous humor, silly setting and story, and some really goofy, foul-mouthed guns that pull the whole thing together for the vast majority of the time. Combat is a bit sloppy, especially during the first act, and the whole sci-fi adventure sometimes has an unpolished feel to it, but once you get some new tools of destruction and movement options, it rises to the occasion. Not all of its jokes find their punchline, but with memorable boss fights, unique alt-fire abilities and exploration, and way more terrible movies to watch than I expected, this wacky journey is definitely worth your time.",,,,,,"A fun FPS that gets better with every new talking gun you get. The wild situations, constant banter and sense of humor can either be great or a bummer, depending on your tastes. But if you like Rick & Morty, you're going to love it.","Graphically, High on Life is perhaps the least impressive that came out this year and in terms of gameplay, it's about as original and innovative as Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath, released in 2005. But this game holds its own because everything is soaked in Roiland's absurd humour, from the tutorial to the weapons and details. It's amazing how many interchangeable, goo-covered enemies you can shoot as long as an annoying space creature circles around your head and whines about its mother in a squeaky voice.",,,,"A game written and directed by one of the creators of Rick and Morty could have been a masterpiece, instead turned out to be an interesting and hilarious product only in parts. The gameplay holds up for a few hours but in the long run becomes quite repetitive, fortunately the dark humor that characterizes the entire production manages to lift it up in no small part.","Despite multiple shortcomings and my general aversion to the game’s writing, High on Life has occasional glimmers of potential. I’d like to see a sequel polish and improve upon this foundation. I’m always itching for more creative takes on shooters, but High on Life is a reminder that “different” doesn’t always mean “good.”",,"High On Life is an ambitious shooter, supported by a brilliant script that manages to make you laugh from start to finish. Unfortunately, the shooting phases struggle to excel and the game clearly suffers from all the limitations typical of independent development.","High On Life is the most video game-like video game to come from the minds of Squanch and Justin Roiland to date, and it shows the studio is capable of more than just lightly-interactive experiences packed with fart and cum jokes. Though it has plenty of those, too.",,"High on Life is a game that keeps its promises. Underneath a skin made up of over the top humor there is a biting irony towards a genre (old school FPS’s) which has far too many tropes to make fun of (and here not even one is left behind). The sometimes chaotic level design, combined with not exactly exciting boss fights, risks overshadowing the merits of the Squanch Games game, but a good sum of game mechanics manages to keep everything afloat, waiting for the next joke and the resulting laugh.","Despite having a number of fun and interesting ideas, High on Life falls short of its full potential. The new game from the co-creator of Rick and Morty will give you a good time, but only that.","Despite being often repetitive, High On Life manages to impress with off-the-wall humor from the creator of Rick and Morty.",,"It can be hard to separate what is ironically bad and what is just, well, bad.

You have to pace it right and you shouldn’t overdo it. Justin Roiland and co. unfortunately throw it at you in mindless spades and hope something sticks. And underneath it all? Just a very average shooter.,,,,"High on Life is a strong enough game with some fun gameplay segments and okay-ish plot, all of which can outweigh some of the obvious shortcomings. Basically this new release from Squanch Games is a competently made FPS with some szechuan sauce on the side.",,,,High On Life is a Comedy FPS that hits its target with its writing but not so much with its shooting. Too bad there's no localised version because it's really funny.,,,,,,,,,,"I had a good time with High on Life, but I can’t promise that everyone else will. Although the basic first-person shooter gameplay is hardly a revolution in game design, its certainly more than competent and accomplishes what it needs to, even with its significant lack of variety in the game’s second half. Where High on Life is likely to be polarising is its dialogue and humour, which are prevalent enough that they are hard to ignore. If you’re looking for a decent FPS that doesn’t overstay its welcome and can accept that not every joke is likely to land, then High on Life is certainly worth checking out.",,,,,"I appreciate what Squanch Games is doing in the industry as a whole, but Trover Saves the Universe was a much better distillation of Roiland and company's humor in a sounder package.","High On Life unapologetically caters to advent fans of absurdist comedy, which overflows with expletive language and wacky scenarios. Lack of enemy variety and performance issues may be a deterrent for some, however.",,,,"Technically proficient and lovely to look at, High on Life commits the cardinal sin of making the shooting part of the game feel underwhelming. A forgettable experience flecked with mediocre jokes.",,,"I’m a huge fan of the Oddworld-ian creature design and the factory-farming satire of its plot. But Oddworld made that stuff work because it had a big, weird heart. High on Life just has dilated pupils and a shit-eating grin.","High on Life is a fantastic experience hindered by some technical shortcomings. The world and characters are simply fantastic and it is genuinely hilarious, which is one of the hardest things in gaming to achieve. This game shot up my list of the best of 2022 from the outset and it didn’t disappoint by the end. I really enjoyed my time with it and look forward to what the team works on next. The fact that it is available on Game Pass is just icing on the cake. I can’t recommend this game enough, it is a wonderful way to end the year and more than worth playing through.",,,,,A miserable cocktail of ideas from other action-platformers and the worst parts of Rick and Morty. [Eurogamer AVOID],"This is quintessential Roiland humor: Drag out something for so long it starts to make the viewer uncomfortable, then drag it out a little longer until they start to uncomfortably laugh, then drive that laughter home with a dash more discomfort—see, now it’s hilarious. But whereas this formula works (mostly) well in a 22-minute-long Rick and Morty episode, by the time I’m several hours into High On Life, every line of dialogue makes it clear that somehow, I am not high enough.",,"My only major complaint lies in the abrupt ending, with no particular surprises after defeating the final boss or activities to finish. For a game that was filled with voices of the nattering guns, they are strangely silent once we laid waste to the big bad. It was odd and jarring. But, regardless, the destination was enjoyable and is very much worth your time if you enjoy a beautiful-looking, solid shooter that does not take itself at all seriously, with incredible performances from... well, talking guns, horny teddy bears, limbless bounty hunters, and fascist ant people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you are looking for a game that will make you laugh, High On Life is the one. It's a bare bones FPS with acid humor, brilliant characters, and it's filled with absurd situations; it will make you feel inside an Adult Swim series. However, its limited exploration and rhythm, the game is better committed to making you laugh rather than shoot.",,,,"An unsatisfying shooter brought even lower by an exhausting and all-encompassing script, High on Life can’t commit to its satire or ideas long enough to do anything of value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The most fun I had with High on Life was watching the entirety of Tammy and the T-Rex on an in-game television, and that’s not a compliment. It’s indicative of a game that doesn’t know how to exploit the interactivity of videogames and settles instead on yelling ideas as unsubtly as possible. With its relentless avalanche of jokes and screeches, it’ll talk your ears off but has exactly zero bite to go with its cacophonous barking. Its best ideas are borrowed from elsewhere. Its worst ideas are borrowed from elsewhere. The aggressively layered comedy is a smokescreen for the fact it's got nothing else going for it. It’s a clamorous joke delivery vehicle in which your role as a player is to passively observe and occasionally shoot stuff. You might as well sit down and watch TV.",,,,,,,,,"Even though I had zero expectations and was ready to be disappointed, I can easily say that High On Life turned out to be a very satisfying game, If you want to play an FPS which is dipped in some meta humor sauce and gameplay inspired by Metroid Prime and similar games High On Life is exactly what you are looking for. Of course if it's humor suits you, otherwise you may lower the score by a point or two.",,,,,,,
loot-river,"I normally tend to steer away from Souls-like as it’s not my genre of choice. Coupled with being a roguelike, I thought I wasn’t going to enjoy it in the slightest bit. Loot River surprised me though with its interesting and unique puzzle mechanics, and while not perfect by any means, “Souls Meets Tetris” is something I never thought I would write, but here we are. Factor in that Loot River is also currently available on Game Pass and it’s a hard title to pass up trying to see if it click with your genre preferences.",,,,"It feels like Loot River has difficulty in committing to the type of game it wants to be. For a roguelike, the runs feel too short, with too much blocked off. For a roguelite, the run-to-run progression is too lacking to be engaging.",,,,,,,,"Loot River combines attractive looks and sounds to roguelike mechanics with Tetris contaminations, giving life to a definitely original gameplay loop. It suffers from some repetitiveness and a not too deep combat system, but it remains capable of fascinating the player thanks to its unique mechanics.",,,,,,,"Action, roguelike, shifting levels, environmental puzzles “a la Tetris” and simple but clever combat mechanics.

shredders,,,,"Shredders is an ideal Xbox Game Pass game. It's a game most players will get a few hours of enjoyment from, complete the missions and grab some achievements, and then move on. The dedicated fans will keep coming back for the fluid and rewarding gameplay, and maybe to get perfect scores on all those missions. If you go into it expecting a big-budget rival to the likes of SSX and Amped, you might be disappointed with what you find, but taken at face value, Shredders is a fun time and a worthy addition to the sports library on Game Pass.","Shredders does everything in its power to make you feel cool, it pays homage to the glorious sport of snowboarding and does wonders to try and welcome newcomers as well.",,,"Shredders has a lot of potential and can be fun, but it needed a few extra months of development to improve some key aspects and fix some annoying bugs.","Shredders is a breath of chilly mountain air in the face of snowboarding fans everywhere. If you miss the genre's heyday of Cool Boarders, 1080 Snowboarding, and Amped, then it's definitely time to strap on a new pair of digital bindings.","Shredders is a fun, straightforward dive into the world of snowboarding, with mostly great controls and movements, and plenty of real-world influences. Some rough edges and often poor performance are all that hold this title back.",,,"Shredders is an ambitious indie game, characterized by some too many edges but with the great quality of offering a snowboarding game that conveys passion for this discipline. The extremely complex control system can lead to some frustration, but those who have the patience to overcome a few too many failures will be rewarded with satisfaction and a lot of fun.","Shredders is a game designed for snowboarding lovers, which includes good and fun mechanics to carry out the tests. Unfortunately, it falls short on everything else, causing you to lose interest very quickly.",,,,"Shredders is quite successful, and will easily appeal to fans of sliding and demanding gameplay.","Shredders is a beautiful snowboarding simulation title. Take to the mountain, wow the crowd, and get an invite to the kick-ass event. Fantastic solo, but better with friends! Pull off some gnarly tricks and be one with the snowy wilderness.","Shredders is a love letter to snowboarding, full of desire to entertain... but fails to excite because of some balancing issues and lack of content.","Technically, the game does look the part, with solid graphics especially on Xbox Series X where the game was tested, albeit there’s noticeable and rather annoying framerate drops whenever the game loads new players into our session. In the end, I find myself having a good time with Shredders, but there’s still plenty to iron out in its design before it has the chance to be remembered as one of the great snowboarding titles.",,,,"There’s still room for a big snowboarding game in today’s video game landscape, but Shredders isn’t able to fill it. While it looks nice when you’re not moving, issues with performance, controls, mission design, voice acting, story, nearly every aspect of this game is flawed. So value your time and wait for the next title in the genre.",,,,,,"In terms of sensations felt when sliding, the number of missions, the humour, and the soundtrack, FoamPunch really is a great game. But the problems linked to clipping, framerate drops and collisions kind of taint our general enjoyment of it. The realistic physics of our rider during tricks truly is astounding and it forces us to be fully aware of the timing feature to perform one trick after another. An update is necessary to turn this game from something decent to something remarkable.",,,,,"Needlessly complex controls dragging down a robust system, a storyline uninterested in upping the ante to wacky hijinks or otherwise, and a world that fails to acknowledge your existence, Shredders performs self-sabotage by seemingly not performing at all.",,,,,"Shredders snowboards its way onto the Xbox Series X that while it limits the replay value with some control inconsistencies and graphically errors, it still delivers an enjoyable time.","Shredders has its fair share of good intentions; it is meant to be a love-letter to an exciting sport such as snowboard, but in the end it does not manage to excite the player, the main reason being its lack of virtues. It is a fun game... but also a very simple and monotonous one. Unfortunately, it does not manage to shine much within its own genre.","I’m not an avid snowboarder by any means, but I’ve found Shredders to be a delight, a quick and rewarding, pick-up-and-play title that I can jump into for some quick runs after bashing my head against Elden Ring for far too long. It’s full of fun, humour and generally a delight to play.",,"Shredders is admirable for its ambiguous concept within the confines of an indie budget, but its gameplay doesn’t warrant any repeated trips to the slopes. Foampunch tries to salvage the game with an attempt to charm players with its wacky humor and splashes of energy, butting heads with the game’s juxtaposition of a dull open-world in the process. Curiosity may pique your interest in Shredders as it launches on Xbox Game Pass, but you’ll likely have forgotten the game within a few minutes of your descent from the summit.","I ended up feeling the same way about Shredders in comparison to SSX as I do with Tony Hawk and Skate. I prefer the fast-paced arcade action of the former, but the latter is a great time as well. I’d love to see the core gameplay and vibe of Shredders with a little more budget put into it, as there’s something special hidden underneath all the snow.",,,,,"Shredders is not as challenging as I was expecting, and whilst this limits its overall longevity, it's accessible, laid back and fun to play.",,,,,,,A snowboarding title for enthusiasts: this is Shredders.,"Shredders is a peculiar work full of contradictions. If its narrative, crazy, hilarious and embellished by the participation of some snow stars is as fresh as snow, his good gameplay (inspired by Steep) must clash with a disastrous technical performance. Still a game worth trying, especially on Game Pass.",,,"Made ""by riders for riders"", Shredders could be the Skate of snowboarding games. Its technical and more grounded approach to this sport makes it an original and interesting take.",,,,,"Despite being fun, Shredders feels like an ""introduction"" to a bigger game that never comes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Shredders is an enjoyable game if you temper your expectations. The campaign is quite good and comes in at just the right length while also providing some incentive to return and complete all of the challenges for each mission. Free roam mode is fine if you can forgive some of the performance hitches and inability to do much with others in a structured setting. The controls are good, but you'll lament the game momentarily forgetting about its momentum system. The relaxed feeling of snowboarding without restrictions makes things enjoyable. It makes for a perfect game for Xbox Game Pass and a decent purchase for those starved for a purely snowboarding-focused game.",,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’re a snowboarding fan, there’s a good chance you’ll get some hours of quality entertainment out of Shredders, especially if you manage to master its trick system. That’s a pretty big if though, as there’s some frustration involved. Still, available at a budget price, and included in Game Pass, it’s a decent new addition to a genre that’s pretty underrepresented these days, and with a low barrier to entry. It’s just a shame it isn’t a little more polished, and welcoming.",,,,,"While Shredders is definitely a great homage to snowboarding, it feels restrained and I can’t decide if it’s the budget, the developers, or the lack of length in missions that are what’s holding it back from entering into truly great territory. The incredibly beautiful snowfields help this world come to life. And while the characters can look a little generic, the voice work from professional snowboarders does help make up for this (sometimes). The developers at FoamPunch have delivered an open world with intuitive controls and a killer soundtrack that will make you want to keep coming back. Shredders is undoubtedly a solid snowboarding simulation. Hopefully the next attempt can clean up the pain points to deliver the whole package.",,,,,,,"Shredders may not be the most graphically impressive game, but the small developer studio FoamPunch manages to do what they set out to accomplish. Shredders is a worthy successor to titles like Amped and brings the accessible but deep controls of Skate to the snowboarding genre while focusing on what’s most important to the sport. The freedom and joy of finding your own path down a mountain through deep snow.",,,"With its grassroots indie charm, Shredders really owns its limitations. The game will resonate most with those tapped into contemporary snowboarding culture but can satisfy anyone who wants to lose themselves to moreish gameplay and a killer soundtrack. As an Xbox Game Pass title, it’s a day-one download, and well worth an evening’s play, even if you never touch it again. It’s not going to change the world but Shredders is an action-sports game that feels sensational to play – and that alone is no easy task.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Foam Punch hit that sweet spot between arcade and simulation, so snowboarding in Shredders feels really great.

An incoherent plot and a poor technical section, but spectacular combat and soundtrack.",,,"With some updates to the game's loot system and improvements to performance, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin has the potential to be a worthwhile action RPG for diehard Final Fantasy fans. However, there are just way too many things this game doesn't get right. It certainly isn't one of the best RPGs on Xbox, but if you have a few dedicated friends willing to endure this adventure via online co-op, you can undoubtedly share in a few great laughs. Still, I can't recommend Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin for anyone interested in a serious Final Fantasy story.",,,"Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin feels like a wasted opportunity, with an intriguing base idea but a lackluster plot, bad characterization and a disappointing technical production. It's partly saved by a satisfying - although not original - gameplay and a surprising ending.","Long story short, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origins feels like a game from two generations ago. Even if sometimes it could be perceived as a positive thing, it isn't when it means really poor graphics and an empty and bothersome story. Still, its combat system offers a fun and fresh experience, which will satisfy fans from the action genre. The question is if you'll be able to forgive its many, many flaws in favor of its fun gameplay.",,,,"Thanks to the variety of jobs offered and the customization of his hero, the player can easily renew his way of playing to never get bored.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"At first, the solid and engaging gameplay of Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin pushes us to invest ourselves. But very quickly, some unacceptable flaws appear, marred by multiple (marketing?) elements stifling the initial interest. Between a souls-like aspect that is clearly ill fitted to the gameplay, a bad staging, a narration cruelly lacking clarity and protagonists deprived of charisma and appeal, it ultimately becomes very difficult for a fan of the licence to be satisfied. On the other hand, if you focus solely on the gameplay and take this Final Fantasy simply for what it is, i.e. a rather unsound action-RPG, then you can find some satisfaction by playing it with friends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"True to its name, Stranger of Paradise is a bizarre game. The combat is so much fun that it carries the rest of the disjointed process to the finish line. Those looking for an easier Soulslike experience with a lot of Final Fantasy fanservice will find a lot to love in Stranger of Paradise, as will those who found Elden Ring unnecessarily punishing. Stranger of Paradise is a lot of fun, so long as the player takes on Jack's mindset, and only focuses on killing Chaos and doesn't think too hard about anything else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
saints-row,,"Saints Row is a new take on the franchise, one that focuses heavily on the RPG aspect of the game. It’s a fun underdog story set in the beautiful Saint Elos about this new version of the Saints. The customization options to make your boss truly your own delivers in such a remarkable fashion. However, it is the number of glitches and bugs that hurt the game’s reputation.","Saints Row pairs a great open-world city and respectable gameplay fundamentals with repetitive, dated mission design, a story that never finds its footing, and too many bugs to count. Depending on what you prioritize in a game, you may get some enjoyment out of it, but at best you’re looking at a diamond in a whole lot of rough.","Saints Row is one of the worst urban open world games we've played in recent memory, a bland, janky, old-fashioned mess of a game that fails to deliver on the promise held by a reboot of this zany franchise. Whether it's the buggy combat, boring missions, cringe-inducing dialogue or cookie-cutter side activities, there's always something to feel let down by here. If you're a huge fan of the genre you may well still find something to pass the time in Santa Ileso, there's decent character customisation, a strong soundtrack and plenty of baddies to kill and cars to wreck, but for everyone else this is one game that's virtually impossible to recommend and one of the biggest let-downs of 2022 so far.","Which gang you fall into will be completely up to you. For us, we’ve always been on the side of the Third Street Saints and with the rebooted Saints Row, will continue to do so.","Saints Row is one of these reboot cases that fails to build upon the legacy of the previous games in the series. While it does bare the essence of the series, it utterly fails in other domains. The new adventure in the Saints Row universe is plagued by gamebreaking and other bugs, heavy repetition in exploration missions and character models, and feels bland and tasteless. Players looking for customisation options can find loads of features that can keep them happy; ultimately, though, they are not enough to guarantee an exciting time in Santo Ilesso.","Saints Row is back, now The Saints will try to conquer Santo Ileso and the hearts of old fans of the saga and newcomers alike. Can it accomplish its goal? Its positive qualities make it highly possible.",,,"Saints Row (2022) succeeds at returning to the roots of its predecessors by paring back the outlandish absurdity without losing an ounce of chaos, but sometimes feels as if it's holding on too tightly to a past best left forgotten. Plus, it has a distinct lack of polish.",,,"Saints Row is not the reboot the series needed, significantly limiting the levels of insanity and comedy that are the hallmark of the series, while maintaining a gameplay that is now dated and in need of a serious makeover. This made it a decent but soulless title, definitely forgettable in today's landscape. If you're looking for a not-too-demanding open world it can still wring a few laughs out of you, but at the moment Saints Row smacks too much of a wasted opportunity. The series has great potential, but it needs a real leap forward if it is to have a future.","Saints Row is fun, enjoyable experience to play, but in therms of innovation, Volition should have gone further, bringing new things to the Saints Row franchise. Even with that in mind, the game is a must-have for those fans who have been waiting to play another Saints Row game.","Saints Row doesn't try to reinvent the wheel, but it doesn't need to — it's a solid open-world adventure with loads going on, and one that is really only a good helping of polish away from sitting among the genre's better games.",,"As a new start for the eponymous gang, Saints Row ticks most of the boxes, but falls short in offering up anything fresh. A litany of technical and visual bugs also conspire to spoil the party, making for a solid enough, enjoyable, but ultimately uninspired, return for the series.","Saints Row is not really what we can call a total reboot of the saga, but rather a soft-reboot: it is very similar to Saints Row The Third which, even if appreciated, is nonetheless ten years old. In fact, this is felt and this new adventure is still struggling to impose itself through its technique, its gameplay or its creativity which remain anchored in a certain immobility despite some novelties: it is however a game of effective action that never takes itself seriously, rather funny and with damn generous content, which we can never blame him for. Volition finally delivers Saints Row 3 with far-west sauce, which remains appreciable without breaking three pieces of dough for a gunslinger.","Saints Row is a franchise that has its best days behind it. Consequently, the latest iteration is dull, dated, and lacking oomph. The open world is great, as are the side hustles. However, this doesn't make up for its many shortcomings. Fans of the franchise may overlook the tedium, but I could not.",,"Saints Row is a big, over-the-top, extremely fun game and if they can sort out the bugginess quickly it’s an easy one to recommend.",,"While there are definitely elements of Saints Row that really annoyed me, I still generally had a good time with the game. It is great to have a game that is a complete package on launch with no microtransactions or exploitative monetization. If you consider yourself a Saints Row fan you’ll probably find plenty to enjoy in the newest entry, even if some of its elements are weaker than others.",,,,,,,,"Whether on foot or behind the wheel, the developers of Volition’s reboot offer us a wickedly fun title where one can take a perverse delight in making everything explode around them. The new characters are endearing and make us forget the old ones. Despite some successful quest sequences, the scenario remains too short. From secondary activities to the extensive customisation of the protagonist, weapons and vehicles, the game’s content is quite rich. This Saints Row is a pleasant and entertaining game to blow off some steam, but ultimately, it sticks to its guns and does not take enough risks to really set itself as a master of the genre.",,,,,"A fantastic addition to the Saints Row catalogue, though it’s marred by a bunch of glitches and bugs that keep it just shy of excellence.",,,,"Saints Row is the perfect solution for those who seek to scratch that GTA 6 itch. The plot is extremely enjoyable and brings the series back to its roots just as i hoped it would, mixed with supreme cutscenes filled with action and energy. And speaking of action, as much as i like shoving grenades down someone's pants and tossing them to a group of enemies, the combat system just feels like it fits to a game released a decade ago. Overall, the game is a lot of fun, and that is all that matters.",,,"Saints Row finds a better tone than its predecessor, but otherwise doesn’t deliver as a reboot, with gameplay and mission structures inferior to past instalments. With the right expectations, there’s still fun to be had, but the endless bugs, glitches and just awful AI make it hard to recommend at launch.",,,"For all my issues with Saints Row, I keep telling myself 'at least it's fun, and the reason people play these games is not for the characters, or the story, or the weak social viewpoint the game puts forward, but the fun'. It's become a mantra. Like a little train going up a mountain: At least it's fun. at least it's fun, at least it's fun. The further I got through the game, the less I felt that was true.",,,,,,,,,"Saints Row does a lot of good in terms of personalization, clunky action and stupid physics, and is therefore somehow also a successful reboot that offers hope for the future of the franchise. Unfortunately, the game is held back by mediocre open world activities, a mediocre story and a laundry list of bugs.",,,"The Saints Row reboot offers a fun experience, made even more varied by the numerous Criminal Enterprises and capable of bestowing smiles, given the presence of crazy weapons to discover and out of the ordinary Skills. In addition to the journey of brotherhood at the base of the story, the real element that pushes to extend the stay in Santo Ileso is the boundless customization, which will allow you to have the last word on the look of characters, weapons, cars and the Saints HQ. Anchored in some ways to stylistic features of the past, the latest Volition effort is affected by some critical issues both on the playful and purely graphic front and more generally fails to make the series reach new evolutionary peaks. That said, if you're a lover of chaos and easygoing, manageable criminal travels, get ready to end the summer with a bang.",,"It may not push your new hardware to the limit and is a little rough around the edges, but the latest Saints Row is everything it needs to be, delivering a wonderful comedic experience with plenty of depth. While a little irritating, I was never bored and wanted to see where my team’s goofy antics would take them next. The payoffs are often worth the time investment, and just veering off the beaten path pays dividends. I’m glad the Saints are back, hopefully for another long haul.",,,"The new Saints Row doesn’t break any new ground, however it's still a relatively fun time. If you’re a fan of the series, there’s no reason not to give this one a spin.",,,,,,,,,,Not a successful restart: The Saints Row reboot isn't really convincing either in terms of play or technology.,,,,,,,,,,"Even if one doesn't experience these technical issues, though, Saints Row is still a disappointment. The mission variety, co-op, and criminal ventures are great, but the game feels like it's at least a console generation behind in every other category. It's not the worst Saints Row game, but it's also far from the best games in the series, and will likely leave most fans of the franchise unimpressed.",,,"Ultimately the new Saints Row is a disappointment, especially if you’re a fan of the series. The co-op mode, although highly problematic when trying to establish a game, was commendably solid once up and running, and fun for a while. The new location and characters don’t really land and the sloppy nature of just about every aspect gives the impression of yet another game released long before it was finished. And even though this might sound like a random aside, when a Saints Row game with multiple radio stations features only a handful of memorable or recognisable tracks - to the point where you don’t even notice driving around in silence - you know there are issues.","In short, Saints Row is a very good game. It’s got highs and lows, with some flaws hopefully set to be patched out by its release date. While it may not blow players away, it’s an enjoyable open-world title with lots to do. Side characters are charming, there are plenty of funny moments, and it’s a perfect game for simply messing around in.","A brand new version of Saints Row, without most of the problematic humor. Well within the standards of modern open world, but doing so, the game content remains far too old school to impress.",,,"The new Saints Row stumbles when it comes to bringing its world to life, which is a shame, as the story of the new Saints would have benefited from a much better sandbox for them to play in.",,,,,,,"Saints Row successfully reboots the much-loved franchise, although things don’t feel as wild or chaotic as I was expecting or hoping. The main campaign is a short but enjoyable romp with some decent creativity, but the open world template doesn’t innovate beyond the trappings of the genre. Side missions and distractions are amusing yet repetitive, and the adventure is lacking in polish overall. Still, being able to play the entire experience with a mate by your side makes for a lot of laughs, and if you can forgive the cringe dialogue, there are some fun moments between all the meandering that still makes it worthwhile. I can’t say that the Saints are “back and better than ever”, but gearing up for a modest romp with a lot of explosions and strong personalisation will certainly set them up for a roaring sequel if given the chance.",,,,"However, the bugs should certainly not remain unnamed and it stands in the way of an even higher final score. Saints Row really does a lot of good and Volition successfully uses the reboot to bring the best of Saints Row to the fore, namely building your own crime organization. The result is a game that is perhaps even closer to classics such as Vice City and San Andreas in terms of ambiance and structure than its successors, but in terms of finish it just doesn't come close to those games. Saints Row will also not go down in the history books as a classic, but there is no doubt that there is a lot of fun to be had with the game.","I didn't really know how I felt about Saints Row until I hit the open world segment, and this current team showed me what it is capable of.",,,,,"Saints Row is a decent action game plagued by bugs, but offers a unique proposition: it’s an open-world game that you might actually be able to finish. It’s unlikely to be a GOTY contender, but Saints Row is a good opener for release season and often you’ll be having a blast.",,,"While Saints Row is messy, buggy, silly and often derivative, it also recalls a time in the early 2000s when the open world genre was a haphazard, joyful space with none of the codified, dopamine-fracking precision of modern titles. There are, in this frisky reboot, the ghosts of titles such as True Crime: Streets of LA, State of Emergency, The Getaway and Runabout – patchy, imperfect but gripping experiments in player agency that didn’t quite understand the conventions, but had a bash anyway. To me that is a far more interesting set of stablemates than the last couple of Saints Row titles. To me, this is a preposterously fun video game, despite its many faults, or more accurately, because of them.","I am extremely sad at this reboot of Saints Row, while I wasn’t a huge fan of the absolute bonkers nature of the 4th entry, even if I did love the 3rd. With this reboot I feel like Volition missed a huge opportunity evolve this series for a new generation, not just of consoles but for gamers. As it stands, this game comes off just feeling like its clinging to the tone and design choices from the 360; even the graphics in this reboot from 2022 feel dated and frankly Johnny Gat deserves better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Saints Row is ultimately an underwhelming missed opportunity. It's a shame, as this was a chance to do something big, bold and different – showing us where the franchise could be heading in the years to come. But instead, the end product is a basic and fairly tedious experience that is stuck in an era of gaming long past. There are a handful of fun moments, but these are fleeting and it's difficult to suggest anyone picking the game up.",,,,,,,,,,,"The Saints Row reboot wants to tell a new, modern story, but the gameplay framework surrounding it is starting to show a bit of rust.",,,,,"If 2022’s Saints Row had been an open-world game with fewer pawns on the board when it comes to enemy factions, a bit more time to bake in the development oven to iron out the assorted bugs and issues, and a story that doesn’t end up feeling forced and confused in regards to who it’s for, it would have ended up being far more likeable and worth recommending.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite all its flaws (and there are more than a few), Saints Row is undoubtedly fun and explosive in its over-the-top presentation. While its punctuated with memorable moments, they are often diminished by the repetitive nature of its side content, which makes up a significant portion of what Saints Row has to offer. If you’ve been a longtime fan of the series’s previous entries, you will find plenty to enjoy with this latest installment – just don’t expect much in the way of innovation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
resident-evil-village-winters-expansion,,,,,,,,,,"Resident Evil Village: Shadows of Rose provides yet another compelling excuse to return to the gorgeous locations from the base game. With a tangible sense of heart and meaningful character development, this campaign expansion establishes Rose as a standout figure in the world of Resident Evil. This delicate story of growth and self-identification is viciously contrasted by psychological horror visuals that will unquestionably haunt players for quite some time.",,,,,,,,"Despite one, maybe two, well-functioning Horror item(s) and Rose's powers adding a new way to progress, this DLC is only of interest to players who enjoyed the main title. A story with rose water that we would have liked much tastier...","Winters' Expansion is a great addition to the base game. With an interesting but short story option and the phenomenal arcade Mercenaries mode, there is something for everyone. Sadly, though, the third-person viewpoint created issues, and the atmosphere was impacted as a consequence. However, it is still a great purchase and is worthy of your money and time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There’s a good multiplayer game somewhere within Resident Evil Re:Verse, but what’s here now is in desperate need of balance changes and more content. This third-person deathmatch is an interesting take on the franchise’s most iconic locations and characters, and it has some good ideas – especially giving you a second life as a fan-favorite monster. That can be fun in short bursts, but nearly every match made me wince at its unbalanced roster, lack of variety, and monetization methods that make better perks more easily available to those willing to spend cash. Resident Evil Re:Verse will need to grow into a lot more than this if it wants to become something better than a novelty for completionist Resident Evil fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Winters Family saga has come to an end with Shadows of Rose, a DLC that is a sort of epilogue to Resident Evil Village. The new content is brilliant and gives to Village a full gameplay experience. It's a perfect third person game for all fans of the franchise and also for all those that are waiting for Resident Evil 4 remake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shadow of Rose is a neat package with a solid campaign as well as new features for the original game.

It was great revisiting the main game and the new content really fleshes out Rose’s role in this whole universe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Winters' Expansion ties up some loose ends, and allows you to revisit the game 16 years later. It's a short but fun romp back into the village. The Mercenaries addition is also really fun.

the-falconeer,"The Falconeer has some smaller issues, but those are easily overlooked when you take into account this was made by one person. The story is pretty interesting even though the missions aren’t, and the voice acting can be a little annoying at times. But exploring The Great Ursee for new locations, dogfighting with challenging opponents and discovering that thin line of balance between offense and defense is all very rewarding. I was expecting the game to be beautiful, but I wasn’t expecting the combat to be so challenging and deep. It was a wonderful surprise.",,,,"While the combat may not be super engaging, and the story is a bad egg, the gorgeous world of The Falconeer on Xbox is a triumph. Paired with the spectacular music and breathtaking feeling of flight, this game provides what feels like an exceptional concept rather than a complete game.",The sea world of The Falconeer is definitely easy on the eye and its aerial battles thrive in their arcadey simplicity. On the other hand the large difficulty spikes and the complete absence of checkpoints have a significant impact in the joy that someone can have from its simple yet effective gameplay.,,"The Falconeer is beautiful and quite enjoyable, but it gets repetitive. It’s a shame its gameplay is a bit flawed, since it can be fun and original.",,"The Falconeer is an undeniably beautiful game with unique storytelling and jaw-dropping environments, but repetition ultimately keeps it from being great.",,"The Falconeer is a small but surprisingly ambitious game that will impress those that are curious with its artistry, and if you are willing to pack a little extra patience and tolerance of its more glaring flaws, you’re likely to have a good time. Fans of old-school air-combat games such as Ace Combat and Crimson Skies in particular should consider giving it a shot.","The Falconeer delivers a solid and gratifying aerial combat experience withing an intriguing and mysterious world. While its RPG component feels underdeveloped and characters end up being too anonymous, it's definitely a game to try for lovers of the genre.","The Falconeer is a game with great ideas, but also with a mission system that ends up being repetitive and boring too soon. However, it is not a bad game. It offers a great quality in flight physique, and great visuals. In addition, it was made by a single person, which is undoubtedly a merit difficult to match, especially for the quality of many of its options. It is not a game for everyone, but for those who enjoy air combat games.","The world of The Great Ursee is dramatic and looks gorgeous with its pleasing sunset vistas that really pop thanks to the game’s brilliant use of HDR. However, The Falconeer does fly too close to the sun in some areas. A largely forgettable and at times confusing story will be a disappointment to some, while inconsistent collision detection and a lack of mission checkpoints create frequent disappointing turbulence. Faults aside, for a game that’s been created by one person, and is one of the cheaper Xbox Series X|S launch day titles, you should definitely consider picking up The Falconeer along with your new console.",,,,,,,,,"The controls are kind of wonky — as enjoyable as it is to soar, the birds here aren’t exactly the most agile things in the world, so you spend a lot of time banking around and coming in for a new pass, and doing that over and over again until you finally shoot down all your enemies. All of this is probably fine if you want to do is aerial combat for a couple of hours. The Falconeer really only does that one thing, so if it’s your thing, then you’re in luck. Don’t expect anything more than that, though, because there’s pretty much nothing else to do.",,,,The Falconeer brings to life a fantastic and beautiful open world where we can fly everywhere riding our giant falcon. Dogfights between the clouds while an interesting story between different factions is defining our actions. We just miss more interactions with the world around us and to be able to change the story with our decisions.,,,,,,,,"The Falconeer absolutely excels in story and presentation. Sure, its aerial combat gameplay might lack impact or variety, but with such an interesting and visually stunning world, it’s easy to overlook such shortcomings.",,,,,"The Falconer succeeds in its exploration which is wonderful, however its repetition and frustrating combat mechanics creates a whole new challenge for the gamer. Lastly, this new world will take most gamers around 10 to 12 hours to successfully complete and its creator Tomasa Sala should be commended on creating a brand new and engaging world with its own rich culture and dynamics. Interestingly to say the least!",,,,,"I don't hate The Falconeer. I don't even think it's a particularly terrible game. There are great ideas here, and in the aesthetic department, it's a resounding success. However, it just needs more. It needs more polish, more reason to keep playing, and more reliable controls to navigate its interesting setting in. I would love to revisit this world at some point, and I hope that the dev can find a way to keep me more engaged next time.",,,,,"The Falconeer is a beautiful game that offers a necessary freedom and escape that is much needed right now. It looks incredible, and flying around The Great Ursee feels excellent, but sometimes the combat can be tricky.",,,"The Falconeer is a beautiful indie game, full of promising ideas, but gets too repetitive after a couple of hours. There´s a great story behind the aerial combat, but it feels underdeveloped.",,,,,"The Falconeer is an interesting aerial combat game which, however, is weighed down by several burdens that do not allow it to shake off the monotony that arises from its own ambition as an open world.",,,Perhaps it would have been better to aim for something smaller and more manageable instead of engaging in the creation of a vast but empty world.,,,,,"The Falconeer is fascinating and compelling in many aspects, despite its repetitiveness.",,"The combat missions are where The Falconeer falters, the controls for quickturns and dives never as responsive as they need to be.

Nonetheless you can experience intense dogfights in a neatly presented water world.,,,"It’s not the most accessible game around, but this quirky bird-borne aerial combat game is definitely one of the most imaginative games in the Xbox Series X/S launch line-up.",,,,,"With a distinct art style, gorgeous animations, and intriguing lore, there's enough in The Falconeer to justify a playthrough, but most of its enjoyment doesn't shine through until the last couple of hours.","The Falconeer tries to fly so high from very early, but as the hours go by, its structure ends up holding back any hint of excellence and it is reduced to simplicity, which is a shame considering how interesting its planning is. The control is precise, the narrative context is rich and absorbing, but flying is not as satisfying as it could be, clouded by a mission design with repetitive and insistent patterns. The magic is short-lived, despite being a brief and enjoyable experience on the artistic level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Falconeer tries to be a legit dogfighting game and it plays the part to an extent; but there isn't much holding it all together. I feel like I've said this often in 2020, but I wouldn't mind seeing the developer take another crack at it, because there's a lot of good groundwork here.","The Falconeer has grand world building ambitions that never come to pass. Its narrative lacks a proper set-up, or a satisfying payoff, as the gameplay seems entirely disconnected. The poor control scheme, occasionally frustrating difficulty, and repetitive missions make for a forgettable launch game on Xbox Series X.",,"The Falconeer is a beautiful game with an intriguing setting that engaged me throughout my playtime, but the dogfighting disappoints and there’s just not much to it otherwise. It was created by a one-man studio so this is quite an accomplishment, but the fact remains that the final experience falls short of greatness.",,,,"Far more than the combat—whose charm ebbs away on a tide of repetition after the first few hours—the draw of The Falconeer is its suggestion that, while we may be shaped by our stories, they don’t pin us down, that the mere act of living is to take flight from the past.","It’s a satisfying experience as you glide gracefully over the ocean, but too often the dogfighting and bombing runs play out as erratic scrambles.",,,,,,"In a world of compromised visions, The Falconeer is dazzlingly original. An aerial combat game unlike any other. [Eurogamer Recommended]",,,,,,,"The Falconeer is an eye-catching experience and the controls are smooth and fluid; but when the hours and missions accumulate, repetition takes its toll on us and the game fails to break the basic pattern in its design and dogfighting.",,,,,,"The presentation package of The Falconeer is quite good, especially on XSX, but that alone couldn’t overcome the struggles I was having with the experience otherwise. I appreciate the effort that went into making this, especially seeing as it was practically done by a one-man studio — but neither the lore or the gameplay really grabbed me and held my interest for long. I could see where more adept and/or forgiving players in this genre would have a better time than I did, though, so if the game sounds interesting to you, it’s worth keeping an eye on, especially given it costs less than half of some of the other launch games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I want to love The Falconeer, and I do love it in a way, but I cannot recommend it. Despite the quality of its art style and the peacefulness that exudes when you fly over its endless ocean, it’s a tedious and plodding experience. Combat, which comprised the vast majority of the game’s runtime, is inaccurate and weightless, making all of your successes and failures feel arbitrary. And yet, the game makes you want to come back to it, as if by some ineffable witchcraft. I desperately wish this were a better game than it is, rather than an amazing looking game let down by its frustrating combat and boring sandbox experience.","The Falconeer starts off as a fun, original take on aerial combat but quickly turns into a boring exercise in repetition that even a mysterious and interesting world can’t save.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With all of the good, there ends up being just as much bad. It’s easy and hard to like this game. Having a mission that hinders your ability to progress the story because it’s entirely luck-based is also a real shame. If given a few tweaks, it could have really shined as an outstanding flight combat entry. The heaviness of the bad mechanics is too much to allow it to soar high.",,,,
martha-is-dead,,"However, slight technical issues aside I feel confident in saying that Martha is Dead is one of the best titles I’ve played this year. Its gameplay mechanics are simple but put to use effectively, but it’s the narrative, themes, and the way this is all tied together that really stand out. It’s gruesome, grim, and will be hard to stomach for some people, but if you’re up for a truly gripping and thrilling tale, then Martha is Dead is a must play.",,,"Martha is Dead is a brilliant era-based thriller. The headlines will focus on the sections that have been censored by Playstation, but that would be a shame because there is so much more to this game than those moments. Experience Martha is Dead and it will stay with you for some time to come.","Martha Is Dead is definitely an improvement over LKA’s previous game. Giulia’s fragile character provides an interesting protagonist and the story gripped us from the first minutes. Unfortunately, the last part of the game isn’t as strong and culminates in a somewhat predictable way.","Martha is Dead is one of those stories that will leave its mark on you. A few performance issues do hinder the experience a bit, but it's still a highly recommended game.",Martha is Dead is a solid choice for horror fans… as long as they’re happy with some disgusting moments.,"Martha is Dead wants to send a big important message, but the way it’s delivered is terrifyingly bad, not only in it’s writing but also in the shoddy gameplay.",,,Martha is Dead tells a deeply personal and complex story that strikes at some complex issues that are only held back from greatness due to technical struggles.,"Martha is Dead is unique. A rare pearl in the gaming landscape, dealing with tough issues and immerses us in a raw and real World War II Tuscany, painting a horror story that is truer than ever. It is not for everyone, and if you are overly emotional it is definitely not for you, but if you love authorial and story-driven games, it's absolutely recommended.","Martha is Dead is a walking simulator with touches of psychological horror that manages to turn its most controversial section into an element capable of enhancing what it intends to show, although there are times when it unnecessarily overdoes it. Although it has a somewhat clumsy gameplay and a deficient technical section, the story of Giulia is worth living.","Martha is Dead is a game that looks to throw you off balance at every turn, to seduce you with picturesque scenes before forcing you to witness Hell on earth. Aside from its 4K/30fps performance, Martha is Dead is a well-polished and appealing ride from start to finish, offering those looking for a dark thriller game filled with rich details an entertaining ride. Horror fans looking for an adrenaline rush, though, won't find anything here to sate their appetites, unfortunately, but some fairly gruesome scenes certainly lean into the psychological horror tropes, and never cheap out on the gory details.",,,LKA has created an initially very solid mystery that gradually sinks into incomparable morbidity and an unfortunately more dispersed conclusion.,"This game is not terrible, however, it is not fantastic. This genre has to have a strong story to be remembered due to the lack of action, thrills, and spills. Martha is Dead just lacks that spark to make it great. The ending of the game is fairly predictable, and it was not the most enjoyable journey to get there. Unfortunately, it falls short of its peers but is still worthy of your time.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Martha is Dead is a successful dive into the abyss of a family drama filled with mysteries. Within a historical context that is as interesting as it is gripping, its careful and controlled narrative easily keeps the audience on their toes.

The rest left me feeling as cold as Giulia’s dead sister.",,,"While I enjoyed a fraction of my time exploring Martha is Dead's gorgeous Tuscan farmlands, the thing I'm most thankful for is how mercifully short the game is. The closing credits shocked me back into coherence like a bolt out of the blue to cap off what is—and I'm being generous—an interestingly imperfect experience.",,"Martha is Dead is a complex first-person narrative adventure, a story of traumatic experiences that could upset the sensitivity of those who play. Anyway LKA depicted in a brilliant and compelling way the discomfort of the main character, even if sometimes narration lingers in the spectacularization of the most gory elements. The Italian studio did a great job creating an accurate historical stage, but technically the game has significant ups and dawns, which, anyway, don't undermine too much the overall experience.",,,,"This miserable wallow in the psyche of a traumatised young woman isn't so much horrifying, then, as simply unpleasant.

This is an intense journey while Giulia navigates through the topic of mental health, putting everything in perspective during an extremely heavy psychological drama. Martha Is Dead is not a game for those looking for a horror experience focused on jump scares, massacres or horror/spiritual activities; nor is it for those who want to see a finite outcome. Martha Is Dead requires an open mind, a strong stomach and a mighty power of reflection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The development team has to be applauded for pushing the boundary of the horror industry with its ideas.

It is a special game that takes risks and although not everything works out well, the end result is worth the experience. Its clearest flaws are the sparse checkpoints so you can end up replaying an entire act with all its frustrations. Also, its combat is clunky and unfair, and the tendency to overcomplicate certain things. In essence it is an Escape Room. But like no other you've ever played. Visually and sonically it is a masterpiece and has no flaws in this aspect. As a whole, it is striking, unique and represents something rarely seen in the video game industry.",,,"As far as horror games that ape the works of H.R.

gotham-knights,,"Overall Gotham Knights is a fantastic single-player game and an even better coop experience. Fans of the Arkham series will be right at home and inexperienced players will pick the gameplay up with very little difficulty. Beautiful skyscapes, brutal combos, and unreal levels of customizability put Gotham Knights right up there with some of the best Comic Book Video Games.","Gotham City might never have looked better, but Gotham Knights’ gameplay repetition and lack of length to the main narrative might deter all but the most hardcore Batman fans. Co-op adds a fun layer to all the crime fighting, and every character feels truly different from one another, even if the combat system takes some getting used to. Overall, there is a solid core here that hopefully can be built on in the future.","Gotham Knights is a dark, dense and surprisingly gripping action adventure that almost manages to step up to the level of the very best of the Arkham series. There's a cracking story to dive into here, a huge and wonderfully detailed city, tons of lore for Bat fans, brutally crunchy combat, four cool superheroes to get a handle on and some of Gotham's most infamous villains to take down as you fight to prevent an all-out turf war. We were slightly concerned going into this one but, as it turns out, we needn't have been. If you can ignore some messy menus and a few too many upgradeable bits and bobs, you'll have a great time.","Gotham Knights is the game that everyone wants to hate, but that shouldn't be the case as there is a lot to love here. It's a good open-world game that explores a brilliantly realised Gotham City, powered by some fun, fluid combat and a wicked world that is easily explorable. Hanging around the rooftops as you take in the main story, smaller incidents or even as you hunt secret challenges allows Gotham Knights to shine, even if the Batcycle sections don't feel particularly great.",,"Gotham Knights is a worthy heir to the Arkham saga, with a new approach and a starting point of a new universe. Good gameplay and a great story that takes place in the biggest Gotham yet, which is full of activities but it feels empty.",,,,,,"Gotham Knights has a lot of potential which, however, stays partly unexpressed: the fights suffer from a lower physicality compared to the previous Arkham titles and even the city traversal appears less convincing, while a graphics performance mode would have helped in the most frantic action scenes. It however remains a game capable of entertaining and highly recommended to fans of the Bat-family, mainly thanks to a good story that manages to keep us glued to the screen.","All in all, Gotham Knights has been a big disappointment. Every inch of this game is such a step back from Rocksteady's Batman Trilogy, without even giving anything valuable in exchange for it, that it is imposible to play it without leaving a sour taste in your mouth. If you are looking for a new coop game to play with some friends without thinking too much about it, or if you are really dying to play a new DC Comics game, then Gotham Knights might be what you are looking for. However, we advice to keep your expectations in check, because this game is more a Marvel's Avengers than a Batman: Arkham City.","Gotham Knights' situation as a game aptly reflects the struggle of its protagonists — the new team has big boots to fill now Bats is gone, and while they can't quite live up to his legacy, they still manage to make an impression by doing things their own way. Combat is decent once it opens up, and traversal and the overarching gameplay loop are both great, but it's a shame that Gotham Knights' performance leaves a lot to be desired. Much of New Game+ feels like you're building a character for an endgame that doesn't exist at this point, so I'm looking forward to seeing what the four-player Heroic Assaults are like when they arrive in November. I'll be combing Gotham for those last few collectables until then, and despite its technical issues, I must say that I was surprised how much I warmed to Gotham Knights after it failed to grab me initially.",,"You may spend a lot of your time comparing Gotham Knights to the Arkham series, and that's to be expected. But this is a different beast, and something to be relished on its own terms.","Gotham Knights, orphan of the iconic figure of Batman, takes up the torch with panache. Our heroes honor the Dark Knight for an exhilarating adventure inspired by comic books. The city of Gotham, darker than ever, the technical and nervous fights, and the complementarity of the four vigilantes blow a breath of super-heroic freshness on the universe of Batman. Without being perfect with its camera flaws and sometimes redundant missions, the Warner Games title hits hard and proves that Batman is not the only hero worthy of the name in Gotham.","I really wanted to love Gotham Knights, and mostly, I did. However, I can’t ignore its repetitive gameplay, awful vehicular control, and the inevitable complaints about the frame rate. Yet, this DC title is enjoyable. The combat is smooth and captivating; the villains are great, and the story flows nicely. What’s more, two-player cooperative action is the icing on the cake. Yes, it could be better, but hardcore fans won’t care.",,"In the end, either solo and especially in co-op, it’s an easy recommendation for me. All four heroes play fantastically and are quite different from one another. It also looks great on a Series X. I hope that Gotham Knights becomes a series because this is one hell of a first entry.",,,,"There are some truly fun moments in Gotham Knights. Playing with a friend highlights the very best of what the developers set out to do, and I enjoyed both the story and getting to see Gotham’s protectors outside of Batman grab the spotlight. If the developers had built Gotham Knights around its strengths, it could have been an easy recommendation. As is, you spend so much time in its bland open world that only those who plan to explore it with friends should seriously consider it.",,,,,,"Despite some wishy-washy fights and a somewhat empty open world, Gotham Knights is a title that honours the licence. Perfectly blending action gameplay and RPG mechanics, fans and other players will be delighted. Even if the 20 hours necessary to complete the adventure are not enough to satisfy our thirst for more content, the presence of numerous side activities will suffice in deceiving our need for more. The arrival of a more complete multiplayer mode on November 29, 2022 should also contribute to supplementing the initial offer.",,,,,,,,,,,,Those without a real attachment to the Bat family will feel indifferent to what's presented; most who adore Dick and Babs will simply be disappointed.,,,,,"Gotham Knights is a consistently disappointing return to Batman’s troubled city and a distinct step backwards from the past decade-plus of Batman games. Even if running around Gotham in two-player co-op can be decent fun and each of the four playable crime fighters are well executed in their dialogue and distinctive moves, too many of the fundamentals fall short for me to recommend it. From the inconsistent frame rates, to the weak story, to one-note combat that rarely feels good, there was virtually always something going wrong to make sure I wasn’t experiencing the triumphant return with my friends at my side I had envisioned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gotham Knights surprised us in a positive way: it's not a revolution for the genre, but it's able to entertain the fans of the DC Universe, especially because Batman's not here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gotham Knights is a lot of fun, and for someone looking to mindlessly beat criminals as a superhero, it's an easy recommendation. Yet, anyone interested in anything more than that is going to face a lot of disappointment with its story beats, gameplay elements, individual features, and many other elements.",,,"Even if it ran beautifully, Gotham Knights still feels pretty much unsalvageable. There’s a lot of game to be found in Gotham Knights, a lot of by-the-numbers repetition, and many meaningless tasks that make you think the project began as a live service game like Marvel’s Avengers. And simply shifted focus to become a co-op thing sometime during development. But then again, that’s adding justification to mechanics and progression systems in a game that doesn’t care to explain why you need to craft new gear all the time. There’s no “endgame” or persistent world to support the repetition either. The good news is that there’s quite a bit of story to dig into, and you do get to go head-to-head with several notable villains. But you’ll need to overcome a lot more than the death of Batman to see it through.","While it’s not without some mild downsides, Gotham Knights is an outstanding title that deserves a space in any Batman fan’s game collection, especially if you want to see his protogés get some deserved spotlight for a change.","An adventure that ends up being quite dull compared to the stakes involved. Relying on the (old) Creed formula, the title remains pleasant in hand and doubly pleasant in co-op.",,,,,,"Gotham Knights acts as more of a cautionary tale than the logical next step for this storied universe. For a long time no one knew how to make a compelling Batman game, and then we got four of them in seven years. Taking what worked before while seeking to evolve it is admirable, but the obsession over loot is ill-conceived, cynical, and tasteless. It feels as though volume of content is given precedence over meaningful content, and for those that might enjoy the grind, the endgame's absence will be noticeable.",,,,"Gotham Knights smartly puts focus on some iconic DC Villains and showcases a new threat with an interesting story full of conspiracies and secrets. It does a good job of establishing this story with underrated heroes, tying in fun action which is enhanced greatly by playing with a friend. Other elements, like boring diversions from the main story, a tacked-on crafting system, and an over-reliance on throwing piles of long, repetitive battles in your path towards the end are less successful, but I still enjoyed my time exploring Gotham City overall. Especially if you have a sidekick, this is a superhero adventure that is well worth suiting up for.",,,,,"After playing Gotham Knights, I couldn’t shake the feeling that a lot of it had the air of an Arkham-verse fan game. While there is something there, you can almost reach out and touch the design-by-committee elements and witness the souls of some of the developers leaving their bodies. If you’re looking for another “Open World: The Game,” this one has you covered.",,"Gotham Knights should not be confused as a sequel to the excellent Batman: Arkham Knight. Instead this Spin-Off explores a new and interesting story about the death of Gotham’s protector and falls victim to some of modern gaming’s worst trends. The crafting system feels unsubstantial and while the four different playable characters are all different and interesting, it feels like substantial abilities of the prior games were taken away and locked behind different characters, rather than each member of the bat family bringing something new to the table. Despite its shortcomings and missteps, we found “Gotham Knights” to be very fun to play, when focusing on the story over the repetitive open world activities and the multiplayer is an excellent fit for both the story and style of game.",,,,"Living in the shadow of something greater is a recurring theme with Gotham Knights. Like its motley cast of heroes, the game sometimes struggles to live up to the expectations set upon it. None of Gotham’s heroes were ever going to be just like Batman, and Gotham Knights was never going to be just like Rocksteady’s Arkham games. Once I could accept that, I could see the game for what it is: a multiplayer superhero game with a creative narrative that plays it safe with gameplay, sometimes to its detriment.",,,"Gotham Knights did an outstanding job at making me really feel like I was a vigilante protecting the city, the immersion level is Gotham Knights greatest achievement.",,,,,"This is a slight muddle of a game, but it has its pleasures.",,,,,,,"Gotham Knights is a good action game with a great story, funny combat and interesting co-op options. Is not as brilliant as the Arkham series, but is easy to enjoy with Nightwing, Robin, Red Hood or Batgirl. [Recommended]","Gotham Knights brings a familiar world and characters, borrowing basics from the Arkham series, but lacks the polish that the Arkham series was known for. It offers fun co-op and variable characters, but the side content sometimes seems rather generic.",,,,,,,,,,,"Despite Gotham Knight's cooperative multiplayer and many customization options, vigilante justice can’t save this open-world action-RPG from mediocrity.",,,,,,,"Batman has trained these heroes for this moment, but they aren't ready to rise to the occasion just yet with Gotham Knights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gotham Knights takes the concept of inconsequential open world busywork to a ludicrous extreme, exquisitely culminating years of creative laziness in the genre. Nothing can adequately convey how monotonous, how unimaginative, how fucking banal this thing is. It manages to be offensive in its structural mediocrity, and that’s before we consider its enervative combat, inadequate controls, and threadbare world. Wearing the flayed skin of a live service and managing to be worse than any one of them, this sorry mockery of the Arkham series will rightly be forgotten in a year’s time - sooner if we’re lucky.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
greak-memories-of-azur,"It's a shame that for how great Greak: Memories of Azur looks and sounds, it’s brought way down by its artificial difficulty from its poor escort controls and mechanics. I should want to play more the further I get into a game’s world, but instead the longer it went on, the less I was enjoying it, simply wanting it to be over due to its controls. Controlling multiple characters is much more frustrating than it should be, especially given how stunning its visuals are. I wanted to love Greak: Memories of Azur on its gorgeous aesthetic alone, but find it hard to recommend at its current price point due to having to constantly babysit multiple characters for a ten hour playthrough.","All in all, there’s a lot to like about Greak: Memories of Azur. Combat is fun, traversal is engaging and the tale is told well, with the plight of the characters really sucking you in. There’s a little too much fetch questing going on for my liking, and those respawning enemies can do one, but on the whole this is something worth checking out.",,,"Greak: Memories of Azur is the very embodiment of a game of two halves. It looks incredible, there’s no two ways about it, and when playing as a single character, the gameplay is extremely good. It’s in the later stages when trying to manage three characters at once that annoyances creep in. Overall, Greak is a good game, but there are some control gremlins to overcome.","Greak will probably caught your attention thanks to its beautiful aesthetic, but it will soon show the signs of a design approach that just don’t fit its rigidly single player nature. Handling 2-3 characters simultaneously without the help of an A.I. would always going to be a drag. Additionally, the story is short and gives the impression that it’s only the prologue of a larger story that we may see in a sequel.",Greak: Memories of Azur is a fantasy adventure full of possibilities thanks to the introduction of different characters.,,,,,,"A truly original game in its genre but enjoyable, but unlikely to remain in your head over the years due to some gameplay flaws.",,,,"There are brief flashes of something special in Greak: Memories of Azur, but, sadly, they're mired by sloppy execution and a litany of irritations that seem to have been implemented by design, rather than by accident.",,,,,,,,"Greak: Memories of Azur has a lot going for it. I just wish that its core concept of controlling three characters at the same time worked better. Too often, instead of being helpful, your siblings just end up getting in the way. If you can look past these sections, though, you’ll find a beautiful game with some great puzzles and a lot of heart.",,,,,,"Greak: Memories of Azur truly is a lovely production that largely deserves to be acknowledged. The delightful and hand-drawn sceneries and animations are completed with a mesmerising soundtrack. Whoever is fond of Ori should also be satisfied with the title’s main gameplay. But Greak: Memories of Azur was not keen on being solely a simple Metroidvania. It allows itself the luxury of drawing some inspirations from Trine and offers us to play as not one, but three characters with different abilities. Unfortunately, this addition doesn’t run smoothly and the simultaneous handling of the three heroes quickly lost us, especially during the boss fights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Greak: Memories of Azur is tantalisingly close to being a good game, but multiple design decisions pull it back from a recommendation.

dynasty-warriors-9-empires,,"I don’t know who Dynasty Warriors 9 Empires is for. The base game has a big fan base and the 1 vs 1000 combat is always fun to wade through. That’s no exception here the combat is still as fun as it ever was but unfortunately, the maps all feel the same and that battlefield rarely changes. I can’t get any joy from the strategy element and for me, it sucks a lot of life out of the game for little reward.",,,"Summing up Dynasty Warriors 9 Empires is tricky. While the fighting action is as spectacular as it ever was, and still remains fun, the management side of things just seems to slow everything down. It feels like a slog and you’ll want for nothing but the next battle. Basically the battles are good, but the rest of Dynasty Warriors 9 Empires is poor.",,"Unfortunately Dynasty Warriors 9 Empires continues to carry a disease that seems to have taken control of the saga: a very poor technical aspect, and a terrible optimization that goes against the player’s experience. However, if you can put that aside, the game itself is fun and adds simple, yet interesting strategy and management elements that paired with the musou addictive gameplay can provide hours of fun,",,,,,,,,,,,,"Dynasty Warriors 9 Empires is a fantastic hack n slash tactical game. You must spin many plates as you try to conquer each kingdom. Balance your people, food, captains, and battles as you progress across the empire. It's tough, addictive, and brutal as hell.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Dynasty Warriors 9 had already strongly disappointed us and this new “Empires” episode was our last hope for the license to turn things around. Unfortunately, it won’t happen any time soon as Omega Force relies on its assets and barely reworks its franchise. Technically speaking, the game is just as dated as its predecessor, which was already a big problem four years ago. This could’ve been overlooked if one could at least find happiness elsewhere. But with a strategic dimension smeared by menus that are far too confusing and a weariness that quickly grows on us even during combat, it is difficult to recommend this game. It’s high time for Omega Force to wake up and offer us an experience worthy of what gamers expect in 2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dynasty Warriors 9 Empires is a title that, if taken in small doses, is absolutely capable of pampering and entertaining the admirers of the saga and of the strategic drift undertaken by the Empires vein. However, its combat system is still too immature and repetitive, especially when compared to the achievements of the licensed musou that Omega Force and Koei Tecmo Games have given us in recent years. Thanks to the dated technical sector and the questionable recycling of equally obsolete assets, we find no reason that can justify the publisher's decision to offer it at full price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dynasty Warriors 9 Empires simply lacks the essential fun factor that makes you want to play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Build on the rocky foundation of Dynasty Warriors 9, Dynasty Warriors 9: Empires is inherently flawed, both when it comes to its technical aspects as well as its gameplay variety. With only siege battles throughout the entire campaign, you’d think that the streamlined combat and barebones graphics would be enough to break the game’s back but they didn’t. Dynasty Warriors 9: Empires manages to cleverly link battles, relationships with other officers and empire-management together into an addictive gameplay loop that works despite all its glaring flaws. The game can be a lot of fun, even if pleasure is as guilty as it's always been with the series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battlefield-2042,,"Apart from a few niggling bugs my overall experience of Battlefield 2042 was great. I had a blast sharpening my skills and learning the new mechanics of the game, like the addition of changing the capture points to sectors sometimes battling for 3 objectives in point A, bringing more tactics into your play. With a 10 hour trial thanks to Game Pass/EA Play subscriptions, I would highly recommend at the very least checking the game out this way – I think you’ll enjoy it!",,"Battlefield 2042 is a bit of a mixed bag as things stand right now with the excellent Portal mode overshadowing almost everything else on offer. The futuristic large-scale battles are spectacular stuff, for sure, but it's all a little disjointed so far with the all-new Specialists underlining a feeling that solo soldiering has somehow taken precedent over the series' signature teamwork. There's still plenty to enjoy in this meaty package for early adopters, and we've no doubt DICE will be busy improving things as the months roll on but, outside of a mode that celebrates the series' history more than it embraces what's new in this latest entry, what's here struggles to feel absolutely essential at launch.","Battlefield 2042 is far from perfect, but it isn’t bad. It’s fun to fight and it’s great to be able to drive vehicles across huge maps. Hell, it’s even enjoyable to crash a jet into some unsuspecting soldier on the ground. There are bugs, but patches are planned so hope should be held. In the meantime, Battlefield Portal is almost worth the price of admission itself.",,"Battlefield 2042 has a great technical section and is really fun, but the lack of content makes it an empty title at launch.",,,,,,"Battlefield 2042 had all the right cards to offer an incredible experience - huge maps, more players (bots included), destructive weather events and the promising Portal mode. It is, however, unfortunately incomplete due to technical glitches, missing features and senseless design choices. The potential to become one of the best episodes of the saga is there, but it will take time and many corrective updates.","Battlefield 2042 is a good game, capable of offering a fantastic war experience. Despite having great successes, it also has some flaws that tarnish the final result. However, with some adjustments, DICE's game could once again achieve the success of the classic games.","Right now, Battlefield 2042 is offering plenty of new features and gameplay elements that will benefit the series’ veteran players, although I’m not sure if there is enough there to hold the attention of players that don’t already have a vested interest in it, at least while they wait for the various problems to be fixed. That really is a shame because even though the persistent issues are frustrating, unnecessary, and annoying, underneath it all is a game that is brimming with potential, and one that I’m enjoying much of my time with — combat is tense, challenging, and unpredictable, and it offers the very best Battlefield experience in recent years... when it hits right.",,,,,,,,,,"While not all of the features Battlefield 2042 introduces are a hit, and the lack of a single-player component is a little disappointing, the game still manages to deliver the same spectacular skirmishes fans of the series crave with its explosive 128-player conflicts and satisfying selection of near-future weaponry and gadgets. Add to that the impressive Portal Mode, which has the potential to keep a steady stream of community-created content flowing, and Battlefield 2042 could very well keep your itchy trigger finger soothed for the foreseeable future. Whether you’re a longtime fan of the franchise looking to dominate the leaderboards or a greenhorn ready for your first tour of duty, Battlefield 2042 delivers something worth fighting for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Battlefield 2042 is a huge disappointment for gamers and the Battlefield franchise. Had this been the product of an indie developer, then this might be a different story as it would be understandable how a game like this could be the product of an independent studio that doesn’t have enormous corporate backing. Instead, EA pumped more resources into creating a CGI film that acts as the only real source of storyline context than ensuring the game was going to live up to the enormous amount of hype they were trying to create. I hate saying such negative things in my reviews, but when a game developer can’t be bothered to even try and live up to it’s own legacy, then I have to call it as I see it and for that very reason, I don’t recommend this game. Not even the nostalgia or temptation of ‘Battlefield Portal’ is enough to save this game from itself.",,,"What Battlefield 2042 does well, it does really well, but it sometimes can’t help but be held down under the weight of its own scale.",,,,,,,"Battlefield 2042 isn't a bad shooter, but to release in this quarter of this year it really needed to bring its A-game, and it hasn't done that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Battlefield 2042 is a pretty huge disappointment. And it's hard to think if there's was a way to make things even worse. It would be great if instead of this game EA would just make a full re-release of Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 - the consoles userbase would surely appreciate the the move.,,,,,,"Battlefield 2042 has everything you want as a Battlefield fan: destruction, levolution, and carnage. But while it’s fun to play, it is clear that Battlefield 2042 is DICE’s most ambitious Battlefield yet - and it hasn’t quite come off in the way many were expecting.","It's not as unsalvageable as Battlefield 5, but it's still hard to imagine this evolving into the definitive Battlefield game that DICE wants it to be. There is fleeting fun to be had here, but it's often spoiled by the game's blatant shortcomings. The maps are a slog, gunplay is bogged down by puzzling design choices, and there's no shortage of bugs that actively require the player to restart the entire game. It's a far cry from the 10-year-old Battlefield 3 and as it continues to age, the series strays further away from those glory days with no road to redemption in sight.",,,,,,,,"Battlefield 2042 absolutely should have been pushed back by EA and DICE to some point in 2022. Instead, the version of this game that is currently available has been virtually unplayable for me at times since first releasing. Even beyond this, though, some of the key design changes that DICE has made in Battlefield 2042 don't feel for the better. Rather than improving on the core Battlefield experience that fans loved with Battlefield 3, 4, or Bad Company 2, 2042 is a bloated husk of its former self that is trying to recapture some semblance of its previous glory. As a fan that has been playing this series for well over a decade, Battlefield 2042 is a massive disappointment that I struggle to think is even worth saving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Battlefield has had some shaky launches in the past, and there’s no reason not to think that things will eventually be smoothed over in Battlefield 2042 over time. However, Battlefield 2042 is also weighed down by design issues and missing features. You’re going to want to wait on this one, and even then give some thought to skipping this iteration in the series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, a decent shooter that feels a little too overblown for its own good.

vampire-the-masquerade---swansong,"Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong is sure to be enjoyed by fans of the genre who will enjoy their time with a narrative heavy experience. At the same time, seasoned RPG players might have higher expectations than they will receive from Swansong. To be more specific, if you're a fan of tabletop RPGs or have pre-existing knowledge of the predecessors then I'm not sure Swansong will be for you. I have overall enjoyed Swansong despite all my complaints as it has a well thought-out storyline and great mystery to it, which ultimately is what truly kept me interested in continuing the journey but it is quite expensive when not on sale.","Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong feels like a bit of a flat, confused mess. The story has some intrigue about it and the characters are interesting but some of the conversations had in the game are so serious that it sometimes feels mundane. If you like detective games with a twist then there is some joy to be had here but I feel it is a bit of a disservice to vampires.",,"Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong is certainly a super-stylish narrative RPG, and it's one that gets off to a strong start, offering up a truly intriguing premise, before falling victim to tedious investigative gameplay, undercooked conversational aspects and a host of bugs that make progress frustrating at points. There's just too much jank here, levels are too rigid, there's not enough freedom in how you go about your investigations or use your vampiric powers to really make things sing and, as a result, we're left with a game that fails to fully live up to its early promise. It's not a bad effort, but with a little more care and polish, it could have been so much more.","Those looking for an original story-based, fully realised, world with loads of vampires should get playing Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong.",,"Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong is a bloodthirsty adventure with a conglomeration of various dialectical aspects, focusing on the essence of self and power.",,,,,,,"Despite the interesting premise, Vampire: The Masquerade-Swansong, its messy story and empty characters may not be entertaining at all even if you're a fan of the series.",,,"Should you manage to look past the shoddy presentation and dodgy visuals, Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong will reveal itself to be a mildly engaging tale of hidden bloodsuckers, unravelling a mystery brimming with murder and betrayal. Beauty, in this case, really is more than skin deep.","If the teeming universe of Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong is a tedious entry for newcomers, it does not become less exciting once mastered. Fans of the Big Bad Wolf studio will probably be delighted by the formula ""The Council way World of Darkness""; Mean by that a system of dialogues of choice revisited by the controlled addition of RPG mechanics. Swansong unfolds a story consisting, sometimes too much, led by three protagonists with an impeccable style whose progression remains fairly linear.","Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong should have been fantastic, but it wasn't. It has some excellent characters and an array of interesting missions. Somehow, though, it still falls short. With bland conversation and a flat atmosphere, every task is an uphill struggle. It's a real shame as it could, and should have worked well.",,"Swansong promised a lot but delivered what I felt to be a severely flawed gaming experience. Quality cut-scenes alone cannot carry a title and that has been proved out here. With boring, glacially paced gameplay, janky controls and far too many technical issues wiping out any sense of pleasure gained from playing through to the games anti-climax, I was left wanting.",,"I really wanted to love Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong. I already am a fan of its setting, desperately want AA video games to rise in prominence again, and love slow burns that are focused on character dialogue and interactions. However, there is just too much getting in the way of Swansong’s success. There is no way of knowing exactly what happened, but the final product is one that I can’t even recommend picking up on sale.",,,,,,,,Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong proposed an adventure riddled with small flaws that prevents you from fully enjoying its scenario despite the latter being interesting once you manage to get into it: this truly leaves a rather bitter taste. It is in its last part that the game gives us all its assets and finally rewards you for having held on until then – if you managed to do so…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong is a great mixture of mystery adventure and role-playing game. It well captures its table-top template and should fascinate its fans, but also manages to take along gamers without prior knowledge of the series.",,,,,,,"The storytelling is king in Swansong and players will find a world that is full of complicated politics, a deep lore, relationship juggling that can be overwhelming. Luckily the game does an excellent job of slowly revealing this world to players, but those who are not a fan of slower, adventure games they should look elsewhere. While there isn’t much in the way of the tradiontial vampire violence that some players may be looking for; those that give this a try will find a journey through a world of darkness, intrigue, murder and decisions that can shape the outcome of the narrative leading to multiple endings. While I am still waiting with bated breath, hoping that Bloodlines 2 will see the light of the moon, Vampire the Masquerade – Swansong is a great introduction to the lore of this world, and despite the issues I had with the facial animations I enjoyed my time here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This isn’t a great game, but it’s one that should satisfy Sonic fans desperate for an interesting game starring their favorite blue blur, and for the first time in a long time, it feels like the series may have a sense of direction. There’s still work to be done to make it more than that, but this is a big step in the right direction.",,,,,,"Sonic Frontiers leaves us rather puzzled. On the one hand, the novelty of an open world full of activities and combat zones, the diversity of the paths through the portals and the number of collectibles enchants us. On the other hand, the outdated graphics, the mediocre dubbing and the poor story is disheartening. Striking a balance, the speed phases are successful, both visually and with the controller. Sega’s title suffers from shortcomings that could have been avoided, thus categorising it as nothing more than an “average and decent game”. What a pity for the long-awaited return of our blue supersonic hedgehog.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite a very rough start and many technical issues is Sonic Frontiers a game that we thoroughly enjoyed. It may very well be an odd form of Stockholm syndrome, being enchanted by the cringe-worthy voice acting, the absurd story, all mixed with some of the best gameplay flow the sonic games ever had in the third dimension. As soon as some of the big boss battles hit, the game shows that it’s much more than just a cheap imitation of Breath of the Wild. A full recommendation however isn’t possible with the technical state the game released in. A few patches are desperately needed for fix some of the glitches and underwhelming textures and animations.",,,"A game caught between ideas, Sonic Frontiers is bland and unfulfilling.

There is so much to do across the title, supported by one of the most interesting Sonic stories in a long time. The new combat and exploration focus opens up Sonic's move set into an almost sandbox environment for players to play with which just feels so right. Obviously, there are a few tiny rough edges as expected with such a game but with a couple of patches this could easily be the best Sonic game out there. Highly recommended!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sonic Frontiers is broken beyond belief with mechanics that barely work and a camera so disastrous it’s literally sickening. The “Open Zones” are disjointed, unpopulated wastelands that do less than nothing to justify their depressing existence. An unpleasant mess, looking and feeling like a mishmash of disparate assets duct taped together, and that’s before we consider the damning amount of recycled content. It’s honestly embarrassing that any professional studio could have made something so cheap, so sad, and so thoroughly incompetent. Even by Sonic Team’s low standards, this is pathetic...Yep, that’s the word for it...Sonic Frontiers is fu..ing pathetic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
monster-energy-supercross---the-official-videogame-4,"Although Monster Energy Supercross: The Official Videogame 4 looks better and has seen noticeable improvements in its menus, career mode and some of its racing mechanics, it’s simply not fun due to punishing physics and cheap A.I.

For now, at least.","As a newcomer, I didn’t particularly enjoy my time in the realm of Monster Energy Supercross 4. However, this is the same way I felt about all racing games in general. In particular, I would’ve loved it if Supercross 4 held onto newcomers’ hands more throughout the racing process and terminologies instead of having us come in last place every time. Still, I find myself determined to learn how to play and plan to have myself invested in the compound mode in order to learn the right and proper way to race.

Besides a few creepy images of certain ghosts, there is nothing that really causes much of a jump let alone a true scare, and whilst the story has the potential to be one of true Japanese horror, the horrible pacing and repetitive nature ensure that the Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water goes down as an underwhelming return for what used to be one of the greatest series in horror gaming.",,"Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water is the weakest of the Fatal Frame games and this remastered version fails to address its biggest issues, namely clunky traversal mechanics and a seriously wooden cast of characters.

It may not be the best game in the franchise, but this remaster will still give your spine a good tingle if you let it.",A divisive entry remains as divisive as ever; Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water on Xbox offers a highly intriguing premise but is let down by a plot that progresses at a snail’s pace. You spend a lot of time in-game wading through water and this serves as a perfect metaphor for how playing the game feels.,,"Project Zero comes back to life with a lackluster remaster that brings no new features.

The problem is that in everything else the game fails. Although its initial premise is very intriguing, the game fails to develop its plot at a good pace.

wanted-dead,"Even though I think the difficulty can be a little over tuned at times and the checkpoints are a little too spread out at times, for every moment I had frustration, I was still compelled to move forward and try again and again. Sometimes you just need a game where you turn off your brain to slash and blast everything in your way and can have fun doing so with some over the top violence, Wanted: Dead delivers that, even if it does feel way over the top with its style.","Less time spent on the needlessly long cutscenes and in-between mission sections, and more on the feel of the combat and we could have had a little gem on our hands. As it is, this only gets a recommendation for those willing to suffer for their entertainment.",,"Wanted: Dead is an incredibly disappointing action effort that presents some decent ideas but fails to execute any of them properly. The idea of fusing hack and slash combat with shooter mechanics has lots of potential here, and the cyberpunk setting is initially intriguing. However, in practice it's all very clunky and janky and frustrating and beset by performance issues. There's a bunch of odd side activities thrown in to try to lighten the mood between battles, but it's just not enough in the end. With a very weak narrative, poor voice-acting, rubbish action and drab level design, this is one game that's best avoided.","Wanted: Dead doesn’t give a damn what you think. It throws ideas at you left, right and centre, with reckless abandon. Luckily, most of them stick to form this weird and wonderful video game.",,"Although it is from the creators of Ninja Gaiden, Wanted: Dead still has a good way to go to become one. Good ideas and an interesting action design lost due to technical problems and poorly calibrated difficulty.",,,,,,"Wanted: Dead is only half a successful experiment. The idea of mixing the shooter genre with the hack'n'slash action game one is good, but it is dwarfed by the shallowness of some of the mechanics, a substandard technical realisation and problematic balancing.","There are things about Wanted: Dead that I really liked and others that really annoyed me. With technical tweaks and quality of life improvements it can become a very enjoyable game that seeks a niche of players who missed certain transgressive, immature and fun-seeking games from a few years ago.","Wanted: Dead is very much an acquired taste, but those for whom its eclectic nonsense clicks will likely love it, even if it's not technically a great game. It's a throwback to a bygone age of gaming that's clearly made with passion, with the team just doing whatever the hell it likes rather than sticking to typical gaming standards to create something that certainly stands out in the modern landscape, if not always in the way it intends to. Stingy checkpointing can kill the game's momentum should you fall foul of a tricky encounter and have to replay large portions of a level, but there will be some folks who like that extra punishment for failure — just as with more or less everything else about Wanted: Dead, it's all going to land for someone out there, and I can see this one going down as a bit of a cult classic.",,"On paper, Wanted: Dead has everything you could possibly want from an action game, but it’s mired in poor execution, ropey presentation, and more than a few unusual design choices. Wanted? We’re not so sure.",,,,"Frankly, this game just isn’t very good.",,,"The visuals are great, and the story may be a tad generic but fits well into the kind of world they built. I hope to get better at the game and think we need more games that bring melee action into the blend of shooters, but the controls need to feel just right for it to work on a grand scale. Wanted: Dead is an okay hybrid game and despite it giving me vibes from my time with Devil’s Third, this is a way better experience overall and would-be players should check all the videos before making that final decision.",,,,,,,"It is important to highlight that Wanted Dead offers an old-fashioned experience on every aspect. The shooter part of the game is not very well done, unlike the hand-to-hand aspect which is much more qualitative. In many ways, you can feel the lack of balance between next-gen and old-school games and that the development had to meet certain specifications, which absolutely failed to seduce us. Be warned that Wanted Dead proposes an experience for gamers whose credo is retro gaming. If you are a nostalgic of the Dreamcast, PS2 and Xbox era, go for it, otherwise it might be painful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wanted: Dead has a charm and sense of humor that is rarely found in modern games, and it backs that up with an amazing combat system that only gets better the more you play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wanted: Dead falls short of the reputation of Ninja Gaiden's developers. Not only it doesn't bring anything new, but it also demeans everything that already exists, adding elements that detract from what is essential in a video game, regardless of genre.

Instead the game kept making me frustrated at every turn. There have been a million examples of how to make a challenging game without making it frustrating.

Not quite an Ace, Matchpoint is far from giving Tennis Elbow as well and a great first showing from Torus Games.",,,"Matchpoint: Tennis Championships deserves your attention on Xbox Game Pass, as it's genuinely one of the better Xbox tennis games we've seen in years. It has its drawbacks, particularly in the presentation department, but it's also good fun when you get out on the court. Unfortunately, some of that enjoyment has been taken away for us because even on the highest difficulty, the game just feels far too easy at launch, rendering a lot of the strategic elements and Career Mode's features somewhat useless for now. It's still a pretty good game regardless, but definitely in need of a couple of balancing tweaks over the coming weeks and months.",Matchpoint - Tennis Championships is less of a winning smash and more of a missed dropshot.,,Matchpoint Tennis Championships is the new installment of professional tennis that comes to our consoles.

recompile,"While I wasn’t much of a fan of the backtracking and not knowing what upgrades I got or missed, or its clumsy combat, Recompile still gave me a unique gaming experience I’m glad to have had. Its visuals are gorgeous at times, even with its minimalistic style, and while the story isn’t told in a traditional way, I quite enjoyed its concept. Given that it’s also included on Xbox Game Pass, there’s no reason to not check it out and see if it’s a program you’d like to execute or not.","It looks utterly gorgeous, has an oddly stirring soundtrack, and the core gameplay loop is simply fun to engage with. Traversing the digital landscapes as they fill in and focus in front of us is a treat, and even though they may look initially daunting in size, there’s a smart logic to how they unfold every time. Each new power up comes along at just the right time (well, mostly) and clocking in at around 8-10 hours it’s not an overly long title to get through. Plus, there’s a genuinely interesting story to weave together throughout, and as noted above it’s well worth going back and hunting any missed logs to get the ‘true’ ending. Some weak combat and fiddly UI are the only real blemishes on an other great title, and I can confidently recommend this as something to check out.",,,"The moment-to-moment gameplay is a blast and the visuals really are a sight to behold. However, unless you’re a super completionist, you may not want to stick around with Recompile much longer than taking a quick peek since the story, frustrating design choices, and disappointing boss fights can drag the experience down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I love the way Recompile looks, and a Metroidvania with this much freedom could definitely work. To do so however, it would need to clean the world design up enough that you can tell where you’re going. A tighter jump or more forgiving platforms would go a long way as well. As is, far too much progress in Recompile feels like it comes down to luck and repetition rather than skill. Game Pass subscribers who love the look may want to give this one a chance, but most players will quickly want to eject from this drive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Recompile is a short-lived metroidvania with a great story but forgettable platforming, puzzles, and combat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alas, a little too often, Recompile only seems to prove we should be careful what we wish for.

However, the saving grace is that its not a long journey through the motherboard, that is to say it is thankfully pretty short. So those folks that are forever chasing those achievements can rack up some score here, and its on Game Pass which makes the cost of admission even better.

werewolf-the-apocalypse---earthblood,,"Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Earthblood is a bit of mediocre game in very sparkly packaging. I was drawn to the trailer as the transitions to a werewolf looked stunning and I thought this would really be a good play through to test the Xbox Series X. The transitions in the game are quite cool, from human to lupus is neat and the burst into the Crinos form was great at the start. But after you clear a room of enemies with the powerful form you revert back into your human form like nothing has happened and it all feels a bit flat which is a feeling you carry throughout the game.",,"We're stuck between a rock and a hard place with Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood, because while it definitely has its downsides (some of them potentially deal-breaking, especially if buying it at full price) we also enjoyed our time with it.

dolmen,"For those that truly enjoy Souls games, even budget titles, Dolmen should give you a good twenty or so hours of content to get through, but at its current high price I can only suggest waiting for a massive sale for the rest of everyone else curious. While I didn’t enjoy it nearly as much as say Hellpoint, I have to commend their bravery releasing this so shortly after Elden Ring. There’s some good ideas here, and with some more polish and refining I probably would have enjoyed my time with Dolmen much more than I did, but as it stands now I simply wanted it to end.","Sadly, whilst Dolmen is a game that may have been well suited 10 or 15 years ago, with a ton of souls-likes already out there such as The Surge, Hellpoint, Mortal Shell, Nioh, and so on, there is a lot to achieve if you want to make it as a memorable experience in the action RPG genre, and Dolmen doesn’t stand up there with the cream of the crop already available.",,,"Dolmen doesn’t do itself any favours.

Technically speaking, the game suffers from shortcomings impeding the gameplay, and therefore our wish to keep on with it. It is a pity because the combinations between melee and ranged attacks, as well as the character progression and equipment bonuses all show that Massive Work Studio has tried to distance itself from other souls-like games. For the time being, we hope that the Brazilian studio will opt for a big update to make the character’s defensive actions more fluid, which will at least make the game more enjoyable to begin with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Extremely derivative on a playful level and technically insufficient even by the standards of the last generation (and beyond), Dolmen is an experiment that was only minimally successful. While we liked the Lovecraftian atmosphere and the constant sense of danger that permeates the entire production, everything else should be rethought at the root. The inclusion of firearms could really add something new to the genre, but nefarious management of the energy bar ended up compromising the effectiveness of gun-play as well. Although the title is offered at the modest sum of € 39.99, at present there is no valid reason why RPG enthusiasts should prefer it to the much more inspired and deserving soulslike ones that have invaded the market in recent weeks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dolmen provides fans of SciFi and Souls games with another daunting adventure full of defeat and satisfaction.

The melee is not consistent, enemy AI is weak, the exploration is not deep, and the level design is just passable. What Dolmen does well is sci-fi flavored third-person shooting with a good level of challenge that isn’t a cakewalk.

It was a bad time to release a game of this type when it falls so short of the mark set by the best in the genre and even falls below the current imitators.

Nonetheless, the title offers a dynamic and pleasant gameplay sublimated by a decent soundtrack and level design. It’s a shame the game gets tarnished by small technical glitches and defects. As is, and as long as those issues haven’t been fixed, we’d say wait a bit before buying it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Necromunda: Hired Gun has an iconic setting, lots of gore, and great mobility and gunplay, but it keeps giving you reasons to not play it.

This is the type of design that's overflowing with ideas, mixing and matching concepts from other titles just to see what sticks. Even if the game doesn't come together as a cohesive whole, there's enough fun here to keep fans of FPS and 40K happy. Combine all that with the beautifully realized environments of Warhammer's darkest underground city and Necromunda: Hired Gun gives off a great vibe and ends up enjoyable despite itself.",,,,Some good warhammer 40k vibes can be found here but there’s just a bit too much going on in Necromunda: Hired Gun. The fast-paced FPS gameplay needs refining and is constantly slowed down by the RPG elements which in turn are not allowed to shine through the FPS aspect. I actually think this setting would lend itself more to a Skyrim style RPG more so than a first person shooter but this is what we got and I am actually a bit gutted that I can’t like it more than I do.,,,,,,,,,,"It saddens us to see a game with such potential, fall so far from grace. The gunplay and weapon variety kept us coming back for more, but every time we played one of the mind-numbingly boring side missions to grind for the expensive upgrades, we regretted our decision to turn on the console. Some aspects are fixable, no doubt and eventually Necromunda: Hired Gun might be worth your time.

mx-vs-atv-legends,"A lack of meaningful customization, slippery and borderline broken controls based on which vehicle you want to race, and PowerPoint slide deck animations was a constant disappointment and frustration. Yes there are three full Career Modes to sink time into and track designs were quite good with varying elevations and layouts, but the myriad of issues makes MX vs ATV Legends a low point for the series, even at its normally reasonable $40 CAD asking price. I normally wouldn’t recommend getting an older game in a series, but when MX vs ATV Reflex from 2009 is still the best in the series, that speaks volumes.","Overall and whilst MX vs ATVs arrival on current-gen consoles was always one we were going to expect, it’s shocking to see it arrive in such a poor state. With glitches galore and a real lack of polish all around, what has long been an exciting series release has this time turned into something that feels like a rushed release that would have really benefitted from utilizing the extra power of current generation consoles to push out something spectacular rather than another general churned out release.

As it is at present, it's just an okay one, with a general lack of both polish and event variety letting things down somewhat. The bugs and glitches currently present in the game have knocked our score down a tad as well, although hopefully, they'll be sorted soon after release. The game's cut-price $40 entry point makes this one that bit more appealing, but we can only really recommend it once the bugs have been fully ironed out. 'Legends'?

Gameplay has got get more focused as well; I’m all for such an unusual mixture of enemies and cross-genre gameplay blends and inspirations, but it’s got to tie together somehow to make some sense and matter to the player. I don’t need a grand story, but I am hoping that the full game makes a lot more sense than this current offering which seems like someone brainstorming out loud, so to speak. All that to say, for $8, and with very limited new game+ options, you could do worse — but it might be just as well to wait until Bright Memory: Infinite launches in full next year.",,,,,Bright Memory is a profoundly bland experience riddled with hints that the game was never meant to be played anywhere but PC.,,,,"On its own merits, Bright Memory is short, rough around the edges and has a somewhat forgettable storyline.

If Bright Memory was a free game, it would be easier to recommend. As even a low-price game, it is hard to sell as representing the power of the new console. If anything, it might be responsible for a little buyer remorse, so my suggestion would be to skip this port and wait for Bright Memory: Infinite in 2021.",,,,,,"Bright Memory shouldn’t be played; it’s just not ready. The one-person developed action is a decent concept, but it should have been released as a demo in anticipation for Bright Memory: Infinite.

the-last-oricru,"For how clunky the overall experience is, I will admit there’s plenty of replay value if you can ignore all of its shortcomings, issues and suffer through Silver's delivery. While some might not being locked into their choices permanently, it makes you deal with the consequences of your actions, also a clever way to force multiple playthroughs if you want to experience everything The Last Oricru has to offer and I did enjoy going with my gut reaction rather than seeing a ‘good’ vs ‘bad’ option. Unless you’re a massive Soulslike fan looking for a new game to stream or master, it’s hard to recommend joining the Ratvolution.",,,,"The Last Oricru is a bit of a mixed bag, even if it is mostly one filled with goodies. What it does, it does pretty well, but basic things like a hysterical camera that is keen to show you anything except the bloke smacking you with a sword, do put a dent in the enjoyment. Playing cooperatively is a great idea, and having a friend along can make things better, but even then there are better entries in the action RPG genre.","The Last Oricru, to its credit, doesn't want to sow discord in the gaming family. It stands under the acrobat's rope, confused, with a look full of wonder. Equally bewildered were we who watched its endeavor, hoping at the end that the farce taking place would one day end and the true character of the title would emerge, saving all as a true hero.",The Last Oricru is a narrative action role-playing game that tries to combine the soulslike formula with the factors that affect decision-making.,,,,,,,"The Last Oricru is a game with some brilliant elements and some rather sketchy ones. The game offers combat that works, a good co-op system and an engaging story. Its best achievement is in the branching narrative system that unfolds through the player's decisions. The local and online co-op mode is satisfying and helps you have a good time with your friends, plus it's well thought out and works very well. While in the story and its decision system works, and the graphics, sound and combat deliver, the Souls elements feel alien to the game's identity, and at times take you out of the experience. The overall experience with The Last Oricru is positive and is definitely an option for those who like RPGs.",,,,,"The Last Oricru is a souls-lite title with a strong RPG edge. Furthermore, it has a dry sense of humour, a rich story, and interesting characters. However, poor acting, tainted visuals, and repetitive combat hold it back. Accordingly, you may wish to look elsewhere to get your Soulsborne hit.",,,,,,"The amateur-hour writing and uneven combat are just too difficult to overlook, especially considering just how stuffed the genre is with competing titles that do just about everything The Last Oricru does, only better. Sure there is fun to be hand in exploring Wanderia and its intricate level design, but every “wow” moment is typically followed by a facepalm, as Silver says something that is tonally deaf or falls to yet another attack that should have had no business hitting him. If you’re after another slice of Soulslike action in 2022, then your $40 can absolutely be spent better elsewhere, with The Last Oricru serving as little more than a pale imitation that struggles to even nail the Soulslike fundamentals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Last Oricru is undoubtedly flawed, but underneath a rough exterior and a multitude of bugs and glitches hides a videogame made with clear passion, focusing more on an engaging story with many branching paths rather than a particularly deep combat system or polished looks. The addition of local and online co-op is remarkable and while online co-op brings with it a whole new flood of potential bugs and lag, local multiplayer works remarkably well. With a few patches and the right audience that enjoys flawed but inspired games like Elex or Greedfall, this can become a diamond in the rough.",,,,,,,"I wanted to like The Last Oricru very much, I was intrigued by the fish out of water story, but the abrasiveness of the main character and the basic feeling combat just killed it for me. There is a case here for a strong presentation, the vistas and some of the levels were a joy to explore, also the fact that the game kept what felt like a solid 60 fps was a big plus in this ‘next-gen’ age but there was always something just keeping me from really enjoying myself. Be it the so-so story, the wasted use of souls mechinics or just Silver himself, sadly The Last Oricru just doesn’t add anything new to the genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Last Oricru is a masterpiece of bad design. When a game has to warn its players not to invest in half the available skill points because they’re worthless, you know you’ve got something special, and that’s what Oricru is - special. It’s so profoundly wrong it deserves to be studied, dissected, remembered for years. Its creators should tour universities and give talks about their artistic philosophies so future generations can learn how never to make a videogame. If you’d told me aliens had developed it, I’d struggle to argue, such is the incomprehensible absurdity on display...I am in awe of such a marvel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
balan-wonderworld,,All in all Balan Wonderworld is uninspiring and boring to play.

Sane Trilogy, which contain multiple games) are a lot cheaper and are much better. The ingredients are all there for a great game, but everything has gone off and rotten. What's been cooked up is a bland, uninspired trip into a world that should have been anything but. Balan Wonderworld feels like bargain bin material that should be avoided at all costs... at any discount.",,,"The magic of Night Into Dreams is glimpsed in small glimpses in Balan Wonderworld, a title with a lot of potential that struggles to get off the ground.",,,,,,,"Balan Wonderworld comes to the market as a title designed to make children enjoy. However, the title fails in most of its proposals, being the artistic section and the use of costumes the only thing that allows the title to maintain its composure at some point.",,,"I understand that Balan Wonderworld wasn't made with me in mind – clearly it's meant for a far younger demographic. But even from an objective standpoint, I can't figure out why anyone would want to voluntarily sink hours of their life into such an annoying and incoherent game.","Frustrating in its playability, abstruse in most of its rules, the soft falls without a net. No drama to report: like a drunken cannon-man, Balan Wonderworld misses his target. Too imprecise for the youngest, too basic for fans of the genre, he cannot count on any of his costumes to hide his shortcomings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For better or worse, Balan Wonderworld feels like an HD take on a PS2-era platformer.

I think the game is charming and flawed. It has tons of issues, but I still finished it. I had some good times sprinkled in with the frustrations. It took me to a simpler time in platform games and there is truly nothing else out there with the same kind of presentation and whimsical ideas it delivers. That said $60 is a hard ask for a game that seems to want to frustrate players at every turn. I wanted to love Balan Wonderworld, but it did everything in its power to test my love every chance it got.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Balan Wonderworld is a game of missed opportunities. It’s simplified control scheme robs it of any of the subtle complexity that the genre is best at, its various ideas are half-baked at best, and its core gameplay is a taxing uphill climb through even the most basic of platforming principles.

crossfirex,,"All told then, I was mightily underwhelmed by Crossfire X. While it’s not entirely without merit, there are far better shooters already out there – and on Game Pass – which meant I lost interest in this fast. Clunky combat and menus, requiring an additional purchase for the full campaign, and a bizarre one mode per map multiplayer set up all come together to define Crossfire X as a massive disappointment.",,,CrossfireX is a strange beast which doesn't quite fit together. Odd development decisions and a real lack of ambition result in a barely average experience which pales into insignificance when compared to its competitors and previous developer efforts.,,CrossfireX it’s a complete disappointment. Not even Remedy’s campaign could save a product that lacks originality and soul like this does.,,,"Hints of a solid, finished shooter shine in CrossfireX at times, but at the end of the day, all you're getting is a short, average campaign and a multiplayer experience that lacks content and feels torn between two worlds.",,"Despite leaning heavily on developer Remedy Entertainment’s impressive Northlight game engine and narrative chops for its brief single-player campaign, CrossfireX is ultimately a poorly-written, half-hearted attempt at reviving Smilegate’s dated CrossFire franchise and is best avoided by all but the most loyal Remedy and CrossFire aficionados.","CrossfireX is, more than any other game, a two-sided coin. On one side we get a lacklustre and disappointing multiplayer component, while on the other we have two compelling, spectacular and creative - even if short - CoD-style campaigns, where Remedy's footprint is clearly visible. As a complete package, it's barely sufficient, but since they can be bought separately at a convenient price, we recommend trying the campaigns if you're into this kind of single-player FPS experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, it’s just hard to recall a less ambitious multiplayer shooter than CrossfireX. Its generic single player campaign fares much better than its multiplayer, which is simply lacking in everything we’ve come to expect from the genre. Smilegate’s previous shooters have obviously connected with millions in the Asian market, but it’s hard to imagine CrossfireX igniting anything near that kind of enthusiasm in the very competitive multiplayer scene.",,,,"With a disappointingly short single-player and an unplayable multiplayer, CrossfireX doesn’t bring much to the table.

Alarmingly little of Remedy’s signature weirdness and creativity is displayed, leaving me to wonder why this usually distinctively strange studio was chosen for such a by-the-numbers project at all. There were some interesting ideas along the way where story is concerned and I fleetingly thought we might get an eccentric tale the likes of Control or Alan Wake, but those hopes were quickly dashed when both campaigns ended without even a cursory twist. Whether it’s the bland characters, braindead enemy AI, forgettable levels, or downright offensive controls for the gunplay, everything about these brief campaigns feels phoned in.

It tries to be so many things at once that it's really nothing at all.

If you manage to connect to a server and can deal with a menu that becomes sluggish after every game, you'll find an experience that is dulled by bad design decisions. From a pair of lackluster campaigns to a pittance of maps and modes, there's not much to work with. Combined with tiny maps and shooting mechanics that don't feel good, the shooter is only appealing if you only play free-to-play titles, only care for modern military shooters, don't care for Call of Duty: Warzone, and don't have the Xbox Game Pass.",,"Smilegate itself has admitted that CrossfireX has major problems and seems committed to improving the game moving forward. The matchmaking has worked quite well in our time with the game so far, but the content, controls, and pretty much everything else needs a major facelift.

At least the solo campaign from Remedy is a bit interesting, but that part is not free to play.",,,,,,,"There's really no redeeming quality for the teams behind CrossfireX to look at and say, ""We can build off of that"". It's a bland shooter that doesn't do anything special, and now that I'm done reviewing it I have no plans to ever touch it again. Maybe if they drop another campaign piece I'll try it, but if I'm Remedy I'd get as far away from this one as possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"CrossfireX sees two separate developers – SmileGate and Remedy – take a crack at creating their very own Call of Duty.

It is available on Xbox Game Pass currently, which makes it easier for me to tell people to give it a try, but I warn you, you wont like what you see.

On a technical level, yeah the graphics and framerate and such aren’t bad, but you won’t get to enjoy them because I think you’ll be too distracted with all of the other problems in the game. Voice-acting, the script, the AI, controls, story-telling, the intensely lazy and generic feel of it all, the push for microtransactions — the game is asking players to overlook or otherwise deal with too much. Now, I am an optimistic and forgiving person by nature, but what SmileGate, Remedy, and Microsoft have done here is absolutely regrettable. This game has issues that even patching cannot fix, and I’m typically the first one to point out that games can often be much improved by patching. CrossFireX, though, has problems that run too deep and too broad — and I can’t recommend this game to anyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I can’t recommend an imbalanced and severely dated multiplayer offering and a campaign that doesn’t come anywhere close to the highs of Remedy’s other titles.
