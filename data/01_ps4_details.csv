In this version the textures of the game are more compressed, so you can see that the game’s graphics are clearer and more detailed than before. You will also see that there is no loading time when you enter or exit a level, which makes the navigation even faster and more enjoyable. Ubisoft has also integrated a new Camera Mode on PS4. By pressing the touchpad of the PS4 joystick, you pause the game and enter this mode, and by moving your fingers on the touchpad, you zoom in and out on the image and drag the image frame; and finally, by pressing the Share button, you can take a photo and share it with everyone. This Camera Mode is a great way to observe in detail all the characters and settings of the game, and a great way of expression to create wacky images with the elements found in the game. On PS4, you can also use the touchpad to scrape the famous Lucky Tickets, then you will really feel like you’re scraping lottery tickets (with the sound of scraping straight from the PS4 joystick). Finally, in this PS4 version, you’ll also find new playable heroes: Assassin Ray (a character inspired by Edward Kenway, the hero of Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag), Funky Ray (a delusional character that you can unlock by using Uplay points), and Champion Ray (a character who will be offered to the best players of the community and those who live in this community; this character correspond to the new VIP status, visible in the rankings of online challenges).

Speaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.

HITMAN 3 is the dramatic conclusion to the World of Assassination trilogy and takes players around the world on a globetrotting adventure to sprawling sandbox locations. Agent 47 returns as a ruthless professional for the most important contracts of his entire career.

Supported by his Agency handler, Diana Burnwood, 47 joins forces with his long-lost friend Lucas Grey. Their ultimate mission is to eliminate the partners of Providence, but they are forced to adapt as their hunt intensifies. When the dust settles, 47 and the world he inhabits will never be the same again.
Top of the World
Every mission location in HITMAN 3 is meticulously detailed and packed full of creative opportunities. Players will have unrivalled freedom to complete their objectives and the game world will react to everything they do.
A Platform of Assassination
The World of Assassination trilogy is fully realised with HITMAN 3 as the ultimate place to play all three games. Players of previous HITMAN games will be pleased to know that it will be possible to 'import' locations that they own from the previous two HITMAN games into HITMAN 3, essentially putting all 20+ locations from the entire trilogy in one place.

In Prey: Mooncrash, TranStar's secret moon base stopped transmitting shortly after the events of Prey.

■2 types of panels for everyone to enjoy synthesis!
This game uses panel synthesis, the synthesis system of the Mysterious series, where materials are placed in the panel slots to create new items in this puzzle-like feature. By placing the certain materials in the slots, various effects can be produced.

Streets of Rage, known as Bare Knuckle (Bea Nakkuru) in Japan, is a trilogy of beat 'em up games developed and published by SEGA in the 1990s.

Famously known for its non stop action and electronic dance influenced music - scored by Yuzo Koshiro and Motohiro Kawashima - the series has gained the status of cult classic throughout the years. It is considered one of the best beat 'em up series of all time. After many years, Axel and Blaze are finally picking up the fight where they left.

Featuring hand-drawn visuals from the team behind 2017's gorgeous Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap remake, Streets of Rage 4 builds upon the classic trilogy's gameplay with new mechanics, a fresh story and a gauntlet of dangerous stages with a serious crime problem. Streets of Rage 4 recalls classic gameplay but it stands as an entirely original arcade-style romp thanks to the expertise of Guard Crush Games and Dotemu.

Whether players gang up with a friend or clean up the city solo, Streets of Rage 4 is a skull-bashing, chicken-chomping delight all set to a thumping soundtrack sure to get your blood pumping.

the-eternal-cylinder,https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-eternal-cylinder,Good Shepherd Entertainment,ACE Team,"Sep 30, 2021","PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X","In The Eternal Cylinder, players control a herd of adorable creatures called Trebhums and must explore a strange alien world filled with exotic lifeforms, surreal environments, and the constant threat of the Cylinder, a gargantuan rolling structure of ancient origin which crushes everything in its path. This unique ecosystem is a massive, procedurally generated land with unique animal AI, real-time world destruction, and organic exploration and puzzle design to create emergent gameplay that ensures no two playthroughs are ever the same.
Your Trebhums begin at the bottom of the natural food chain but can mutate and evolve with new physical attributes and abilities by eating a variety of flora and fauna. Discover and adapt dozens of mutations, including new traversal skills like flying and swimming to reach new areas, and new senses to help overcome puzzles, challenges and dangers. Your many Trebhums can each have different mutations, and new mutations don't replace ones you already have, letting you stack ability sets in dynamic ways. Each mutation will also change the physical look of a Trebhum and stacking these will generate near countless surprising new creature designs which players will be able to organically discover as they explore this unique alien ecosystem.

Game Features:

* Unforgettable Alien World to explore: Players must explore a gorgeous procedurally generated world which is populated with unforgettable vistas and unique landscapes which have something new to discover around every corner. The Eternal Cylinder features an open-world which allows players to reach and explore any areas which they can see on the horizon. This encourages constant exploration and ensures that there's always something new to see.

* Real-Time World Destruction: Everything in the world can be destroyed in real-time by The Eternal Cylinder, so players must continuously evade its destructive path in order to survive whilst marveling at the visual splendor of its godlike power.
Story Driven Open-World Survival: Unlike many open-world survival titles, The Eternal Cylinder features a deep and engrossing story for players to uncover as they continue to explore the vast world. The game explores themes of family and heritage, and the lasting power of knowledge.

* Build Your Own Alien Family: Unlike standard survival games where you have a main shelter that you can build or improve, in Eternal Cylinder players develop a nomadic herd of unique alien creatures called Trebhums. Players control one Trebhum from the herd at a time and the rest follow (Al controlled) but players can switch to any individual member of their herd at will. Explore the world to rescue more of your brethren and continuously expand your family. Control a herd which can grow to more than 20 members at any given time and imbue each of your Trebhums with their own unique mutations and skill sets. Players can create a custom name for each of their Trebhum, increasing the emotional bond between player and their Trebhum family.

* Unique Mutation System: Although Trebhum's are generally frail and start their lives at the very bottom of the world's food chain, they have the unique ability to mutate and unlock new skills by consuming natural edibles which populate the game world. So, players must explore and experiment with a vast array of fruits, flora and alien creatures to unlock new powers and gameplay options.

* 50+ Mutations to discover: Players can unlock more than 50+ unique mutations as they explore the world, each one of which enable new gameplay options. These include new traversal options such as the ability to fly and swim, but also new offensive moves like the ability to spit fire and create loud warning noises. New mutations allow players to explore new areas and each mutation stacks thus creating a truly expansive skill set which is constantly evolving.

* A Trebhum for everyone: Enjoy a virtually endless visual variety of Trebhum designs, as each mutation combine with one another to create surprising new creatures. This allows your herd to continue to evolve as players explore new areas and players can share the unique look of their Trebhum family with the rest of the world online.

* Layered Survival: Players need to manage multiple layers of resources in order to be able to survive. These include hydration level, various temperatures each with their own impact and stamina.

* Living and Breathing Ecosystems: The world of The Eternal Cylinder is populated with more than 30 memorable handcrafted alien creatures. These creatures vary greatly in size and range from those smaller than a Trebhum, all the way to skyscraper sized leviathans who dominate the horizon. Each of these creatures feature their own dedicated Al and behave in natural ways. Players must learn their unique behaviors and discover surprising ways to utilize the natural food chain to their advantage and interact with every creature.

* Organic Puzzle Solving and Progression: The world of the Eternal Cylinder has been designed to empower players to organically solve its mysteries and progress without the need for obvious prompts and mission logs. This allows for fully immersive exploration which rewards players of every skill level, as the greater majority of the puzzles are not required for progression but do provide unique experiences.

* 4 Unique Biodomes lo Discover ond Explore: Players can explore 4 unique biodomes including alien savannas and infected habitats, each with their own dedicated ecosystems and unique creatures to discover.

* Truly Emergent Gameplay: The Eternal Cylinder's lush procedurally generated world, vast number of mutations to discover and unlock, unique creature Al system, living natural ecosystem, real-time world destruction and organically placed puzzles combine to create near endless possibilities for emergent gameplay and help to ensure that no two playthroughs will ever be there same.

The Noble and Reformist Factions have been none too kind to one another over the years, and tensions between the two only stand to worsen if compromises aren't reached in the very near future.

Rean Schwarzer, like any other citizen of the Imperial nation, is no stranger to these rising conflicts: the class system has been deeply interwoven into the tapestry of Erebonian culture since the days of old. As a seventeen-year-old student preparing for his new life at Thors Military Academy, however, he notices that his crimson uniform differs from the standard outfits issued to his peerstypically green for commoners, and white for nobles.

Enter, Class VII of Thors Military Academy. For the first time in the prestigious academy's history, rank means nothing and skill means everything. With nine hand-picked students of various backgrounds and abilities, Rean included, Class VII readies itself to dive deep into the political quagmire that threatens not only them, but the very foundations of the Empire.

The original Wasteland was the inspiration for the FALLOUT series of games, and the first RPG to allow players to split parties for tactical considerations, to face players with moral choices, and to make them deal with the consequences of their actions. It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institutions current Art of the Computer Game exhibition.

Wasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions, acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline that allowed for maximum re-playability. Wasteland 2, with your participation and insights, will recapture all that and provide more. It'll finally be the game worthy to be a Wasteland sequel, as challenging and rewarding as the original, with all added capacity and dazzle of games today.

This War of Mine: The Little Ones explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective; that of a child.

Based on This War of Mine, The Little Ones puts you in charge of a group of adults and children stuck in the middle of hell, trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger. The question is: how far will you go to make it through another day?

This War of Mine: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also the fact that even in times of conflict, kids are still kids - they laugh, cry, play with toys and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to bring back the kid in yourself to understand how to protect the little ones. Their faith, and their futures, are in your hands.

The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of young and adult civilians. At night, take one of your people on a mission to scavenge through a city for items that will help you stay alive.

The disaster that separated him from his brother has scarred him for life, and he is lost, alone and in quite a bit of trouble,” said Michel Koch & Raoul Barbet, Co-Creative Directors of Life is Strange 2. “Sean is already at a breaking point, and now faces some of the toughest situations in his life as he desperately searches for Daniel, whose absence hangs heavy over the whole episode.

Puerto Lobos and the dream of freedom have never felt so far away. Will Sean’s faith in Daniel be rewarded – or is the younger wolf lost forever?

When at your base, prepare for your journey by upgrading your brigade! Create new puppet soldiers, assign them different squads and formations, synthesize better equipment, take requests from townsfolk, and get assistance from Dronya in the form of Witch Petitions.

Once you've entered the labyrinth, be sure to search every nook and cranny as you jump over barricades, solve puzzles, and smash your way through walls to delve further and further downward in search of treasure and rare artefacts. But be careful, the more riches you obtain, the more vicious the dungeon becomes. Can you survive long enough to bring your haul back?

Fight past terrifying monsters by giving orders to your puppet brigade. Change their formation, use special skills, or call for an all out attack! The battles you face will be challenging, so your success depends on your preparation and your strategy.

Classics that defined the Castlevania series.

This KONAMI Castlevania Collection is designed to be a collection around the origins of the historic franchise.
Included is a unique eBook that has details provided by developers, artists and other inspired by the Castlevania legacy.
Released as part of the KONAMI 50th Anniversary celebration, now the best time to relive these timeless classics that helped define the platformer genre.

Game List:

Castlevania (1987/US, 1988/EU)
Enter At Your Own Risk! If you think it's scary on the outside, wait till you see the basement.
You're in for the longest night of your life. Ghosts, goblins, demons, wolves, bats creatures lurking around every corner. Better pick up a weapon or two, because when you finally meet the Count, you know he'll be going for the jugular.

Castlevania Simon's Quest1988/US, 1990/EU) NES
This title tells the tale of Simon's subsequent adventures following the events in Castlevania.
Unlike the previous installment, this one was developed as an action RPG. It maintains the action elements of its predecessor but mainly focuses on exploration and puzzle solving within a far more expansive game world.

Castlevania Dracula's Curse (1990/US, 1992/EU) NES
Led by the immortal Count Dracula, the greatest army of evil ever assembled is poised to bury mankind in a tomb of terror. Destroying His legions will be the supreme challenge for the mightiest warrior.
100 years before Simon Belmont's birth, Dracula is young at heart and it will take more than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of Trevor - Simon's forefather and the original vampire slayer.

Super Castlevania (1991/US, 1992/EU) SNES
A century of Transylvanian tranquility is about to come to a shocking end. Once again the mortifying screams of helpless villagers shake the ground as they shrink from new horrors unleashed by the Duke of Darkness, Count Dracula. And this time he has a tombstone with your name on it, Simon Belmont.

Castlevania The Adventure (1989/US, 1991/EU) GB
This is the first title in the series to be released on the Game Boy handheld game console.
The variety of power-ups available for the whip added depth to the strategy of the gameplay.

Castlevania Belmont's Revenge (1991/US, 1992/EU) GB
Fifteen years after vanquishing the evil Count Dracula, Christopher Belmont now faces a vampire swearing vengeance. Drac's back. And he's turned your son, Soleil Belmont, into a deadly demon to do his dirty deeds. To rescue him from the Count's clutches, you must first track him down through four creep packed castles.

Castlevania Bloodlines (1994) GEN
Unlike the medieval setting of the other titles, this installment takes place during World War I. It introduces new elements to the series, such as the ability to choose one of two characters when starting the game.
Huge bosses with dynamic, multi-jointed limbs that move erratically are just one of the many examples of the cutting-edge effects the game had for the time.

Kid Dracula (1990/Japan exclusive) NES
With its laugh-inducing content and world full of gags, this spinoff is unlike anything else in the series. Players take control of Dracula's son (or so he says...), Kid Dracula, as he goes on a hilarious adventure filled with laughs that also satisfies as a full-fledged action game.

El Hijo: A Wild West Tale is an exciting spaghetti-western stealth game, in which you guide a 6-year-old boy on his quest to find his mother.

As a six-year-old, ""El Hijo"" must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence and cunning and with it more schemes to get past his foes. On his journey, he will find himself in a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy.

The journey begins when a farmer and her son El Hijo are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave ""El Hijo"" at a secluded monastery in order to protect him. However, El Hijo decides that the monastic life is not for him and decides to escape. ""El Hijo - A Wild West Tale"" is a non-violent stealth game. Violence is instead exchanged with the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Shadowplay is in the core of the game and ""El Hijo"" will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined with each other to increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that ""El Hijo"" must traverse to reach his ultimate goal.

The player is equipped with a pair of special gloves that allow them to change the magnetic and gravitational properties of experimental cubes scattered around each level. These cubes can be moved by the player, either carrying them bodily or using magnetism or gravity. They can also be placed on teleporting machines to warp them to another teleporter and help solve puzzles. Mechanics really come alive when combined in ingenious ways. For instance, magnetism can be used to repel or attract cubes, but repelling a cube that has previously “anti-gravitated” gives you a frictionless device that will retain inertia until it collides against something solid, like a wall (or your skull). It can even be used as a means of transport for the player to reach new places. Cubes can also be used to power up some devices, in order to operate doors and force fields. As the player progresses towards more complex puzzles, they will encounter other devices - magnetic plates, elevators, buttons or even drones capable of nullifying magnetic and gravitational fields as well as stealing cubes.

In a disorganized and ghostly city, those foolish, desperate, or unlucky enough to walk the streets lay prey to Britain’s most elusive predators: the vampires. Emerging from the chaos, a tormented figure awakens. You are Jonathan E. Reid, a high-ranking military surgeon transformed into a vampire upon his return home from the frontline. Explore the darkly atmospheric streets of early 20th century London, and interact with a multitude of characters with their own identities and importance. Accept and fulfill the missions they give you, but don’t forget: sooner or later, you will have to feed, and make a difficult choice... who will be your prey? Absolutely all characters in the game are potential victims of your vampiric lust. Carefully study the habits of your next victim, his or her relationships with other characters, and set up your strategy to feed, unnoticed: seduce them, change their daily habits, or make sure they end up alone in a dark street… Be careful who you choose to hunt, as they will be gone forever, and their death will impact in a meaningful way the world that surrounds you. Feeding on human blood will not just keep you 'alive;' it will also unlock new vampiric powers to use.

* Evolving & Emergent Gameplay - Carve your path through an ever-changing landscape as you improvise your combat tactics - mixing gameplay styles, vehicles, weapons and explosives to defeat the EDF.

Watch as this nostalgic yet completely reimagined storybook world unravels before your very eyes. Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name. Don't be fooledthis picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown!

Story

A long time ago...

In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none.
The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun.
...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames,
a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim.

The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine.
Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign.
And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand.
While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned.

In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair.
To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware.

Gameplay
Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy!

Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins.

In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use theseand moreto your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm!

In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy!

Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it!

Beware the shadows and the darkness which seem silent. Beware the closed doors, the whispering mirrors. Beware the Song of Horror that nests in the cracks of your mind.

The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible and it's still somewhere, out there, lurking in the shadows, waiting for you... You may die, but the horror continues others will pick the investigation up from where you left it until you all find out the origin of The Presence and put an end to this nightmare.
A PARANORMAL ADVENTURE OF UNPREDICTABLE TERROR
Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience: its antagonist, the supernatural entity known only as The Presence, is controlled by an advanced AI (Artificial Intelligence) that adapts to your actions and decisions. Experience unbearable fear as this otherworldly being responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences.

As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain.

SPOOKY CHARACTERISTICS:

* Investigate a paranormal mystery in a thrilling story of psychological horror
* Beware The Presence, an otherworldly entity with its own AI that reacts to your actions and decisions in a non-scripted, unpredictable horror experience
* Choose between a group of unique characters: each one brings its own point of view and has a different relation to the story and other characters
* You may die, but the horror continues: death is permanent when a character dies, it's gone...but the next one will follow the investigation from where the deceased left it. The world will be shaped by their previous actions.
* Explore haunted, sinister locations to gather clues and items that will help you solve challenging puzzles while enduring the agonizing tension of the game's atmosphere Collapse",67,mixed or average reviews,14,5,7,2,7.3,mixed or average reviews,19.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,"Action Adventure, Survival",No Online Multiplayer,M,"#86 Best PS4 Game of 2021

Set in a drug-fuelled, retrofuturistic city in an alternative 1960s England, youll have to blend in with its other inhabitants, who dont take kindly to people who dont abide by their not-so-normal rules.

***1960s Dystopian England***
Set in a retrofuturistic 1960s, you will find a city ravaged by war and rebuilt by delusionally happy people. Everything appears to be happy in Wellington Wells, including the roads, the people, and its omnipresent television personality, Uncle Jack! However, its a beautiful world on the brink of collapse. You will discover the history of this world, and how it came to be just so beguilingly happy.

***Suspicion and Joy***
We Happy Few is about surviving in and escaping from a procedurally generated world, where you must learn to hide in plain sight. If you act out of turn, or youre not on Joy (the local happy pills), the locals will become suspicious and will rapidly turn your frown upside down! Forcefully. You will need to practice conformity, stealth and combat if you want to survive long enough to escape.

***A Mature Story***
We Happy Fews characters are not typical video game heroes. They are flawed and not particularly heroic, warped by the trauma their world has been through. Each character has their own storyline that reacts to the events of the world around them, and their place within it. Our stories are definitely not appropriate for children, but are laced with dark humour, hope, and even a spot of redemption.

***Features***
In We Happy Few, you will experience:
- A procedurally generated world, meaning that everyones experience will be unique,
- A range of difficulties for new and experienced players alike,
- Permadeath, if you want to satisfy all your masochistic needs,
- Three modes: sandbox, story and Wellie mode,
- A unique soundtrack, and
- A fully voiced, cinematic, first person story.

And you can play it in your own style:
- Fill your basic needs (hunger, thirst, and sleep) to survive,
- Learn how to interact with the other members of your society, and choose stealth, conformity or combat,
- Encounter dozens of in-game unique events,
- Conform to the specific local habits by learning to behave accordingly, and taking your Joy,
- Collect recipes, scavenge items and craft dozens of weapons, tools and devices,
fight with your bare hands or the crazy weapons you create,

Failing to find any signs of life, a young sword-wielding warrior named ‘Age’ falls down from orbit to Earth. Accompanied by his floating android, Helvis, he must find the indispensable key to the survival of humankind.

Uncover the chilling mysteries of this RPG-investigation game, descending deep into a world of cosmic horrors, creeping madness, and shrouded Old Gods within Lovecraft's iconic universe.

The Cthulhu Mythos has been fascinating audiences for generations, growing to become one of the largest shared universes ever envisioned and giving birth to countless stories, novels, movies, tabletop and videogames since the original publication of H.P. Lovecraft's The Call of Cthulhu. Adaptions and references have formed a widespread legacy stretching back to the very beginning of the 20th century, latching on to the key fear of the human psyche: that of the unknown. Now, Call of Cthulhu will bring the mythos to life like never before, on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.

In this world, nothing is as it seems. Sanity is an irregular bedfellow, all too often replaced by the whisperings in the dark. Strange creatures, weird science, and shadowy cults dominate the Cthulhu Mythos, intent on realizing their mad schemes to bring about the end of everything. Your mind will suffer -- balancing a razor-thin line between sanity and madness, your senses will be disrupted until you question the reality of everything around you. Trust no one. Creeping shadows hide lurking figures... and all the while, the Great Dreamer prepares for his awakening.

In addition to the arcade controls, the return of 3-Click swings appeals to nostalgic gamers who prefer to set power and accuracy by tapping a button rather than moving a thumbstick. Those looking for an extra challenge can turn on Tour settings. When playing with Tour controls, the length of your backswing and speed of your follow through determine power, while the club path through the ball will be the most important factor in accounting for accuracy. Fans can also mix and match all three settings to create their own custom gameplay style. Courses themselves also affect how your shots are played, as firmer, links-style courses like St. Andrews provides more bounce and roll, while softer courses such as TPC Sawgrass have less bounce and be more receptive to spin.

With a whole new story, and shifting to a pausable real-time tactical action style, players will be able to control the team strategically and tackle enemies and puzzles alike.

Fear Effect Sedna is set four years after the events of the original Fear Effect game, and things have changed for the team. Hana, freed from the Triad, lives with Rain in Hong Kong and works as an occasional mercenary, while Deke has grown apart from them since Glas returned to the US.

Hana accepts a small mission for a shadowy organization asking for her services. Her target: a mysterious ancient statuette held by the Chinese ambassador in France. She sees it as a good opportunity to visit her birthplace... But this 'easy' mission is about to lead Hana to something way bigger than she expected.

Meanwhile Glas is approached by a client who catches his attention enough that he soon sets out for Greenland.

How will these events bring the old team back together?

Fear Effect Sedna is dedicated to recreating the atmosphere and characters from the original Fear Effect. However, while there are familiar aspects of the game to previous incarnations of the franchise, you'll find yourself immersed in a completely unique and new world with Fear Effect Sedna - one that will appeal to fans both old and new.
Features:

* New environments in isometric view: Explore the deep caves of Greenland, abandoned scientific complexes, underwater stations and ethereal realms based on Inuit mythology.
* A real-time tactical action game: Exploit your heroes' special abilities and combine them to maximize your team's effectiveness in attacks.
* A deep and mature story: Learn more about Fear Effect's iconic characters' past as they delve into this new mystery.
