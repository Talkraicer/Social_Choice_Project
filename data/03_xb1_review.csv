red-dead-redemption-2,"Unquestionably 2018's best game, and an all-time open-world masterpiece. [Christmas 2018, p.89]","It doesn’t matter if you are gamer, a human being, or an alien from another planet; Red Dead Redemption 2 is a title that you just can’t miss. The bar set by RDR2 is so high that even Rockstar itself will probably have a hard time raising it. One of the best releases in the history of digital entertainment.","Red Dead Redemption 2 is technically impressive; a well-made game and a visual jewel polished to the smallest detail: a masterpiece in every way. By displaying excellent writing and storytelling, developed character and plots, and a full array of activities, it stands one of the best open worlds to date. Rockstar Games once again stands as the creator of the most successful and influential works in the medium of interactive entertainment. We are probably facing the best game ever made by Rockstar Games.","Red Dead Redemption 2 is likely to go down as the best game of the generation. Rockstar has outdone themselves, delivering one of the biggest, richest, most engrossing open world games ever made. Whether you're an action fan, RPG fan, open world fan, or just want a great story, RDR2 has something for everyone.","Red Dead Redemption 2 lives up to everything and more with what Rockstar Games have promised. More importantly, the gameplay is enjoyable and accessible, the story engaging and the characters are interesting, however what Rockstar Games have achieved is creating a truly interactive, immersive and massive open-world game that feels solid and you can almost imagine that you are part of this world.","Rockstar knows quality like no other. Developers across the world will be learning from Red Dead Redemption 2 for a great many years to come. The care and attention to detail within is second to none, and the depth throughout the entirety of the game’s stunning open world, as well as every component that it encompasses, is unrivaled. Simply put, Red Dead Redemption 2 is not just ambitious and revolutionary, it’s a masterpiece.","Red Dead Redemption 2's vast, detailed and stunningly beautiful open world sits as the perfect backdrop for its compelling and well-paced story filled with epic set pieces. With deeper gameplay mechanics, a larger cast of diverse and interesting characters to meet, and a wealth of content from side objectives to mini-games, RDR2 is a shining example of what makes Rockstar's games so special. It might have been a long eight-year wait for a follow-up to Red Dead Redemption, but it's been well worth it as the game may go down as the greatest of this generation. Few games have ever had as much hype around them as this one, and yet few have ever met and even exceeded their expectations in the way Red Dead Redemption 2 has.","By whatever standard you want to apply, Red Dead Redemption II doesn’t just build on the accomplishments of its already impressive predecessor, it eclipses them. Much like the first Red Dead Redemption was unquestionably one of the high-water marks of the last generation, Red Dead Redemption II will be remembered as one of the most impressive achievements of this one.","Red Dead Redemption 2 isn't just a masterwork with an unparalleled attention in details and world development, but a real new milestone in its genre, capable of further shortening the distance between movies and games, but without sacrificing gameplay and complexity. A game that everyone should play.","Red Dead Redemption 2 is Rockstar's greatest game to date. It's also their most mature game in every aspect: technical, narrative and playable. Its slow pace may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're patient, the reward is the most lively and thrilling world we've ever had in a videogame, in which everything is seamlessly integrated.",Red Dead Redemption 2 offers an unprecedented level of interaction with NPCs. Its level of detail and brilliant way of telling Arthur Morgan's story in a completely open adventure make the Rockstar game a masterpiece.,"Despite some minor issues like stuttering in interiors, awkward camera angles in smaller houses, or the relatively slow start to story the campaign — Red Dead Redemption 2 simply overrides its small perceptible flaws with what is nothing short of a truly spectacular experience. Simply put, it is one of the best games ever made, setting a new standard for open world titles going forward.","This place Rockstar has crafted; the dewy plains, the flowery meadows, the snowy mountains, the swampy Bayou, the dense Saint Denis -- all of it. I just wanted to exist as one with it and feel alive within it. And that’s what I did, and continue to do. Horseshit-riddled streets and all. Rockstar, my dusty old hat is off to you. You’ve made this old videogame cowboy a very happy camper.","Red Dead Redemption 2 delivers the goods in a way that very little else has done before it, or quite possibly will do again.","Thanks to both its shocking cruelty and its awe-inspiring potential, this stunningly well-realised recreation of the Wild West is the first game world that truly mirrors our own. Rockstar’s latest playground is a place that’s equal parts brutal and beautiful, and somehow, like in our own reality, the weight of your decisions in this game world have just as much potential to delight you as they do to terrify.","One of the top three open-worlds of all time, and the best game Rockstar has ever made. An all-time Old West masterpiece.","Red Dead Redemption 2 stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Grand Theft Auto V as one of the greatest games of the modern age. It’s a gorgeous depiction of an ugly period that’s patient, polished, and a huge amount of fun to play, and it’s combined with Rockstar’s best storytelling to date.",With Red Dead Redemption 2 Rockstar Games has set the bar so high that other games of this nature seem infinitesimally lesser because of its existence.,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is not only a masterpiece of design philosophy and open-world expertise. Is a whole new world for the videogame industry: it does things that are unprecedented in entertainment media, and it does them perfectly.","The years spent shaping Red Dead Redemption 2 into what it is has been worth it. Rockstar hasn't just created a video game; it has created as close to a living, breathing digital world as can be. It's not so much something that you play, it's something that you visit and experience. Something you willingly get lost in... This is the new benchmark by which open world games will be measured, but none will be meeting its heady heights anytime soon.","Red Dead Redemption 2 raises the bar for sandbox adventure games. It’s organic in a way almost unseen in any genre, creating an authentic open world that is as cohesive as it is compelling. This title will set the bar for action adventure games for years to come.","I wish there was more I could say about the game. There is so much to discuss, but that would take away from the experience. Avoid spoilers, avoid videos of this game, just buy it, play it, and fall in love with this world the same way I did.","Red Dead Redemption 2 is what we all expected and then some. The game delivers on the fantasy of living as an outlaw in the old west, and may be one of the best open-world games ever made.","Red Dead Redemption 2 offers a world and a story so well crafted that it sometimes makes you forget you're in a video game. It's an instant classic, that will be talked about for a long time to come.","Red Dead Redemption 2 may not be perfect, but its minor shortcomings are like tiny blemishes on a stunningly beautiful face. In a way, they only serve as a reminder of how this world isn't made for perfection. Every single aspect of the game will put you into the very shoes of an outlaw roaming America with his gang as they try to escape the law long enough to make the money needed to disappear for good. It's an epic, memorable and engrossing tale which also elevates the open world genre to new heights with the brand new interaction system, a cast of memorable characters and a ton of high-quality content to play for a long time.","A stunning, elegiac western that features some of Rockstar's best writing to date, Red Dead Redemption 2 is also the studio's finest open-world to date, handcrafted with real, tangible care and attention, defying the boundaries of what a video game can be. Arthur Morgan will also inhabit a special place in your heart, as a likeable, relatable rogue striving to find his way in the world. Good ol' Arthur.","With its amazing open-world, well-written story and deep characters, Red Dead Redemption II is a roller-coaster full of emotions. Controls may feel a bit clunky at times, but still: this is a masterpiece.","While it has some notable but minor flaws, it's hard to argue that Red Dead Redemption 2 is not a masterpiece. The end result of the meticulous detail, wonderful writing and stunning looks is an open world that sets a new bar for believability, and a time and place I can't stop thinking about or wanting to be a part of.","Red Dead Redemption 2 is an excellent prequel, but it's also an emotional, thought-provoking story in its own right, and it's a world that is hard to leave when it's done.","Few worlds are as well-realised as the one Rockstar has created for Red Dead Redemption 2. Thanks to some wonderful scripting and stellar performances, the characters you randomly meet in the wild are captured as well as the ones you spend most of your days around camp. How do you follow Red Dead Redemption? You make Red Dead Redemption 2.","Red Dead Redemption 2 was the first time playing a Rockstar game where my reaction went past interest to investment. I cared about what happened to these people, I cared about their stories and their lives, and there were moments where I was genuinely saddened or excited by what happened to them. And as the story winds toward its various conclusions, I was completely invested in them, hoping for the best, and fearing the worst. For someone there for the story, who wanted a game to feel fun more than they wanted it to feel comprehensive, I was completely absorbed.","Red Dead Redemption 2 is an enjoyable sequel that builds on the foundation of its predecessor, with much to do and plenty to see, all wrapped up in some of the best visuals you've ever seen on a console. With great characters and satisfying action, it's a Wild West worth exploring.","Red Dead Redemption 2’s missteps are few. The autosaving system is a little bit cruel, leading you to replay failed missions not from a pivotal point, but often from the very beginning of the mission or the section; the game should have taken cues from Ubisoft’s Far Cry and implemented far more friendly checkpoint saves. And while horseback riding in this game is largely fantastic, it’s odd to spend so much time tapping a button just to create your horse’s pace. This is intuitive -- but it feels unnecessary at times, too. The entire Red Dead experience, though, feels fantastic overall.","At its best, the story breaks away from the Western genre and plays like a cross between a heist movie, a domestic drama and a political thriller. At its worst, it’s a buddy action comedy. Mercifully, it manages to be more of the former than the latter.

grand-theft-auto-v,"So good that it almost seems deceitful: like a CG trailer of what the highest level of fun might look like. After 17 years, it's incredible that the series still has such power to astound and excite.",,"GTA V is back in Full HD, with higher detail, better textures, breathtaking lighting effects, impressive draw distance, a whole new first person view mode and 30 player multiplayer battles.",,,,,,"Rockstar shows all its mastery and care for detail even in a ""porting"" operation, delivering us a visually stunning and richer GTA experience and successfully introducing the new first-person camera, something we loved and would like to see in any Rockstar game from now on.",,,,One of gaming’s best and not to be missed.,,,,"I’m glad to have had a reason to revisit it, and am happy to find it even more impressive than it was before.",,,,,"Grand Theft Auto V is certainly more than worth your time, but the question is, do you want to spend another 30-50 hours in Los Santos, if you already made the trip last year? For me it is a resounding yes, as the new additions really drew me back into the world, and I had forgotten how much fun I had just exploring, planning heists and even hopping online with friends to cause havoc.",,,,"Over one year on and Grand Theft Auto V is still a stunning, unmatched achievement. An open-world that's still utterly absorbing, characters that you'll still want to spend time with and enough new stuff to drag you back for more, all conspire to make GTA V on new-gen entirely indispensable. Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.",,,,,,,,,"It’s just a great game tying to be even better. In some cases it works, in other cases it doesn’t. But, ultimately, if the idea of playing a superior version of one of the best games of all time appeals to you (and why wouldn’t it?) then this is a more than worthy excuse for a double-dip.","It doesn't matter if it's your first time visiting Los Santos or if you're thinking of booking a return flight, we give GTA V our highest recommendation. This is simply a marvelous game.","Rockstar did not have to try hard – GTA V would sell on new consoles even it was the same game as before. It’s hard to underestimate both their ambition and effort to make their latest offering something more than a simple reissue. The new first person view really changes the gameplay and alone is worth your money. [01/2015, p.36]","The real draw to return to fold, or jump in for the first time if you missed out on GTA V over the course of the last year, lies in the updated graphical prowess current-gen systems hold. Most significantly, the draw distance in this updated version is absolutely outstanding.","Grand Theft Auto 5 on the new platforms is a great comeback for the already impressive game. The first-person view mode, the enhanced visuals, and the many different smaller alterations transform the game into an even better experience. However, lingering problems with the gameplay and a few visual issues keep it from achieving perfection.","Exceptional game that looks phenomenal,especially from a new point of view. But do not expect a new experience-that comes only when you are a newcomer to the game.",This is more than a “definitive edition”. With all additions and improved visuals that didn’t leave a stone unturned even frequent visitors of past-gens Los Santos will find something that will make their return trip worthwhile. And if you didn’t play it yet: Welcome to open-world heaven.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain,"Long-term fans might feel sad that Kojima doesn't go out in a hail of meta-bullets, but his restraint lets those magnificent ideas breathe, resulting in one of the finest stealth games ever made. [Oct 2015, p.89]",,,,Metal Gear Solid V Phantom Pain is an interactive piece of art that truly pays homage to the original game and successfully expands the franchise into an open-world game.,,,,"Kojima managed to create the perfect open-world stealth game, giving the player an incredible freedom coupled with great depth and variety. MGS fans will probably dislike its sparse and somewhat unsatisfying storytelling, but it undoubtedly is a masterwork of game design.",,,,,,,,"Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain is a gameplay marvel, rewarding intelligence and creativity in a way few games do.","Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain will go down as the best-looking, best-playing, and most ambitious game in the series -- one that utilizes the new-gen hardware and the incredible Fox Engine to deliver both a visual masterpiece and more robust gameplay experience than its predecessors.",,,,"On one hand I love the game play. Building up Mother Base, the missions, the stealth and gunplay all feel so refined. The open-world sandbox is endless fun. The Metal Gear portion though sadly disappoints. The boss fights are lackluster, the cut scenes are not as wacky and outlandish as I expected, and the story never really grabbed me.",This is the Metal Gear universe as it was always meant to be.,,,,,,,,,,,,"A fantastic stealth action game that offers an insane amount of ways to play, just don't expect it to feel like your typical Metal Gear experience.",,,,,,,"Metal Gear Solid V is a game-changing triumph. It is comfortably the best stealth game yet made. But that accolade sells the game short. This is the final evolution of a video game director’s singular vision, one first painted in the crude pixels of the 1980s and now fully realised, fully resplendent.","With The Phantom Pain, Metal Gear has had its arm removed and replaced with something technically far more impressive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
celeste,,,,,,"Celeste offers a bold and beautiful story that will touch anyone who can relate to its plot foundation. It’s a brilliantly designed and gorgeously presented experience throughout the entirety of play. Perhaps Celeste’s greatest achievement, however, is that it appeals to speedrunners, thrill seekers, and completionists alike. Furthermore, it doesn’t alienate genre newcomers thanks to how accessible it is.","The frustration of dying for the thousandth time finds its counterweight in the gorgeously fluid ballet of a perfect run. With a wonderfully evocative soundtrack and a whole host of creative ideas and plenty of additional challenges beyond the main campaign, Celeste manages to cram in a whole lot of goodness without ever missing a step. Fans of tricky platformers will find much to love in the game's design, but it's also a perfect starting point for anyone new to the genre — perhaps even those actively averse to it. In short, it's a bit of a masterpiece.",,"Celeste surprised us with its tight and challenging but very rewarding gameplay, coupled with a deep story and great level design. Sometimes you can feel lost in the game's vast areas and it could have used a more diversified gameplay, but it's definitely a game to have for lovers of 2D platform games.","Celeste is ... like heaven. The level design is fantastic, artistically takes your breath away and playability is perfect. It's highly complicated, especially after the first round, but very satisfying. Celeste itself explains why ""indie games"" exist.",,,,"Celeste is undoubtedly a modern masterpiece. Its mix of reactionary platforming and problem solving is a breath of fresh air. Its Assist Mode is ahead of the curb in an industry constantly discussing accessibility. The way it masterfully weaves its emotional story about mental health with its brutal difficulty is astounding. Hours of extra content, one of the best soundtracks of all time and neat art is only the icing on the cake for this indie gem.",,,"The greatest triumph of Celeste is that its best-in-class jumping and dashing is blended beautifully with an important and sincere story and an incredible soundtrack that make it a genuinely emotional game, even when your feet are planted firmly on the ground.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Simply put, Celeste is a tour de force. A piece of work that will no doubt go down as one of the year’s best platformers or even just one of its best games in general. Between the immaculately crafted levels with a wide variety of challenges, the intense gameplay that rewards crackerjack timing, the sheer amount of post-game content and things to discover in every chapter, and a moving, amazing story in the form of Madeline’s urge to climb the behemoth that awaits her, what we have here is truly magnificent and an experience that simply cannot be missed. And hey, word has it that the view from the top is amazing.","Overall Celeste is a phenomenal game. While the game delivers on all fronts, the relatable story and soundtrack stand out as two of the most memorable aspects. The challenging platforming helps to keep the player motivated to push forward. The discussions between Madeline and side characters to the game help the world around you feel alive, and their guidance helps Madeline to continue pushing forward. Celeste is not a game for everyone. The difficulty alone is something to easily turn players away. To those who are looking for a challenging platformer with a rewarding story, Celeste is definitely a one of a kind diamond in the rough.","Developer Matt Makes Games’ previous release was TowerFall, the archery-themed four-player battle royale. With its single-player focus and touching narrative, Celeste might seem like an odd follow-up. However, like TowerFall, Celeste features polished and intense action that makes it easy to love and hard to put down.","The best indie platformer since Super Meat Boy, but also one of the best storytelling experiences of recent years – with an incisive and thoughtful portrayal of mental illness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
resident-evil-2,Perfectly captures the essence of the original while offering something completely new.,,,,A fan-faithful remake rebuilt from the ground up and jam-packed with quality content. A package both longtime Resident Evil fans and newbies will enjoy.,"Whether you’re returning to Raccoon City after a number of years, or, this is your first trip to the ill-fated locale, there’s no better way to experience Resident Evil 2 than this remake. While remaining true to the overall arc of the original game, everything here has been tweaked, updated, and twisted into a truly brilliant survival horror. One that proves that no one does it quite like Capcom. Make no mistake about it, this, is a must-have.",,,"A real horror masterwork, capable of great respect for its roots but at the same time offering us a fresh and modern take on Capcom's cult game. Great graphics, a tighter storytelling and an high replay value make Resident Evil 2 a game worth playing both by fans of the original game and everyone who never played it.","Capcom has done an incredible job with Resident Evil 2 remake. Gameplay is smooth and characters are realistic. Story changes feel like Resident Evil 2 is the same as always, but also something completely new. It's about time a survival horror game wins Game of The Year. And Resident Evil 2 deserves the title.",Resident evil 2 returns the best way it could possibly be. Capcom is establishing the groundwork for the franchise with this remake.,"I had high expectations for Resident Evil 2, and Capcom delivered. This is the best horror game on Xbox One today, and one of its best single-player experiences in general.","This is a solid game built off an old experience that brings videogame horror to the visual contemporary. It can be frustrating and grinding at times, but this is how games were designed and played back in the day. We just may have come too far for a presentation of this calibre to be tied to game-design so long lost. Plenty of value if you’re a survival-horror/horror fan, or just a Resident Evil fan, but for mine -- a brand new experience would have been more welcome.","Resident Evil 2 remake is a pure masterclass in game design. With ingenious puzzles, enjoyable gunplay and a captivating story to get stuck into, Resident Evil 2 shows just what has been missing from the survival horror genre in recent years and with the graphical prowess creating some truly frightening environments, this is one game that will live long in the memories of both newcomers and veteran horror enthusiasts.",,,Now THIS is how you remake a classic. Resident Evil 2 expertly reanimates the horrifying atmosphere and moments of extreme tension that made the original so revered.,"From top to bottom, Resident Evil 2 is a stellar achievement from a team that obviously loved the source material and went to great lengths to update and enhance it without losing that original magic.",,"This re-imagining of Resident Evil 2 is everything a Resident Evil fan could ask for, taking the series back to its roots without feeling old. It is single-player survival horror at its finest, and quite possibly the best Resident Evil game ever made.",,,,,,"After reinventing the series with Resident Evil VII, returning to Raccoon City to relive past glories proves more than welcome. Calling Resident Evil 2 a remake, however, almost seems reductive. It looks and plays like a brand-new game, prodding the nostalgia glands while delivering something that feels fresh. Resident Evil 2 is expertly executed and bloody sublime.","In spite of its progression carrying the weight of the years and its strongly cliche scenario, Resident Evil 2 remains an exciting game in its mode of thought, its inventiveness and its execution.","The new Resident Evil 2 is everything the original was; tense, scary, brilliant and filled with secrets and additional content to find. But it's also a game perfectly suited to 2019, not just because of its cutting edge look and sound; but because we don't get games like this anymore, and that's a shame.","Though Resident Evil 2 has its roots firmly in the past, it reworks the familiar horrors into something that feels brand new and all its own.",,,,"Quite simply, this is Resident Evil at its finest.","Outside of those interruptions, Resident Evil 2 is everything a video game remake should be. It’s faithful in tone and story to its source material, while updating a classic in meaningful ways. It’s exciting in the ways that Resident Evil used to be, when the games were driven not by explosive set pieces, but a constant sensation of high tension. [Polygon Recommends]",,,,,"Resident Evil 2 comes in 2019 in all the glory you'd expect from such a mammoth franchise, bringing players new and old the same magnificent story but with spine-chilling new graphics and mechanics that will make even those of you with nerves of steel to experience the occasional lift-off from your gaming couch. Nothing negative can be said regarding the game, except for the difficulty and sense of dread and helplessness you get sometimes, but then again, that is the recipe for a good survival-horror title!",,,,,,,,,"When old and new conventions meet this flawlessly, RE2 is a true celebration of sincere video gaming, an art that sometimes is lost among Western triple-A developers and their plodding and misshapen movie wannabes where the gameplay is secondary. If only all video games could be reverted back to this, a pureblood gaming pleasure but still look as amazing as Resident Evil 2. Capcom, how about the same gorgeous treatment for Resident Evil 3 next?","Resident Evil 2 takes a masterpiece and twists it until it resembles something completely new without betraying the spirit of the original. There’s some very, very minor cuts that’ll no doubt upset some fans; but these are ultimately unnoticeable as what Capcom has offered up is an absolute triumph. Resident Evil 2 provides a new way to experience a classic and a very welcome reminder that the old style of Resident Evil is not dead. If anything, it’s finally back.","The traditions of survival horror have been modernised, resulting in something that’s all-too-familiar yet always manages to keep you on your toes. The Raccoon City that you’ve always envisaged by filling in the blanks and making up for the failings of 32-bit graphics is now real.","This Resident Evil 2 doesn't replace or overwrite its source game in the way 2002's Resident Evil did, but that doesn't mean it's a bad remake. Rather, it's one of the best the medium has seen; amplifying the underlying horror and replayability at the core of the franchise. Capcom has outdone itself in an era where they're not hurting for successes. Not for the faint of heart, but a survival horror masterpiece nonetheless, Resident Evil 2 sets a standard for good horror, good action, and damn good game design.","Even with some inconsistencies between the scenarios, this game had a lot of time put into it and you should definitely pick it up if you enjoyed the original game. Fans of RE7 will really enjoy the remake since it nearly has the same type of gameplay (only with a third person camera). The remake does not outdo the original on every single level, but it definitely is the version that I'd choose to play from now on. No matter what flaws I point out, this game consists of so much win that the flaws get drowned out in the end.","A stellar remake, which is not afraid to change what it takes to update one of the most important video games of all time.",A classic of the survival horror genre re-built for the modern age. This is how a remake should always be done.,"Capcom has done an amazing job bringing RE2 back. It is a great game and a must-have for survival horror fans, although some of the design choices don’t work that well 20 years later and we wish they had worked harder on making the Claire and Leon scenarios more unique.","If one were to judge a horror title solely on its ability to suspend its audience in a state of dreadful tension, Resident Evil 2 would be quite accomplished.","It was a bold move for Capcom to retain as much of the original game as it did (which was most of it), and it speaks to a level of Nintendo-esque confidence in the basic design that the studio hasn’t really displayed in years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
inside,"We expected a brief, morbid adventure, but we never expected it to surpass Limbo. [Sept 2016, p.80]","By entering the world of Inside, you'll forget your own world and everything that's been going on in it. From beautiful art design to engaging gameplay, thrilling atmosphere to marvelous story, everything about this game is truly exceptional. Do not miss it.","Original, thoughtful, aesthetically pleasing and dark, Inside offers cool puzzles, a deep and meaningful context and a unique experience that every gamer should play. The only imperfection is a premature ending that stops Inside from developing all of its potential.",,Not only would I recommend playing this game I would put it under the category of required playing especially as it is very competitively priced for a game that has obviously had a huge amount of work put it to perfecting it.,,"Inside is a game that has to be experienced first-hand to be understood and I’d urge everyone to play it. At three to four hours it is on the short side, but thanks to the thought provoking and surprising story, tight gameplay and exceptional sound and visual design, Inside will leave a long lasting impression that will more than make it worth its price tag.","Basically, what I'm trying to say is that Inside excels in pretty much every way imaginable.","Playdead took everything they did well with Limbo and brought it to the next level, carefully crafting an incredibly meditative, unpredictable and mature adventure. With a flawless, clean and detailed artistic design and an incredible variety in gameplay, Inside is a real masterpiece that will repeatedly blow your mind. A must buy.",,,"The masterful art direction, polished and responsive physics, and blisteringly intuitive gameplay design elevated Inside far, far beyond my expectations – which were already pretty high. Inside is a masterpiece.","At some point you get the feeling Playdead maybe didn’t know how to solve their own mystery and the game wraps up in a messy, unusual and unsatisfying way.",,,"Whether or not it achieves the same touchstone status as Limbo, Inside is a spellbinding, haunting experience - one I don't intend to relive any time soon, but absolutely recommend.","Inside very clearly builds upon what made Limbo great, and in fact builds something greater. Its unimaginable twist may leave you dumbfounded, confused, and quite possibly speechless, but it will fuel heated discussion with your friends about its meaning, its message, and its intentions.","A great game from start to finish. Fans of indie titles, moody atmosphere, and/or puzzle platformers should grab Inside ASAP.","Compared to Limbo, Inside does not propose any innovations and does not evolve the gameplay in any way. The new Playdead game, however, is a fascinating adventure to play, with bated breath, from start to finish thanks to the wonderful setting full of mystery.","As a piece of commerce, it is incredibly brief and depending on how you value one over the other, when you decide to experience this masterpiece is up to you. However, make no mistake, Inside is a game I recommend that everyone play.","Inside is an incredible sophomore swing from Playdead, as the atmosphere, aesthetic and gameplay meld into one glorious experience that demands attention. Don’t read about it, don’t seek more, don’t ask questions — just clear your afternoon schedule and experience it.",,,,,,,,"This is a beautiful, haunting, and memorable game, a worthy follow-up to Limbo. Its puzzles, although rarely difficult, are engaging complements to the story. The real achievement of this game, though, is the way that it crafts its narrative: detailed environments convey the bizarre world that you travel through; introspective moments are filled with minimalist sound design and just the barest touches of music; and the things you must do to complete your journey force you to confront the realities of humanity, freedom, and existence.",Inside delights from start to finish. Don't miss out on what will surely be one of the best games of this generation.,,,"It's all an experience worth savoring and enjoying throughout the brief five-hour playtime. Much like Limbo before it, Inside is a simple game, utilizing classic tried-and-true mechanics to quietly tell a strong story.","Inside achieves something that Limbo didn't: It actually lives up to its opening moments, delivering astounding setpieces and an unforgettable final sequence. Those jaw-dropping last moments are a fitting endcap to this superbly crafted, beautiful game.",,,,,,,"It is definitely one of the most intense gaming experiences I was lucky enough to play in the last few years. With simplicity and atmosphere at its core, it took me on an emotional journey with an intensity and ruthlessness I didn’t expect.","Inside is constantly surprising, introducing new elements without ever overwhelming, maintaining an excellent pace over the course of about four hours.",,"Inside isn’t just some incremental improvement over the basic premise of Limbo, it’s one of the best puzzle-platformers ever made. From its brilliant puzzle design, which finds a way to balance constant progress and momentum with puzzles that require deep thought, to its gorgeous lighting effects, this is the type of game that demonstrates why the indie development scene is something special.",The prospect of not playing this game is far scarier than whatever Inside's ominous bad guys have planned for that poor little boy.,"My chest tightens as I recall the feeling of entering new areas, succumbing to surprise deaths and witnessing its many unexpected moments. By the end, I felt as though I had lived through someone’s horrible dream, and I couldn’t wait to do it all over again.","Visually though this is one of the most impressive games of the year, with the subtle animation and sparing use of colour telling you all you need to know about the situation without a word of dialogue. Inside isn’t a fun video game, but it is a clever and intelligent one. And despite how long it’s been since Limbo it’s telling that nobody has managed to perfect that formula as well as Playdead.",Inside takes an already great formula of and improves on it in just about every way. The beautifully designed environments coupled with the cleverly crafted puzzles easily makes this the indie game to beat this year.,,"Playdead has greatly improved how it delivers a story, but hasn’t moved away from ambiguity. The latter three-quarters of Inside cheapens the otherwise refined package, only saved because the studio is the undisputed master of horrific puzzles. Ending aside, it’s definitely worth a look.",,,A minimalistic yet excellent puzzle-platformer that achieves everything that it attempts almost perfectly. Only its slower pace and the lack of a real challenge could be improved.,"Playdead's Inside is a strange, freaky and compelling game. With stunning visuals and a graceful control scheme, it's a perfect, small, indie game.",Inside is the perfect evolution of Limbo. An unforgettable journey worth your time.,"The game is a procession of stately, grim exclamation marks. It is visionary art.","Discomfort is what Playdead has proven itself to be best at creating. The studio understands that there’s disquiet in the unknown and the undefined, and that what’s unheard and unseen can be even more powerful than what’s right in front of us. This is a philosophy that informs Inside’s every trait, from its ambiguous narrative to its uncomplicated character designs and fragile soundscapes. What really cements the developer’s prowess is the finale, a shocking sequence that proves Playdead is just as capable of recognizing when to break free of those restraints as it is knowing when to apply them.","Playdead's Inside is one of those rare games that has to be experienced first hand in order to understand its importance. Rest assured, you'd be hard pressed to find another game that's equally brilliant and beautiful.","Inside is a masterpiece waiting to be played and a worthy successor to Limbo that is just as thought-provoking, if not more. Playing through even one section of the game, the amount of polish and attention to detail is apparent. Not many games stick with me after the credits roll, but Inside is one of those rare few.","When a game has a perfect level design, an almost perfect character design and a fantastic narrative with an amazing atmosphere it results in one of the most fascinating games I've played in recent years. And that game is called Inside.","It took Playdead almost six years to put out their follow-up to Limbo, and that time certainly was put to good use. It’s world is simultaneously macabre and filled with heart.","Much like Limbo, Inside also has a timeless quality to it and is yet another must-play experience from Playdead.",It’s a rare game that keeps you ruminating over the meaning of its background elements long after you’ve finished playing it. It’s also a rare game that demonstrates exactly what the medium as a whole is capable of. Do not wait: play it...Inside is absolutely astonishing.,"Playdead could have simply made yet another 'Limbo' and it would've been great. Instead, they kept the core gameplay and went into a bold yet familiar direction with it. 'Inside' hasn't left my thoughts since I completed it, and I doubt it will any time soon. It's a fantastic game that proves what the medium can do when used correctly, and provides an experience that can't be replicated by film or literature.","Describing Inside is difficult, not because one can’t find the words, but because it has to be seen to truly be believed.","It's rare that a game can be beautiful, gruesome, tense and exhilarating all at the same time, but Inside does just that. Its six years in the making really show. It might be just a sidescroller on paper, but it's so polished and well-put-together that its a showcase of Playdead's mastery. It's captivating and moving, gory and bleak but ultimately, Inside is a piece of art from the first stumbling steps to the closing credits.","Playdead's Inside is fiercely intelligent, exquisitely grotesque - and one of the best video games of the year.","Gameplay wise, the game is constantly changing and surprising you with fresh ideas...An exceptional game.",Brings to fruition whatever Playdead’s designers were scratching at six years ago...This now feels like where Limbo was headed all along. I’m just grateful Playdead has been afforded the chance to bring us there.,"Inside is one of those games that can mark you for life. Walking in the footsteps of Limbo, it builds its own identity in a beautiful way and improve the formula in absolutely everything we had already fell in love with just a few years ago.","Combine a highly compelling visual narrative with superb puzzles and brilliant platforming, and you have Inside, one of the most intriguing, addictive, and beautiful-looking games of this generation. Its only downside is that it's quite short, but while it lasts, it's absolutely glorious.","Inside expands on the concepts and scope of its predecessor in wildly creative ways, and it's so immaculately designed and constructed from top to bottom that it almost feels suitable for display in an art museum. This is one hell of a followup.","A masterpiece. The new game from Limbo's creators is an experience that everyone should try. Epic story, beautiful art work, perfect level design and terrific gameplay mechanics are just some elements that makes this game a contender for Game of the Year.",Playdead did it again and created a masterpiece which manages to surpass the masterpiece of Limbo in every possible way. We don’t believe a higher praise could be said for their second game.,Inside is an incredibly and thought provoking experience from start to finish and a game that I won't soon forget.,Quotation forthcoming.,"Inside is a game that simply has to be experienced. Its mystery filled dystopian world is brought to life expertly through tight, thoughtful design, masterful art direction and sublime sound design. Inside isn’t like many other games, because not many others can do so perfectly what it does regularly.","Inside is a perfect videogame. Is impeccable in terms of narration, gameplay, game design and style. Is a thrilling and painful adventure, an unforgettable experience you cannot miss.","Haunting, bizarre, atmospheric… Brilliant. Playdead’s new game is better than Limbo, and achieves an amazing and terrifying vision of a dark and disturbing world.","Inside stands on its own merits as a superbly captivating and moving experience, one that's bound to be on your mind in the time you spend away from it.","Inside is a brilliantly crafted game that will keep you talking about it long after you’ve finished playing. Its moody, atmospheric world and terrific puzzle-platforming are simply the hooks to first draw you in.","The most haunting and affecting game of the year. [Sept 2016, p.76]","Inside's quiet confidence is a maneuver invented to not only disarm the player, but also destabilize assumptions that seem inseparable from an entire class of games. Plenty of games have pulled the curtain away to thunderous applause. Only Inside has room for shock, panic, and the inconceivable notion that the nightmare isn't yet over.","Inside shows that Playdead has a knack for the short but powerful puzzle-platformer. The puzzles are logical and challenging, while the story is told well without a reliance on the usual things like dialogue and cut scenes. The balance between both creates a game that has a ton of memorable moments, and the flow is smooth enough that you're compelled to keep playing until you reach the thought-provoking ending. With a presentation that adds greatly to the narrative, Inside is well worth your time.","Inside may require thought, care and occasionally a sharp sense of timing to progress, but its obstacles never feel unfair. [Issue#296, p.120]","Dark, sombre and thoughtful, Inside is a brief experience that's satisfying in the questions it creates.","Inside is a rarity, both in terms of its ambitions and its construction.","Inside is a short but amazing trip through a broken world. It offers not only entertaining and logical puzzles, but also a story that is as tragic as it is bizarre. The fluent animations are the cherries on top of this tasty platform cake.","Inside is an incredible game, a compelling artistic achievement that deserves your time no matter what genre of game you normally prefer. I [wish] there was a tiny bit more to it, but between the gameplay, the animation and the atmosphere, it’s enough to be a worthwhile experience, and one you won’t forget for a good long time to come.","Inside is not for those looking for hours of fun, opting instead to channel the ‘games as art’ mentality that has been debated into the dirt. It’s a game that people will be trying to figure out the meaning to for months to come.","As phenomenal of an experience as Limbo was, Playdead somehow managed to top it with Inside. It’s a hauntingly beautiful game, especially for how violent and dark it turns by the end. The mechanics, while simple, really cause you to stop and think how all the elements of a puzzle should work together. Although it’s a rather short experience, Inside will undoubtedly keep you thinking hours after you’ve seen the credits roll. You’ll definitely be pondering the implications of what happened, and it’ll make you eager to replay it in case you might have missed anything.","Inside is an artistic triumph. Video games, at their best, fold their various components into a whole that is far greater than the sum of their parts. Inside does exactly that, and more so does exactly what its name implies: it gets in your head, in your system, and stays there.","After LIMBO, INSIDE is another masterpiece from Playdead. Maybe not that innovative with its gameplay, this new game is above all a great performance when it comes to setting an atmosphere and telling a story without saying a word. And, yes, it's beautiful.","Inside builds on every strength of Playdead’s Limbo, while also delivering a compelling yet haunting world filled with smart puzzles and inventive mechanics.","Masterpiece? Whatever you call it, it's a game that will blow your mind. And that's totally worth the ride.","I can imagine some players being disappointed that Inside is perhaps a bit too much like Limbo. From both games’ dark themes and imagery to the sorts of puzzles they offer up, there are plenty of lines to be drawn between them.",It's an astonishing conclusion as haunting and evocative as anything you'll see in a game this year.,"INSIDE is a top quality product that will let you enjoy a great journey, as amazing as overwhelming, where the excellent visual language drawn by Playdead is the key feature making the story absolutely special. INSIDE is the umpteenth piece of proof that an actually ""different"" game can be crafted with simple and functional ideas, with neither cut-scenes misuse nor fancy narrative techniques. Even the poor longevity get overshadowed: INSIDE offers an experience that only asks to be lived, not for the quantity but for the high quality of its content.","Inside is not only one of the best indie games in a long time, it might as well be the best game of 2016, so far. With beautiful design and an interesting story, Playdead manages to deliver a platform adventure that won't leave anyone untouched.",Inside is one of the best games of this year so far. The puzzles are fantastic and overall it's a very addictive game.,"Although not the breakthrough that was Limboback in 2010, Inside is nonetheless a beautifully-crafted refinement of that experience.",Playdead’s greatest feat in creating Inside was making it look like they never created it in the first place.,"Inside is a enormously atmospheric platformer with puzzles, with a great graphical style, and it's thrilling until the end.","If you even remotely enjoyed Limbo, you'll feel right at home with Inside.","Ultimately, if you enjoy dark games with a healthy dose of problem-solving and/or you enjoyed Limbo, then you’ll definitely enjoy Inside as well!","Its vividly depressing, yet wondrous world proves that Playdead is still the master of atmospheric side-scrolling platformers, and it quickly became one of the best games I’ve played this year.","Inside recounts the journey of a young boy in a dark, mysterious and aesthetically significant gaming world. It’s an excellent puzzle platformer, able to convey emotions like fear and doubt, and it stimulates the player’s observation.","Set an evening aside where you immerse yourself in this living painting, and enjoy every single detail.","While it doesn't stray far from the template Limbo set, Inside is a gorgeous, beautifully directed puzzle platformer that you'll want to see through to the end.","Fun, easy, creepy, scary, bizarre, and oozing with atmosphere, but doesn’t quite stick the landing.","Inside is short but immensely interesting, telling its story almost like a silent movie, without words. Playday has once again managed to create something unique, a game that stays with us for hours after finishing the story.","Inside is an easy recommendation if you loved Limbo, but the abrupt ending is a bit of a bummer.","Inside, from the makers of Limbo, is just like its predecessor - truly amazing to explore. The beautiful atmosphere and the intriguing themes are interesting, even though the game is fairly short and does not succeed in being very challenging.","Just be warned: Inside will not win you over purely as a puzzle-platformer. The game is divided evenly into four types of play: no-challenge traversal; obvious puzzles; annoying head-scratchers; and truly clever challenges. Like Limbo, Inside limits your control to running, jumping, and an open-ended ""interact"" button. Sometimes, that button lets you push boxes or climb ropes. Other times, its functionality opens up the game's best and weirdest moments.","Inside defies expectations and delivers plenty of surprises. It's a triumph in storytelling, atmosphere and design. It's never boring or redundant and yet at the same time it's crafted with such a beautiful sense of style and feeling.",It doesn't have an Important Message to deliver and it's not openly political or overbearing about driving home underlying themes. It's just an expertly crafted story that — through clever design and eye-catching art — propels you from one terrible discovery to the next.,"Inside, like the studio’s freshman effort, is again a monochromatic, tense, haunting, side-scrolling puzzle game, but with six years of effort under its belt, Playdead now delivers a masterclass in its form.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But aside from that, the core racing experience, the thrill of driving recklessly through fields, cobblestone fences, city streets, and sandy beaches…it’s darn near unmatched in current racing games.

Playground Games hasn’t just upped the ante once again; it’s blown the bloody doors off.","Forza Horizon 4 is likely the best looking and most robust game in the series, even if Forza fatigue is beginning to set in with only slight changes to the established formula in this release.","Playground Games has gone further, improving the already huge third chapter in every single component. The dynamic seasons, the shared world, the magnificent graphics and the fulfilling driving model are enough to wipe out the competition and make Forza Horizon 4 a must buy for all Xbox One and PC owners.","Forza Horizon 4 feels like a labour of love; a game for car lovers by car lovers. But also, it's an engrossing experience that's rewarding every step of the way. Exploring the map feels just as worthwhile as completing events.

I mean there is absolutely nothing wrong with so many aspects of this title. It is polished, fun, smooth, and gorgeous. I think I am just growing tired of its structure. Still it feels like this title may see more updates than any previous entry. It has dozens of hours of content already packed into it. It is visually stunning and a blast to play with friends. It is hard not to love what Horizon 4 does.",,,,"Building upon everything that has continued to mark out the Forza Horizon series as something special and unique its own right - beyond being Forza Motorsport's carefree sibling - Forza Horizon 4 demonstrates once again just how recklessly entertaining driving roughshod across an open environment can be.

what-remains-of-edith-finch,"A beautiful and haunting exploration of life, death and family tragedy.",,,,,,"The exceptional story and inventive gameplay design makes Giant Sparrow's title a memorable trailblazer for walking sims. It sets a new bar for what the genre is capable of in its interactivity, and all narrative adventure games that arrive after Edith Finch may now have to consider challenging players with more than diary reading and tape playing. It's said that, in their infancy, each new medium copies the one it's following. In some ways, games are the successor to movies and we've seen plenty of cinematic games that crib the format of feature films. To take nothing away from such games, What Remains of Edith Finch is a shining example of what video games do uniquely well.",,"A game driving us through a roller-coaster of emotions while exploring adult and tragic stories, narrated with exceptional sensitivity and humanity. A game you can't miss if you love story-driven experiences.",,"One of the most honest approaches to death ever made in videogames.

Stunning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"What Remains of Edith Finch is an absolutely beautiful and emotionally complex game. Despite a certain sense of morbidity in telling so many tales of death, the game is truly about the celebration of life. Despite all their differences, each family member is remembered more for who they were than how they were lost. This is a wonderful little tale that uses every second to the fullest, and truly should not be missed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"What Remains of Edith Finch knows its niche from the beginning and rarely strays, resulting in a cohesive experience that I was never jolted out of.

Is impressive, difficult and technically amazing, but short.",,"In short, because it’s short, you get a more bite-sized piece of the whole Cuphead experience, but its upped challenge sort of makes up for that. I definitely found myself banging my head against the wall, which was to be expected, I just hadn’t wanted to be getting that headache so early on in the piece. It didn’t stop me from keeping on going though, which should give you an idea of the draw and pull here. Part tantalisation, part revenge, all in good fun. Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course has certainly sated my hunger and I only hope that while this is meant to be the last service here, that the kitchen isn’t closed for good.","What has been created in Cuphead - The Delicious Last Course is beautiful to behold, the right side (just) of frustratingly hard, and will keep you playing for a while, all as you spend time with Ms. Chalice and work with the new weapons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For years our appetite grew for the Cuphead expansion, and while The Delicious Last Course can be gobbled up within a few hours, it was definitely worth the wait. The love and passion that is within every thread of the creation are evident throughout and make each moment a pleasure to play.

The expressive jazz score and the faithful design help to make this finger-licking dollop of DLC an absolute masterpiece.",,,,,,,,"The Delicious Last Course is an almost perfect extension.

Everyone should at least see if not play this expansion, it is truly wonderful.","A brilliant new playable character makes re-experiencing the beautiful brutality of Cuphead a worthwhile prospect. The expertly designed bosses are a delight, even if the experience ends up being a bit of snack rather than a full meal.","Those who enjoyed and have missed the controller-throwing fury of Cuphead will be happy with the Delicious Last Course. It's a wholesome story, features more of the vintage art style that made the original so memorable, and the addition of Ms. Chalice even makes the base game retroactively more accessible.","Cuphead is a demanding game, and the Last Delicious Course is just as tortuous. The new gameplay, courtesy of Ms Chalice's arrival, provides the opportunity to encounter new and even more fearsome bosses. The addition of new weapons and charms also gives the base game a second breath. The art direction and soundtrack are as effective as ever.

We find the themes that are dear to Yuji Hori as well as the artistic direction that makes the charm of the series. Unassailable in its content, this ultimate edition does not revolutionize the formula but relies on solid mechanics.

Square-Enix perfects one of his most representative works, putting together an immense JRPG, rich of contents and with many, small filings that improve infinitely the fruition. Last but not least, compared to the eleventh standard episode, this special version also finds a shining technical aspect, thanks to a graphics rich of elements, with an exquisite design and a granitic frame-rate.

It keeps some of the technical sacrifices of the Switch version, but they can’t take away the greatness of this adventure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"At least as regards the playful and narrative component, the re-edition for PC and home console of Dragon Quest XI S is confirmed as a product of impeccable quality. Being a port of the Switch version, the graphic compromises have remained almost unchanged, but this time the title compensates for its artistic shortcomings with a doubled frame rate, almost zero loading times and a resolution finally in 4k, which consequently guarantee very high performance level.","A great JRPG you should play if you would like to live a great and classic adventure. Unfortunately, this edition is a graphic port from Nintendo Switch, so it doesn't shine like the original release.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The huge amount of features makes this game one of the most content-packed, varied, enjoyable RPGs ever...

At times they are dark and eerie and can rival a Survival Horror game. Exploration is very rewarding and fun. The enemies have personality, are well thought, varied and their design is very imaginative. The combat system is deep, addictive and difficult to master, maybe too much for the average gamer, but very rewarding for those who like difficult games and put the time and effort to get good and learn from their many deaths. I really enjoyed my time with this masterpiece and it reminded me why I love videogames.",,,"Sekiro is quite simply outstanding. It’s stunning, it’s deep, it’s diverse, and it’s wholly engaging across all aspects of play. However, what truly speaks volumes is the developer’s ability to constantly encourage its players’ capacity for improvement. Here, in Shadows Die Twice, due to its punishing difficulty alone, you’re either all in or you’re all out. If you’re of the latter, you’re missing out on what may well be one of the best games of 2019.",,,"From Software mixes well-proven and new gameplay elements to deliver an incredibly challenging and satisfying game, within a captivating Asian environment. It could have been bett-optimized and it's a pity it can't reach 60 fps on Xbox One X, but this undoubtedly is a must-have for all lovers of skill-demanding action games.","It's obvious that this is not a samurai skin over a Dark Souls game. It's more than that. It's a new rebirth that will delight Miyazaki-san followers and that will only be mastered by those who display their utmost skill and patience. It's a game that really penalizes mistakes. A game where you have to learn the behaviour of the enemies you face and be constantly adapting to take on the next challenge. And of course it's a very difficult game, a very big one.",With this game Miyazaki puts the player back to the test with what only he knows how to do: increasing to the maximum that feeling of reward by finishing an area that has put you on the ropes.,"I've spent roughly fifty hours with the game, and there's still so much to do. Sekiro is a captivating experience given its setting and lore. There are so many mysteries to uncover, and I can't wait to play it even more...It's definitely harder than Dark Souls, but the sense of satisfaction you feel after defeating powerful titans is a reward in itself. The more you play, the stronger you become.","If, like me, you’ve always just shied from games that punish for the sake of punishing, but thoroughly enjoy a story with mystery, excellent dialogue and unique fantastical components, Sekiro will punish, but it will also deliver in damascus folds. Folds upon folds. Prepare to die though, and much more than twice.","Everyone knows FromSoftware make hard games, and Sekiro is certainly no different. If anything, it may be even harder than those which have come before it. So, for newcomers it may not be the best ‘entry’ point to these types of games but if you have more than a passing interest in Soulsborne games, then Sekiro is definitely another one to add to this ever-growing list.","It is the best SoulsBorne game since the original Dark Souls, a tremendous victory lap for the genre that pushes the series in a fascinating direction, revitalizing its most stale features and introducing bold new ones.",,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a stylish, focused stealth-action take on the FromSoftware formula that evolves in a different and refreshing direction. It may be a bit easier than a Souls game, but it’s something amazing all its own.","Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a truly new expression of the design philosophy that FromSoftware has spent years refining. Shifting gears a bit in the setting, story, and gameplay, the spirit of Dark Souls is still clearly the driving factor here.",,,,,,,,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is effectively the offspring of what would happen if Dark Souls and Tenchu got frisky under the covers on a weekend trip out to the lake.

It’s just a shame that FromSoftware still hasn’t fixed the camera issues and shonky lock-on system a whole ten years after the first Souls game.","Doubt no more: From Sekiro is a true From Software game, demanding and technical.

It successfully manages to strike a delectable balance between difficult and enjoyable, without the frustrating moments players might’ve experienced in Dark Souls or Bloodborne. Owing to its fast-paced combat that rewards an aggressive approach, Sekiro is both fulfilling and satisfying and easily the best of FromSoftware’s games yet.",,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is the breath of fresh air the ""Soulsborne"" sub-genre needed. It proves that stats, levelling-up, and equipment, is not what makes this kind of games. Instead, what matters is how death is treated, what sort of consequences there are for choices the player makes, and really big doors that open dramatically slow. The verticality of the level design, grappling hook, jumping and almost Zelda-style progression makes this one stand out in an ever increasing sea of imitators. Ultimately, this is more than just a sum of its parts; it's full of mystery, jaw-dropping spectacle and intense satisfaction.",,An outstanding game that take the essence on the Soulsborne games and brings it forward to make one of the most compelling game experiences that we have played in a while.,,,My first ten hours with Sekiro reminded me of my first ten hours with “Demon’s Souls.” Its steep learning curve stared me in the face like a foreboding mountain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice will try your patience. As you might expect given its developer, it’s a devastatingly difficult game that will require your skill and concentration.

All told, it’s the best game I’ve ever hated, and I never want to play it again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The combination of classic action titles with the Dark Souls formula is truly phenomenal. Sekiro shows that there is room for complex games, although the high degree of difficulty is likely to discourage many.",,"Sekiro is a great game. Despite my complaints with its boss fights and the elimination of the equipment system Dark Souls was known for, it was a challenging and exciting adventure through Feudal Japan. If you’re a From Software fan, it’s a must-buy game, even with the changes, and it’s a decent place to start even if you’ve never played a From game before. However, Sekiro is far from perfection.",,,,,,,,,,,"Sekiro is without a doubt a powerful, timeless addition to Miyazaki's legendary collection of difficult but amazingly satisfying action RPG's, something that fans of Dark Souls will be very happy with. We have to be honest though, Nioh is a stronger Sengoku-game then Sekiro and we miss some of the usual From Software variation.",,,,,,,,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is one of the best games to emerge this year, adding yet another masterpiece to FromSoftware’s formidable catalogue of grim, uncompromising experiences. Nearly every encounter feels like a nuanced session of cat-and-mouse as you dance alongside the enemy, culminating in a final act that leaves them in a puddle of their own defeat.","Going in to this review I wasn’t sure if Sekiro was going to be simply a ninja re-skin of Dark Souls, but there’s more than enough that’s different, and improved, that it stands on its own within the genre, even if it’s from the same developers. Like every other FromSoftware title, the difficulty is either going to be what drives you to become better, or make you shy away. I believe that Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is going to be on many Game of the Year lists for 2019, and for good reason.","It’s a game that asks you to succeed on your own and creates an intimate, engaging experience as a result. Oh, and you can pause the game to use items or take a breather this time around, because really, the game doesn’t need to be any more difficult than it already is. It has already found the perfect balance of risk and reward.",,,"Sekiro comes packed with a beautiful world full of various characters, incredibly challenging bosses and a lot more to explore to your heart's content.",,,,,,,,,,,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice stands tall among some of From Software’s most renowned titles. The challenge is clear and present, the story and mystery are equally intriguing, and the beautiful vistas and soundtrack work in perfect harmony. It might be entirely different to what came before it, but Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a near-perfect experience and a natural progression of the Soulsborne series.",,,,"Sekiro is the fabulous culmination of From Software’s modus operandi, honed relentlessly since 2009. While it plays like its predecessors, it also feels different and fresh.","Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is not the most polished or accessible title on the market, but it’s certainly one of the most well-executed and satisfying gaming experiences I’ve ever had the chance to play. If you have dropped this game or are on the fence about trying it due to its difficulty, I implore you to give it a chance and really take your time with it. It’s well worth the effort.","It’s certainly not a game for those looking for a more relaxing trip through mythical Japanese inspired locales, but whoever decides to stick with Sekiro through its hardships are bound to experience one of the most rewarding and memorable titles of the year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quite simply put, Forza Horizon 3 is the pinnacle of open-world racers available on the Xbox One.","Seriously, I have no idea where Playground Games can go with Forza Horizon from here. The map is huge, yet well-populated with things to do. The car selection is vast, the controls are spot-on, the game looks gorgeous in all areas, the musical options are diverse, the online play is excellent, and the community tools are rock solid. I have little doubt that we’ll see a Forza Horizon 4 down the road, but I think you’ll find Forza Horizon 3 leaves little room for improvement. It’s an A+ game top to bottom, and absolutely one of the best games you’ll play all year.","A real masterwork and definitely the best arcade racer yet, thanks to an incredibly balanced driving model, tons of contents both off and on-line, and an outstanding technical production.

Too much of it may feel like busywork and filler, but few other racers are this slick or feature-packed, and it certainly has moments of magic.","Forza Horizon 3 is a masterclass in open-world racing and bigger and better than its excellent predecessor across the board. It looks fantastic, the car selection and customisation is second to none, and the size and variety of the sprawling Australian outback is magnificent. Above all, Horizon 3 never loses sight of the fact that tearing through postcard-perfect locations should be fun, and it puts the tools in our hands to keep it that way, always.

The visuals are simply phenomenal, the sound effects and soundtrack bring aural pleasure to your ears, and the gameplay is infectiously addictive.","Forza Horizon 3 feels familiar with its already-polished gameplay, but the new setting, cars, and incredible customization options opens the throttle on an already-fantastic platform.

I struggled to find a single thing I didn’t love about Forza Horizon 3, and that’s a fantastic problem to have.","Forza Horizon 3 is one of the best racing games I have ever played, and somehow continues to prove that this series just keeps getting better. How Playground Games continues to make what already feels like the definitive arcade racing experience even better is beyond my comprehension. If you have any interest in racing games at all, this is a can’t miss title.","Forza Horizon 3 is a visual feast and an impressive entry into the Forza line-up. The Australian environment feels and looks realistic, with lush rainforests tapering away into the red and dusty outback.

You won't regret it.",,,"With Forza Horizon 3, Turn 10 and Playground Games affirm the series’ status as the driving game for everyone The new emphasis on off-road options isn’t at the expense of traditional races, thanks to the sheer volume of activities. All the while, Playground Games’ calculated kitchen-sink design philosophy and rich reward system persistently tempt you to explore beyond your comfort zone, whether it’s gifting your first Ariel Nomad buggy or reminding you that stunt races can impress thousands of fans. Enhancing your own brand might feel like a strange motivation to hit the road, but pulling off sick e-drifts on a mile-long series of curves makes the PR work worthwhile.","Minor music service quibble aside, Forza Horizon 3 is a beautiful, immensely entertaining, joyous arcade racer that successfully builds on Playground Games' already tremendous formula.

Maybe it´s not very original, but still you will be pleased what it can offer in a compact, coherent and cohesive package. Forza Horizon 3 will hardly seek an adequate opponent among the competitors.","The driving mechanics are an (arcade) dream come true, the visuals are fantastic and Australia as exotic location delivers a wide variety of environments, challenges and contest. It has its flaws like the still overly aggressive AI but nonetheless this is definitely the best game in this franchise so far.","That, really, is the fundamental value in Forza Horizon 3. It wants you to have fun. It will challenge you, it will ask you to improve as a driver and it will reward you for doing so. But first and foremost, it wants you to spend time in this ridiculous playground, with some of the best (and strangest) cars in the world, having an absolute blast.",,"Forza Horizon 3 retains everything we’ve come to love about the open world racer while incrementally improving upon its formula.

It's still good, and fun for newcomers, but it's definitely at the point of diminishing returns. Throw in a myriad of technical issues, and it's ultimately a disappointing sequel.",A masterpiece that offers you an epic driving experience in an open world environment. It has been refined and greatly improved upon from the previous games especially when it comes to visuals.,"Forza Horizon 3 is an evolution of the earlier games in the series. The graphics are better and these might be the best controls in a driving game I've ever come across. Overall, this is a fantastic experience.",,"Forza Horizon 3 doesn’t reinvent the wheel in any way – but it does perfect it. Everything that worked about past games is better here. There’s more terrain to traverse, more variety, and the inclusion of off-road racing alone expands the game’s already-expansive replay value. If you have always wanted to enjoy a Forza game, but don’t like the idea of sim racers, the Horizon series makes for a great gateway.","A beautifully crafted Australian locale combined with an amazing car collection take this entry to the next level. Forza Horizon 3 builds on the driving prowess and open world diversity of its predecessors, taking it to the top of the podium.","The worst thing about Forza Horizon 3 is that it may have stolen me away from the 'Forza Motorsport' series for good. There's an important freedom to be found in the Australian festival racing, and the land is a gorgeous one when alight or after the rain. For those of us on the HDR train, this is close to must-have demo material, but it's tremendous fun on top of that. Playing casually or with a crazed glint in my eye, Forza Horizon ' is a fantastic playground.",,"Not only is it absolutely stunning, it's done a fantastic job of putting you at the centre of the racing in every way possible.","A feast of driving that sets out to sate whatever vehicular desire you may have from minute-to-minute.

Playground Games' take on Australia falls right in line. It's not quite the leap that the franchise made from the original Horizon to Horizon 2, but it's not on cruise control, either. There's enough variation here -- from the feel of cars to the game modes to the radio stations -- that this is another excellent installment in an always-excellent series. And, since variation is a key reason for Horizon 3's success, well, Australia seems like it's probably the most perfectly appropriate setting.","Forza Horizon 3 pulls out all the stops to provide one of most fluid and enjoyable racing experiences out there. A must have for casual car fans and hardcore gearheads alike, Forza Horizon 3 may even surpass the mainline series in terms of fun with this effort.","Fuelled by a semi-simulator brain and arcade heart, Horizon 3 is a very g'day indeed. [Dec 2016, p.62]","Tuned ever-so-slightly in ""race trim"" for more consistency doesn't hinder the uproarious, maniacal wild side of free roam. In a vacuum, it plays just as well as the first two.","It's a wilder side of Forza where you're free to tackle Australia in whatever way you feel is the most enjoyable, and it gives you all the tools you need to make the experience yours. I've always enjoyed the Motorsport side of the track, but Horizon 3 is where you go to have flat-out fun while still sharing the series' strong racing pedigree.","This series has always felt like a breath of fresh air in a genre that grows ever more obsessed with the fidelity of its simulations.

Every location feels like a game in itself and that makes the game much more sensational and swift.",,"The third game in the Forza Horizon series has far exceeded its status as a loud and brash spin-off, becoming a racing title that embodies the best of this generation. Beautiful visuals, pitch perfect gameplay and eternally rewarding, there are few racing games that have ever come close to what Playground Games have achieved with Forza Horizon 3.","A truly great racing experience. The fact that the developers were able to combine their premier arcade racing with a new layer of depth and control is something definitely of note. It’s proof that an accessible game doesn’t have to be overly simple and can provide options to the full spectrum of fans, from those wanting to just drive around all the way to those who really want to fine-tune their own monstrous machines for the road.","Really the only place Forza Horizon 3 skids out is in its lack of ingenuity. It’s packed, over delivering on what was already plenty of content in the previous game, but it comes up a little short in terms of innovation. Racing through a gorgeous field, foliage crumpling under your tires, the sun gleaming off your dented roof – it’s a sight, but one that I recall seeing countless times in Forza Horizon 2. Much of what you do in Forza Horizon 3, you have likely done before. Still, it’s never looked this good, been this big or done its job with as much confidence.","Forza Horizon 3 is one of the best iterations of the series, with awesome visuals and lots of content. It would have been perfect with a worthy cockpit view and few more new things.",,"Playground gives us, again, a huge and spectacular game with new features, like the 4 player cooperative campaign and the challenges creation. The control is almost perfect and it has enough events and races to keep us playing it for months. There aren't many new gameplay mechanics but Forza Horizon 3 is, no doubt, the best open world racing game out there.",Forza Horizon 2 has been my go-to racer for the last couple years. And now its position in my game library been handily usurped by its stellar successor.,"Massive, full and with a list of things to do which borders upon incessant, Forza Horizon 3 is a driving game both without direction and made by a studio seemingly – understandably – bored with cars. It isn't wholly different or worse than its predecessors, but after four years of these games, and with titles like DiRT Rally rediscovering the fundamental, basic thrills of racing simulations, Horizon 3 feels tired.",Forza Horizon 3 sets a new target for driving games. Australia is a beautiful region to run and is full of all kinds of activities. Discovering it on one of the 350 available autos is the best way to discover the pleasure of driving.,"Forza Horizon 3 offers glorious graphics, big variation and clever online implementation. It might not be the perfect racing game, but if you are a fan of the previous games in the series, it’s a no-brainer.","Forza Horizon 3 is as much fun as it is beautiful. Australia steals the show with its diverse landscapes, while there are loads of events to take part in. With minor improvements here and there, Forza Horizon 3 is a worthy successor to the older games.","In the absence of other open-world racing series like Burnout Paradise and Test Drive Unlimited, the Forza Horizon series has steadily become a racing staple, and with Forza Horizon 3, it's now on cruise control. With a revised skill system, a wealth of racing content, and a co-operative campaign, you'll want to bend and curve around every corner in picturesque Australia landscape at least once, even if that's the only time.",,"I love the mix of exploring, racing and ancillary tasks, coupled with the great driving physics and the audiovisual fireworks (heaven!)","Forza Horizon 3 is an invigorating open-world racer, although it may be a little too familiar to anyone who’s been down this road before.","In many ways, Forza Horizon 3 is the perfect sequel – it adds enough content to stay fresh, while retaining all the hallmarks that made the previous games so awesome.",,"Simply, the best arcade racing on the market. For content, gameplay and graphics.",It's the many smaller improvements and new features that make Forza Horizon 3 the best and most beautiful game in the series.,"Forza Horizon 3 is close to racing perfection, with stunning visuals, great Drivatar AI and enough content to keep you busy for months.","An epic and gorgeous drive through Oz scenery, and the best driving game this year.","Playground Games reminds us once again that a car can be nothing more than a huge, expensive toy. Breaking the law in the Australian outback and building a great festival is a lot of fun - the newest Forza Horizon is the best one yet.",,"Even more than other Forza Horizon games, with this one you'll experience the awesome feeling of driving beautiful cars in a huge open world. There is more space for off-road racing, which is a nice feature on top of the strong concept of Forza Horizon.","The more hardcore sim fans might find things a little too arcade-ish for their liking. Although there are circuit races on street tracks, they'll never compare to lapping Spa or the Nordschleife, and the off-road driving isn't the same test of skill that you'll get from DiRT Rally. But for fans of previous Horizon games or the Project Gotham series, this sequel will probably tick all your boxes.",,,,"Nicer and more sophisticated, also we finally see the sequel trying to change the existing status quo. The third Horizon is doing the most to deserve your attention, and newly it is now available on PC too. [Issue #268]",,This game gets my heart rate going like no other racer. It captures the childish glee of playing with toy cars and combines it with the adrenaline of throwing yourself around in a very expensive hunk of metal.,"Forza Horizon 3 manages to capture much of the familiarity of the previous two games while adding a whole lot more to do, making it as close to a perfect racing experience than ever before.","Forza Horizon seems to get bigger and better with each new entry to the series, and Forza Horizon 3 is by far the biggest festival yet. It's hard to imagine where developer Playground Games will go if they are given the green light for Forza Horizon 4.

I love having all of these ways of competing against my friends, and I think the Blueprint events are a smart way to make the game feel more personal and connected. I plan on making at least a few more missions and sending them to all of my friends after Horizon goes live later this month.",,,,"Forza developers have formulated a recipe for driving game that’s sure to receive high scores, and now they’re exploiting it for all it’s worth.

This game continues with its previous style, but if it's not broke, don't fix it.","It could be argued that this is more of an incremental improvement over the second Forza Horizon game because the overall formula is not drastically different from what has come before. However, almost every single aspect from the changing weather and gameplay tweaks provide an improved experience that makes the exploration of virtual Australia an absolute joy.","Forza Horizon 3 is big, bold and beautiful. There's always something new to see, do or drive, and the game's mix of colorful, vivid graphics and an amazing soundtrack leaves the player with a constant, happy feeling. However, when compared to Horizon 2 there isn't all that much new stuff here, and the game's progression system is less than stellar, actively making huge parts of Australia feel empty and meaningless for hours upon hours.","Horizon 3 wants to teach you how special cars are, not by proving to you how fast they can go or how well they corner, but by showing you the kinds of experiences they can bring you. In the real world, these adventures are locked away by money, time, and, your sense of self-preservation. In this playground, you’re free from all that.

Simply put, Dead Cells is epic.","Dead Cells is an excellent game that will challenge and delight seasoned roguelike addicts, yet Motion Twin has also made it accessible to newcomers. The combination of roguelite and metroidvania genres wraps the bitter pill of permadeath in a sweet coating of exploration, with a solid progression system and plenty of reward loops to help inexperienced players get into the game. Meanwhile expert players can speed run, ramp up the difficulty level and equip the gear and mutations designed for skilled users. Dying repeatedly has never felt this good.",,"Dead Cells is a frantic and captivating side-scrolling action game, mixing elements from multiple genres and showcasing a great pixel-art design with fantastic animations and effects.

It’s not going to take it easy on you, and it can get brutal at times, especially when making no progress in runs.

Psychonauts 2‘s story is deeper, more heartfelt, and wonderfully compelling. The mechanics and concepts in the original have greatly improved (although not without its minor issues), and the characters and their personalities exude bucketloads of charm. Without a doubt, this game will be on a number of game of the year nominations. Better sixteen years late than never.","Psychonauts 2 is absolutely everything it should be. It does not do everything perfectly, but it builds on what fans loved about the first Psychonauts in a way that keeps the spirit of the series alive and well.","Like wafts of familiar scents, moments throughout Psychonauts evoke memories of both Double Fine and LucasArts’ highest highs. Many of Double Fine’s best known collaborators, from visual artists to voice talent, have pooled in. It makes a fine game, one about the atrophy of counter culture, how bonds make finer milestones than accomplishments, and how past failures do not negate future glories. Psychonauts 2 is a rare treasure, one that feels rarer and rarer as years go by, but clearly still possible with the proper gang of weirdos.","Sixteen years after the first game and no less than six years after the announcement that there would be a sequel, Psychonauts 2 is finally on the market. But is it worth the long wait? We're not going to beat about the bush. The answer is yes.","The bumps in my playthrough (for a final time, so far) have been minimal, and breaking to write these words to meet an embargo is keeping me from more quality Raz time. Psychonauts 2 is an intoxicating rollercoaster ride of invention and passion allowed the space and time to blossom that so few big-studio productions receive without substantial boardroom meddling, so credit where it's due to Xbox Game Studios for letting Double Fine loose with the creative juice. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've some more brains to bump around inside of, and some more retina-spinning sights to drink in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It adds new monsters, a new location, and new armour and weapons to customise, but Iceborne also delivers new details that are fleshed into the core title. The Clutch Claw mechanic transforms the way combat works for the base game, as well as the expansion, and the monster fights are as epic as ever.

The game remains in-depth yet surprisingly accessible throughout the entirety of play, welcoming and uniting newcomers and returning fans alike. It’s a truly breathtaking adventure. Simply put, and I don’t say this lightly, Monster Hunter: World is a masterpiece.","Monster Hunter: World captures that feel of hunting, and despite its technical quirks and poor design decisions, if you've got a group of friends to play with it comes highly recommended.

The new ones will enjoy a great game about hunting enormous beasts with an interesting coop mode and a well-balanced progress and combat system.,"Monster Hunter World renews the hunts of the saga keeping the keys that made it great and unique, but with enough new features and adaptations so that all players can get closer to it. This is the most dynamic, intuitive, modern, funniest, and almost unlimited release thanks to its online features.","It's great to see that the franchise makes a triumphant debut on Microsoft's machine because many gamers expressed concerns about optimization and other issues before launch. If you like challenging experiences along the lines of Dark Souls, be sure to give Monster Hunter: World a go. The game will keep you engaged for dozens of hours because it takes patience more than anything to become a legendary hunter.","There's so much depth and scope to Monster Hunter World that some aspects I've only lightly touched on, or haven't even mentioned; the Canteen and its bizarre cat-chef, the Special Arena, Investigations and Bounties, the Hub's numerous activities. NPCs and provisioners, the marvelous Palico gadgets and so on. After 60+ hours and having just recently finished the bulk of the main story and hitting High Rank, there's still so much more I've yet to see. For the sake of getting this review out before Christmas 2142 all you need to know is that Monster Hunter World is an amazing, complex, and beautifully realised evolution of the franchise.

ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps,,"One of the main differences between Indie and AAA titles is that when it come to indie games, developers have more freedom to try new and ambitious ideas, as Ori and the Will of the Wisps did, and the result is not only a game that feels as good and fresh as its predecessor, but also improved in almost every aspect.",,,"Ori and the Will of the Wisps is everything you could want from a sequel to Ori and the Blind Forest. It isn’t a revolutionary new step forward for the series by any means, but it does an excellent job of building upon all the core concepts that made Ori and the Blind Forest so fantastic, whilst also adding enough new features to justify its title as a sequel, rather than an additional DLC expansion. If you haven’t played through Ori and the Blind Forest (you should), Ori and the Will of the Wisps is worth jumping into regardless, as it polishes the Ori formula to a shine and is an incredible experience in its own right.","Ori and the Will of the Wisps had some lofty expectations coming into it, and it’s safe to say that it more than met them handsomely, Some difficulty spikes can frustrate, but overall it’s a charming, beautiful, brilliantly fun title. Gamepass subscriber or not, you absolutely need to experience this game.","The wait for Ori and the Will of the Wisps will most definitely prove worthwhile: Moon Studios has created a masterpiece. The sequel manages to be more beautiful, heartfelt, and challenging than Ori and the Blind Forest. Some of the new changes feel a little superfluous to Ori's world, but only in comparison to everything which the game already offers. Will of the Wisps offers a real challenge and comes with its own share of frustration, but in doubling down on everything players loved in Blind Forest and going beyond it, Moon Studios has achieved a superb sequel.","It’s a stellar sequel to a game that I already loved, and well worth checking out whether you pick up a stand-alone copy or download it via Game Pass. If you have any affinity for platformers or action-adventure style games in the same vein, then you really owe it to yourself to check out Ori and the Will of the Wisps.","Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an amazing game, managing to further elevate its genre thanks to a masterful work in gameplay, level design, art design, music and storytelling. A compelling and touching adventure that everyone should experience.","Ori and the Will of the Wisps is not only a great platform game, now it is also an amazing action game. The beauty of its visuals and its soundtrack hide a very hard and challenging game where a mistake can cost you very expensive, but that rewards with moments of a beauty and madness difficult to overcome. Not only does it become one of the hits of the genre and one of the most important releases of the year, it also becomes one of the essential games in the entire Xbox One catalog.","Ori and The Will of Wisps is the best game I've been able to enjoy so far this year, thanks both to its incredible artistic level and its impressive soundtrack, as well as its frantic gameplay, which will keep you in front of the screen for hours and hours. This title from Moon Studios is a true masterpiece in terms of visuals, sound and gameplay. A new standard for the Metroidvania and an exclusive that will be hard to beat in this final stretch before the arrival of Xbox Series X.","Make no mistake, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a true work of art, a hallmark of excellence for the medium, and an example to be followed. That said, a bit more polish would have gone a long way to put the icing on this very glorious cake.","Perhaps the biggest problem with a game that is simply this gorgeous to look at, is that even the slightest of frame-rate hitches feels like a betrayal. A betrayal to the expectation of perfection you get as soon as the adventure begins. Ori and the Will of the Wisps isn’t perfect, but its issues are mere momentary lapses in an otherwise stellar action-adventure. An experience that feels monumental in both scope and presentation.","Ori and the Will of the Wisps on Xbox One is an amazing work of art that happens to double as a truly fantastic game. Moon Studios have outdone themselves here with an emotional, engaging, difficult but above all enjoyable game that should delight gamers everywhere.",,,,"Moon Studios doesn't necessarily break new ground with Ori and the Will of the Wisps and that's OK. The additions that have been made improve on the experience, even though it's hard to be as impressed as we were the first time around.",Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an extraordinary Metroidvania game with impeccable artistic direction and incredibly galvanizing gameplay. It can possibly be one of the best exclusives in the entire Xbox One catalog.,"Ori and the Will of the Wisps is game that’s hard to not love. It made me want to scream and shout a few times – a certain chase scene that was truly demanding and a final area that relies heavily on trial and error included – but for every moment that frustrated me, there were ten that amazed me. The platforming is crisp, combat is engaging, and the world just begs to be explored. Mix in drop-dead gorgeous visuals, a score to die for and a story that will break your heart, and Ori and the Will of the Wisps will make you glad to be alive.","Ori and the Will of the Wisps improves upon its predecessor in almost every way, from its drastically improved combat system to its use of NPCs and side quests. Like Ori and the Blind Forest before it, Will of the Wisps is held back by intermittent technical hitches that can result in some frustrating moments, but it hardly keeps this incredible sequel from shining through.","Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a game I might not have felt we needed, but could not stop playing once I dove in. It retains what made the original special while also adding enough to warrant a sequel. Moon Studios truly has carved out a spot for themselves among the pantheon of indie developers. I cannot wait to see what they do next and as for this title, there is simply no reason not to dive in. It is included in Game Pass and even at its asking price, it is more than worth the price of admission.","Ori and the Will of the Wisps comes with some outstanding quality of life improvements over the gameplay of the original. The inconsistent performance won't completely break your engagement, but it will affect it. That said, there's just no denying that the world of Ori is one that's easy to get lost in and fall in love with.",,"Ori and the Will of Wisps is a truly delightful and devastating game that blends new ideas into a solid foundation, all topped off with an incredible score and even more breathtaking levels to explore.","Backed by an amazing art style, a great soundtrack and a selection of heartwarming characters to take you through the story, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is pure platforming perfection.","In five years, the Metroidvania has changed, and Ori has also learned from its peers to stay in the race. A little less demanding but much more varied, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is indeed the great adventure we have been waiting for.",,Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a remarkable synthesis of artful design and beautiful moments.,"In the beauty stakes and beyond, there are very few, in the rarefied realms of indie or AAA, who can challenge it.",,,,"Ori and the Will of the Wisps offers a gorgeous world to explore and a varied, creative series of abilities and tasks that guide my exploration and help me see more of this wonderful place. It expands my options in combat and offers me more to do, and mostly benefits from that added complexity, while losing some of its focus in the process. Overall, however, it’s a worthy trade off.",,"Ori and the Will of the Wisps is another excellent entry in the series that manages to build successfully on everything that made the original such a standout experience. With satisfying platforming, a handful of amazing boss encounters, expanded combat options and a story every bit as tear-inducing as its predecessor's, this is another outstanding effort from Moon Studios – as well as being one of the most beautiful games we've ever laid eyes on and easily one of the best platformers currently available on Xbox One.",,,,,,"Peppered with devious puzzles, Ori and the Will of the Wisp is an irresistible challenge. There is extraordinary attention to detail – the entire world feels alive with excitement and danger. I struggled to put down the controller as I progressed deeper into the game, unable and unwilling to let anything stand in the way of Ori realising his true destiny. A bold and ambitious sequel.",,,"I actually haven’t played the first Ori so I can’t compare the two nor do I have a bias based on how much I enjoyed the previous installment. I would wait for some patches before attempting this game. It’s excellent, there’s no doubt about it, but when things don’t work you become robbed of the experience. Still, it’s better than most platformers out there, even with the issues.","The story is fantastic, the world is breathtaking, and all of that pales in comparison to the wonderfully made gameplay that soars both as a platforming and combat game. Moon Studios has outdone itself with Will of the Wisps, delivering an experience that doesn’t have any lulls, makes the player feel clever, and just keeps getting better as it goes.","It may not be able to claim much originality compared to its predecessor, or Metroidvania games in general, but this is still one of the best examples of its craft this generation.",,"After the stunning Ori and the Blind Forest, I found it hard to imagine Moon Studios being able to one-up themselves with Will of the Wisps and yet it's another beautifully crafted chapter in a series that is held so dear and treasured. As a platforming exercise, it's slick and sublime, it has evolved in subtle ways and Ori's world has grown a little larger as a result. While Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a sequel that'll challenge your resolve and temper your spirit at times, its final act will fill your heart and have it bursting with joie de vivre.",,,,,,"This is an exceptional platformer, absolutely incredible on an audiovisual level, and it reminds you that, when they developers get it right, there’s something great and unique about jumping.","Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a traditional video game sequel. Expect more abilities, a larger map, and more colors than in the first. I hoped to see a touch of subversion to its formula instead of strait-laced augmentation, but it’s easy to make peace with such complaints.",,,,,,"Ori and the Will of the Wisps succeeds where the original game faltered while maintaining everything that made it work. The spirit of the first game lives on with a touching tale of life, love, and loss that just so happens to have some of the tighest combat in a side-scrolling game on the market today. It’s a more exciting game than the original and an improvement on something that was already so well-crafted is quite an accomplishment. Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a must-play game for anyone who loves side-scrolling action-platformers and sends you on an emotional journey from beginning to end.","Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an unmitigated triumph. Every element is executed to perfection; the pinpoint platforming, kinetic combat, and heartfelt storytelling are second to none. Visually stunning and accompanied by an evocative soundscape you will feel like you’re stepping into another world, and it’s one you’ll likely never want to leave.",,,,Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a terrific and affecting bout of escapism. Its ‘Metroidvania’ roots reach deep - those that remain unmoved by this style of 2D action aren’t likely to find anything revelatory. But its aura and execution is a thing of beauty.,,,"Ori and the Will of the Wisps is one of the most beautiful games you will play this year. Every stage is a visual and artistic masterpiece, and Gareth Coker's brillant soundtrack is the most delicious cherry on the cake. Unfortunately, the game still suffers from technical flaws, which have yet to be definitely fixed.","Ori and the Will of the Wisps serves up a balanced meal of combat and platforming that captured me immediately. I'm not a big fan of the first game, but Ori's weapon wheel and slick maneuverability turns Will of the Wisps into an irresistible ballet. Unfortunately, performance problems on the Xbox One S in particular bring down a game that is otherwise almost perfect.",,,,"To no one's surprise, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is visually and audibly beautiful. Once you get the hang of Ori's abilities, the platforming is fluid and satisfying, the combat is cool, and the game rewards your exploration even when said exploration is a result of getting lost. Through it all lingers a feeling of accomplishment that makes it so easy to keep playing, even through the frustrating parts.","More epic, wonderful and complex than the first chapter, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is one of the best adventures of the year. Essential.",,"The result is a Metroidvania-style platformer to be experienced, able to take your breath away both with its spectacular audiovisual performance and with its commendable all-round gameplay - for the occasion strengthened by a convincing action grain. Too bad for some burrs in the performance and in the general cleanliness of the code that compromise a vote that otherwise would have deserved to be even more bombastic.",,,"Ori and the Will of the Wisps does everything that a good sequel is supposed to do. It refines The Blind Forest’s mechanics, expands on the world, and throws in a whole bunch of new moves and concepts. But in an era that’s rich with “emotional platformers,” Will of the Wisps doesn’t do anything to make itself stand out. It’s a fine, if not forgettable, experience.",,,"Ori and the Will of the Wisps is bigger and more polished than the original title. I can't recommend playing it before the original, if only because the plot relies on you having played the first game. Otherwise, this is an absolute must-play for fans of the genre. Some minor quibbles and a few annoying bugs hold it back, but hopefully, those will be addressed by the day-one patch. If you've been waiting for Will of the Wisps, you'll be extremely pleased.",,Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a bold and ambitious sequel and I really did not want to put it down when I was done. You owe to yourself to give it a try.,,,,"Ori and the Will of the Wisps builds on its predecessor’s near-perfect Metroidvania platforming and grows the concept to wonderful effect. A game that’s as much about rebirth, hope and wonder as it is death and decay, Will of the Wisps is a beautiful, enchanting piece of fantasy, and an instant classic.","As long as the performance issues are completely ironed out in the near future, this is one platformer that’ll long be remembered.",,"Ori and the Blind Forest was already a masterpiece, but Ori and the Will of the Wisps manages to be even better thanks to new gameplay ideas and new characters. Simply a must-play.",The combination of the original game's narrative charm and solid platforming mechanics with a much longer story and more intricate skill trees and bonuses come together to make a must-play game.,"Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a metroidvania like no other.

Despite its small quirks, Ori 2 is one of the best Metroidvanias ever.",,"Ori and the Will of the Wisps is indeed a challenging game, but one not so hard as to be rage-inducing.

Whether you are coming to this as a seasoned gamer who wants a challenge or someone who just loves the game's beauty, it is simply a joy to play and will captivate you for hours.",,,,Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a fantastic sequel. It builds on the original with a few new ideas to deliver a complete experience.,,,,"Ori and the Will of the Wisps feels familiar, even though there are many new elements introduced. Not all of them are truly adding to the experience, but they are in no way detrimental. Even though the game is buggy, this metroidvania meets platformer is still a blast.","A beautiful, difficult, and masterful swan song for 2D platforming on the Xbox One. Buy it if you have any interest in the genre.",,"The challenge is something that Ori and the Will of the Wisps nails perfectly. Whether it's a boss battle, a chase sequence, a puzzle, or a section that's hard to navigate through, Will of the Wisps doesn't shy away from the difficulty.",,,,"Ori and the Will of the Wisps comes close to being the perfect sequel. While the new combat focus admittedly doesn’t fit well with the story, it’s still a ton of fun, and coupled with the new autosave feature, ensures a more fast-paced and fluid style of play.","No game is perfect and I don’t believe giving a game a 10/10 means that it is perfect. However, I believe that Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a masterpiece that deserves the highest praise that I can give it. Moon Studios is a shining example that a small team working with a lot of heart and passion can create something beautiful, fun and challenging. It expands on the original in every way and you will not find a better game in the Metroidvania genre. I personally can’t wait to dive back into the game on a harder difficulty.",,,,"The visuals are mesmerizing and the music is enchanting, the combat and platforming sequences are smooth as ever and despite its technical issues, The Will of the Wisps is the sequel that The Blind Forest deserves.","Will of the Wisps is easily one of the best Metroidvanias ever, and I know that includes company like Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night.",,,Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a wonderful Metroidvania that manages to be both beautiful and challenging.

The developers have used proven solutions borrowed from other games, but were clever and creative about it. The game is coherent and will surprise you more than once. Is it as powerful and the first part? No. Is it as fun as the Blind Forest? Definitely yes.",,"Moon Studios is back with a sequel that has managed to expand the well-established bases of its predecessor with great success and keeping the essence of the franchise intact.

Every grapple, slam, and triple jump builds on that unmatched flow of gently nudging you towards confidence, rewarding you when it’s there, and punishing the cocky. You’ll soon be flying through these gorgeous worlds with grace and style, and while it may look effortless on-screen, you’ll be concentrating damn hard on perfecting every move. That’s one of the best feelings in fluid platforming, and you can guarantee that Will of the Wisps oozes such sophistication.",,"Minor niggles aside, I can wholeheartedly recommend Ori And The Will Of The Wisps to all of you. Whether or not you've played the original game, picking up this new adventure should be a no-brainer. Moon Studios has gone bigger and better in every conceivable way, crafting an epic, emotional adventure that borrows from some of the best games out there and smartly remixes various genres and ideas in thrilling, unexpected ways.",Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an essential Xbox game. Building on every aspect of Blind Forest – from art to music right the way through to level design and combat – this is a sequel worthy of celebration.,"Ori & The Will of the Wisps is a wonder to behold, a joy to play, and a must-have for anyone with the means to play it.","Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a poignant story and its gameplay is richer than that of its predecessor; it offers plenty of new features with an interesting RPG dimension. The world of Moon Studios is always as magical for the eye and the mind, and enchanting music brings the perfect final touch to this dazzling adventure. Nevertheless, the game suffers from real technical problems: frequent framerate drops and freezes prevent you from fully enjoying this journey. Aside from that, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is almost perfect.","Ori and the Will of the Wisps is the worthy sequel the fans have been waiting for. Without revolutionising the formula of the first opus, it improves and adds to it in many ways. It's bigger, more complete, more challenging, while preserving the visual identity and narrative style of Ori and the Blind Forest. Although the difficulty is quite high, it's well balanced by the other game mechanisms. It's a good sequel for the fans of the first one, and the opportunity to discover the license for the others.","Ori and the Will of the Wisps may not feel as vital as the original did when it debuted, but fans of the genre would be foolish to overlook the sequel. Its visual style, themes, and engrossing score distinguish it from others in its space. Its fluid sense of movement and fast-paced combat make it a blast to play, with plenty of hidden challenges to uncover. Ori and the Will of the Wisps will please fans of the original and anyone looking for an engrossing adventure steeped in natural mystery and wonder.","The game improves upon its predecessor, and finds new ways to demonstrate their shared eco-friendly themes.","If the issues get fixed in a timely matter, I say Ori and the Will of the Wisp is a must-buy for platforming fanatics. The mechanics are smooth and intuitive without being repetitive. The well-made map layout, good soundtrack, and modern animated movie quality rivals what can be seen in high-budget titles. As the standard of mainstream gaming improves, Ori and the Will of the Wisps can be the game that raises the bar in quality, as long it’s playable.","Artful animation and visuals combine with tightly designed exploration, though beware persistent technical issues.","With Will of the Wisps, the Ori series’ focus has widened. While some of the details have blurred in the process, the result is a game that’s much more expansive while even more magical and heart-wrenching than the original. That’s coming from someone who just spent 15 hours with a bug-riddled early review copy. I’m guessing it’s even better fixed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now.",,"The Xbox One version looks just as good if not a little better than its PS4 counterpart. It runs at a higher resolution and the world feels alive. It still has markings of its PS3 building, but it looks great regardless. I cannot wait to play Kiwami and Kiwami 2 on Xbox as well, as I never got a chance to finish those when they originally released.

It may not have many enhancements for gamers who play on X, but it was already a looker, with a high frame rate to begin with. This is one of the glitziest and brightest games out there, and not relying on the most advanced technology meant the team could push an older engine to new heights. Dropping 40 hours means not even seeing half of what Yakuza 0 has to offer. It is a huge package of value that seemingly never stops giving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Today, three years after Western release on Xbox One, Yakuza 0 still translates well as an engaging and fun experience, particularly for those who love a good story.

This mechanic has been changed over the years so to see it still thriving here immediately dates the game, but none of this is enough to make for a bad experience.

A title that will undoubtedly delight fans of Shepard's epic. Those who grew up and discovered a genre thanks to the work of BioWare will find their favorite titles like never before. The facelift looks great on each of the three games. In addition, the increased and stable fps on Xbox Series X gives a totally new look and feel to the title.",,,"If you haven’t played Mass Effect before, the Legendary Edition provides the perfect opportunity.

We can only hope the next chapter continues the legacy these games have created, but for now this collection is a must own.",,,,"If you've never played a Mass Effect game before, you can consider purchasing the Legendary Edition an absolute no-brainer. If you fancy revisiting BioWare's seminal sci-fi saga (and frankly, why wouldn't you?), then, equally, Mass Effect Legendary Edition is essential. Bottom line: you need this.","If you ignore these flaws and show indulgence for a 14-year-old game, you will reconnect with a memorable and still captivating saga to walk through, coated in a generous layer of varnish that allows it to - almost - hang on to the present day.",,"Mass Effect: Legendary Edition isn't this huge transformation for the original trilogy. The remastered Mass Effect 1 is a more enjoyable experience than playing the original game today, and makes for a far more palatable entry point to the series. And Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 look far better than they did before, with minor but welcome changes to specific pieces of content. But otherwise this remaster delivers the same experience the original trilogy did. In some respects, that's not a wholly good thing--time has reinforced and made clearer certain underlying issues of the trilogy. But there's a reason the Mass Effect trilogy is beloved by so many: Its strength resides in the wonderful journey that it sends you on, one that's preserved in this remaster.",,,,,,,,,,,,This is an appropriately enhanced re-release of an epic SciFi-adventure.

That hasn’t aged a jot.,,,,,,,"The fact that the first Mass Effect is fundamentally the same game, is a lost chance to correct the mishaps of the original one.

Despite its shortcomings, the Mass Effect trilogy has tremendous qualities and enough of them to have made an impression on a whole generation of gamers. Mass Effect Legendary Edition is not only a nostalgic pleasure for the original players, but also for all of those who never had the chance to discover its epicness. More than just an outstanding trilogy, the latter carries within itself the whole background of the Bioware studio as well as the stigmas of an ambitious project that was overwhelmed by the players’ expectations. Playing Mass Effect Legendary Edition enables us to partake in one amazing science fiction story as well as having a glimpse of the background behind the entertainment industry that we adore so much: the one of gaming.","It's as great as most people say it is. There's not a conversation I want to skip, not a companion I want to ignore, and really not a single mission I want to decline. Mass Effect is the ultimate RPG. When so many of your actions affect the future of not just you and your friends, but potentially the entire universe, there's a great deal of responsibility on BioWare to deliver outcomes that feel worth one's time. Even acknowledging its final scene is notoriously polarizing, and you may come down harder on it than I do. Either way, the journey is well worth your time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"BioWare has done quite a bit here to make this beloved series more accessible than it has been in quite some time, especially when it comes to the visuals.

It carries the torch from past into future, dutifully imbuing Shepard’s fantastical voyages with a sense of modernity that will help the series continue to attract new fans as we inch boldly closer to whatever comes next. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel because that’s not what it sets out to do, but it does improve the first game to a considerable degree. It takes care to transfer the largely-unchanged sequels into a new decade of gaming.","Mass Effect Legendary Edition is the best way to experience one of the most memorable trilogies in video game history. The remake doesn't just capitalizes on the nostalgia of an entire generation of gamers – it keeps the original experience intact while modernizing it, opening the door to a whole new legion of fans who have here the greatest example of Bioware's magic.","As an epic sci-fi story or as an elaborate futuristic dating simulator or even as a third-person shooter, Mass Effect Legendary Edition has a little something for everyone, and puts many modern narrative-driven RPGs to shame. It may not quite be the full-blown remake that many hoped for, but it’s still the ultimate way to experience Shepard’s story, regardless of your history with the franchise, and easily takes top spot in the running for my game of the year so far. Even the Mako sections are less annoying…",Taking three of the best sci-fi RPGs of the last twenty years and putting them into one package with a variety of quality of life and visual upgrades nets out as you’d expect: the Mass Effect Legendary Edition is essential for Reaper War veterans and newcomers alike.,"Even with those smaller issues, I have absolutely no trouble recommending Mass Effect: Legendary Edition to anyone looking for a good RPG, a good story, or just a good shooter. The effort put into the original Mass Effect is commendable, especially considering its age, and Mass Effect 2 and 3 are as great as before but with better visuals and the ease of access of all being on the same disk. Like the title says, this is a legendary trilogy, and it’s one that everyone should play.","A franchise that made history almost a decade ago, and a collection that everyone that enjoy great games must play. BioWare has made an excellent remaster that manages to retain the original esence of each game, while improving them. Maybe the first game shows its age, but the series deserves that you pay that toll.","Mass Effect Legendary Edition might not be a remaster like the brilliant PS4 version of Shadow of the Colossus. But the first part of the trilogy, in particular, benefits from the visual update, higher resolution, better textures, new effects and also from its improvements in gameplay and interface. Including the fact that the Mass Effect trilogy itself remains one of the richest RPG scenarios of all time, it's easy to recommend the Legendary Edition to fans and genre connoisseurs in general as well.","Mass Effect: Legendary Edition is just what you expect from a remastering of the first three games in the series. It's not a remake itself and it's not perfect either, but it's certainly the best way to save the galaxy again without much of the hassle that the original games suffered from.","While not perfect, especially when it comes to combat in Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect Legendary Edition is still a gem. Most of the changes were put into Mass Effect 1, and the effort made it far more replayable than the original. Mass Effect 3 holds up the best of the three, proving that regardless of the controversial ending, it is still one of the best gaming experiences BioWare has made to date. Mass Effect 2 could’ve done with some more tweaking to bring it up to 3’s combat. Legendary Edition gives hope for the future of the franchise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If Yakuza: Like A Dragon proves anything, it’s that fortune does indeed favour the bold.",,,,,"Yakuza: Like a Dragon makes for an excellent new entry in this long-running series. The developers took a chance on a new protagonist and battle system, which forces fans out of their comfort zone for a very different yet, familiar Yakuza experience. Although the opening exposition can be a bit overwhelming, this is a standout video game on its own with plenty of emotional story beats, insane sub-stories, and plenty of ways to spend your time around Ijincho.",,,,"Yakuza: Like a Dragon takes the risky option of including RPG elements in its core, but it does this absolutely brilliantly. It's a new approach that may make those fans of action in previous games a little apprehensive, but it does deserve a chance. It's a fantastic gateway to the series and not to be missed by fans of Japanese RPGs. It maintains the series' spirit, refreshing it with Ichiban Kaguya, heroes who risk becoming the new icon of Yakuza.",,,,"Yakuza: Like a Dragon is the perfect game to start with this franchise if you haven't started already. Transforming a pure action game into a classic JRPG is not an easy task, but the team responsible for this seventh installment has achieved it smoothly marking the beginning of a new era of Yakuza games.",,,,"Much like Kasuga's dragonfish tattoo feels like a quirky but faithful successor to Kiryu's dragon, Yakuza: Like a Dragon rebuilds the franchise by leaving a lot of it in place. The new protagonist doesn't feel like he has seven games of story in him, but his eagerness to join the fray could carry the next few entries. And hey, if you want another game with the classic combat style, there's always a chance of a Judgment sequel.","Yakuza: Like a Dragon is surprisingly one of the best JRPGs that I’ve played since I beat Dragon Quest XI over three years ago. It’s especially impressive coming from Ryu ga Gotoku studios which has never made a turn-based RPG before. However, there are some glaring issues that take away from the overall experience; most notably the lack of a weakness indicator and wonky AoE moves during battles. If only the battle system was perfected, then Like a Dragon would be a top-tier JRPG. Regardless, I would recommend to any RPG fans that Yakuza: Like a Dragon is a must-play title.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s nice to see them expanding the game to represent how drivers work their way up into the F1 roster from the F2 feeder series.

A must buy for everyone, not just fighting games lovers.","Injustice 2 is a good game, much better than its predecessor. A fluid and colorful combat, detailed scenarios and a super personalization system. It is a great fighting game, but we have missed other challenges as well as collectibles. In that sense, it's a step back from Mortal Kombat X.","Injustice 2 teaches us how to create a fighting game with an epic story mode, good balance and with many possibilities. This second game returns with more fighters, more moves and huge customization. One of the best fighting games of this generation.","NetherRealm and Warner Bros Studios have delivered a fantastic sequel with Injustice 2. This is a fighting game overflowing with polish and charm. The particular fighting mechanics might not appeal to everybody, but adjust to them and it's almost impossible not to have a good time. If you love fighting games or DC characters, Injustice 2 is a must-buy.",,"Injustice 2 is accessible to all, introduces a diverse roster of characters and provides plenty to do. Don’t delay, join the Injustice League today.",,,"In our testing on live servers the online multiplayer was as solid as a Kryptonian, with minimal frame delay and no freezing or lag stutters.","Not content with just being a stylish and smart fighting game, Injustice 2 delves into deeper territory with a must-play story mode for DC fans and progression systems that'll keep players coming back for more.",,,,"Injustice 2 is a lot more of what I loved about the first game. The gear really adds to the single player aspect. I find myself grinding characters and decking them out with the latest fashion. It is addictive, and will likely keep me playing for months. It is impossible to argue the value they packed into this game. Whether their style of fighting game is up your alley is another story. Injustice 2 won’t suddenly change anyone’s opinion of the developer’s work, but it will thrill fans of it.",,,,"With NetherRealm firing on all cylinders, Injustice 2 is not just a great looking comic book fighting game, but it's also a remarkably deep, gratifying and consistently entertaining one too. The gear system is great too, ensuring you'll be playing for months on end. A triumphant return for DC's heroes and villains.",,,"NetherRealm has delivered a fighting game that can be enjoyed by new players and pros alike in ways that go beyond pure competition. It's a bar that every fighting game should meet, but one that has up until now seemed out of reach.",,,"This is likely their best game since NetherRealm was founded within Warner Bros. The formula seems so perfect, it’s hard to imagine anyone not finding something to enjoy in Injustice 2. Whether you like fighting games, DC Comics, or just superheroes getting into visceral combat, this is a sequel worth checking out.",,,,,,"NetherRealm Studios has been working with the DC Comics characters for a few games now, but Injustice 2 truly shows just how well the developer understands how to best translate comics to a fighting game. Just having the likes of Gorilla Grodd and Aquaman in a fighting game would have been enough for most fans, but including as much depth in the story, loot system, online options, and customization takes Injustice 2 above and beyond. It's not all that rare for NetherRealm to have success in the fighting genre, but to accomplish this level of excellence for players of all skill levels is a fantastic achievement.",,,"This is just a beat-em-up.

Even more so, when some balancing problems have been addressed.",,,,,,,,,"As with Injustice, this sequel is far more than a fighter. It’s a love letter to DC’s heroes and villains, with each easily identifiable… yet not as you’re used to. With a variety of gear sets to earn and apply, alongside the ability to play with a host of colour schemes, Injustice 2 is also a creative playground. With fights. Good fights. If you’ve any interest in DC, or love fighters, this one’s for you.",,"If you enjoyed the original Injustice, you're pretty much a shoe-in for enjoying Injustice 2 just as much. The game enhances nearly everything from the original game. Injustice 2 has a lot of character zoning just like the first game so you'll need to get adjusted with how to deal with characters such as Deadshot or eat his bullets from long distance for an entire match. It's always hard to call out balance issues when a game first launches, but Injustice 2 seems to have less balance issues than the first game at the moment.",,,,,"These ridiculous twists on traditional aesthetics are all because of Injustice 2’s brilliant loot system, but the reason it’s brilliant isn’t because it lets you make superheroes look crazy. It’s brilliant because it’s a nod to the wackiness of DC’s multiverse on a scale that fans probably haven’t seen before outside of something like the universe-hopping opening of Crisis On Infinite Earths.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The fights are fun and flashy, with nice depth for players willing to spend the time learning those nuances. But Injustice 2 also sets a very high bar for content variety in a way that opens up the game to people who might just be fans of DC's heroes and villains, too. If you're open to the idea of a fighting game, you're almost certain to find something worth liking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While I can’t tell you whether Injustice 2 will be a hit with hard core fighter fans, I can tell you that it was a ton of fun for a guy like me, who generally doesn’t spend more than half an hour with any of the fighting games that cross my desk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fast, furious, fun and another positive adjective beginning with f, Injustice 2 is everything you need from a fighting game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’re a DC fan and want a gripping continuation of the Injustice storyline, there’s really no good reason not to fire this baby up and crack some skulls. Hey, oddball entries like Swamp Thing and Blue Beetle alone are worth the price of admission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Injustice 2 is a fantastic fighting game with great visuals that is a lot of fun to play casually but with enough depth to master. The new Multiverse mode will keep you playing for a long time while you build the perfect Batman.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Netherrealm Studios stumbling while adding an innovative new feature to Injustice 2 would have been much more tragic if the bits they normally excel at, fighting and storytelling, weren’t so spectacular this time around. Where follow-ups to traditional comic book events often fail, Injustice 2 is a worthy successor to the original in almost every way.",,,,,,,,,,,,"With a solid story mode and comprehensive tutorials, it never once feels like the fighting mechanics are too difficult to grasp. While it may not be the most technically impressive or competitive fighting game ever made, Injustice 2 surely is one of the most accessible and difficult to put down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It may not be perfect, but you won't want to miss it.",,"The gaming mechanics are almost flawless which gives the player a sturdy control system in this action RPG that successfully teleports you into this post-apocalyptic world as you search for your son and “save” the world. Sure, the story does take a back seat but this is because you create your own character and make your own story and what a story it is. Imagine being the star of I am Legend or Mad Max as you control your destiny in this nuclear devastated world.",,"The game's music is perfectly set for the different situations you find yourself in. It's suitably dramatic in the big fight scenes and similarly soft when you get to a more emotional part. Whilst not at the forefront of your attention, the music is always there and sometimes you won't even notice it until it goes silent. Your heart might be in your mouth as you hack a computer or lockpick a door with enemies nearby, and the music will do a great job to reflect exactly how you are feeling.",The biggest and most important thing to discuss is the combat. Fallout 3’s combat was lackluster and not without its share of headaches. I’m happy to report that the combat has been refined and even inspired by games like Destiny. You still have the ability to change between FPS and Third Person view on the fly. I prefer the FPS mode and you can tell Bethesda really poured their heart into making it right.,"Fallout 4 captures you in its world without ever letting you go: it still shows the series' well known soul of a collapsed world frozen in time by a nuclear blast, but this time everything is more fluid and streamlined, from objects management to dialogues to the combat system, with an added management layer and an incredibly dense and detailed world. This is the game to have for RPG lovers this autumn.",,,,"Fallout 4 is a game that will spark conversation and a huge amount of love, and there’s no reason it shouldn’t follow in the footsteps of Skyrim as something of a cultural phenomenon. The game’s only real issue is in the dated visuals, but the engine serves a purpose beyond eye-candy, and hey, we’re mostly walking through irradiated trash anyway, right...Fallout 4 is impossible not to recommend.",,,,Even the technical shakiness that crops up here and there can’t even begin to slow down its momentum.,"If you're willing to put up with some technical issues, Fallout 4 is Bethesda's most ambitious RPG to date.",,,,,,,,"Fallout 4 might not be as technically advanced as, say The Witcher 3, but it’s a game full of charm and substance, which makes up for an aging Creation Engine.

It’s a world you’re going to want to go back to, time and time again.",,,"The fact that your decisions stick with you after walking away from the game is a testament to the great storytelling on hand. Fallout 4 is an argument for substance over style, and an excellent addition to the revered open-world series.",,,,,"Bethesda's open-world strengths have always differed from its contemporaries in that focus on world-building and a sense of place above all else. Fallout 4 has all the ambiance and history that made its predecessors such wonderful places to get lost for hours at a time, with a much more coherent set of stories within it. That Bethesda has integrated a major building and crafting tool while finally building a great-playing game almost feels like a bonus.","Fallout 4 is a genuine achievement, an awesome wasteland survival simulator that suffers from familiar Bethesda problems. Clear your schedule, Fallout 4 will demand all of your spare time.","Fallout 4 isn't perfect by any means, but the sheer scope of the game as a whole and the incredibly well-structured world means that should you dare to take the plunge, you'll be swimming around in these waters for dozens, if not hundreds of hours. The bugs may threaten to spoil the show, but every time one rears its head and makes you want to stop playing, you'll feel the pangs within the hour to go back and give things another go.",,"The magnitude of the world is awe-inspiring, and even with the lukewarm additions of crafting and building, Fallout 4 manages to be as enthralling an experience as any open-world adventure to date.",,,,,"Fallout 4 is my game of the year for 2015 and I know for a fact I won’t be finished this side of the New Year. I don’t want it to be, I love being in the world, I love discovering new things and all in all I just love this game.",,,"Fallout 4 didn’t blow me away like the previous iteration did, but it did keep me thoroughly entertained and fully vested in journeying across the wasteland.",,,,,,,,,,,"In large doses, all that fighting can be tiresome, but the best thing about Fallout 4 is that it wants you to have something to fight for—more than just a vendetta, or some life-saving MacGuffin, or the player’s own bloodthirsty whims.","In creating Fallout 4, Bethesda has built upon one of the greatest games of all-time and released a very impressive and immersive sequel. It's not perfect, or the exact sequel that I was hoping for, but it's a rich and detailed experience that fans of the series will surely appreciate.",Fallout 4 is truly a remarkable experience and you need to play it.,,Fallout 4 is the epitome of what an open world RPG should be.,,,,,,,,,,,"At some point, I just want the games to work reliably. Fallout 4 follows in the footsteps of its predecessors, which is to say that it's a large, sprawling world filled with so many different quests and locations that most players will miss entire subplots as they scavenge their way from one side of the world to the other. That's also to say that it's occasionally kind of broken, from performance issues specific to the console versions to scripting glitches that might just prevent you from progressing to the same sort of ""physics gone wild"" moments that make for killer animated gifs and such.",,,,,,,,"After spending roughly 40 hours with the game, I can safely place it somewhere in the middle of Fallout 3 and New Vegas in terms of quality. A lot of the franchise's signature problems have carried over directly into Fallout 4, but all of its charms have come along for the ride as well. It manages to do a whole lot right, but the story drags at times, and glitches...glitches never change.","A (mega)ton of adventure awaits those who have the hours to fully experience Fallout 4’s beautifully devastated wasteland. Best of all, players will be able to experience it however they wish thanks to near infinite gameplay options.","Sometimes beautiful, a bit broken, and really quite brilliant in many places, forgiving fans will adore Fallout 4. [Christmas 2015, p.60]",,"In the end, Fallout 4 is essentially Fallout 3 with a few more features and tweaks. That isn't a dig at the game, but that's what most fans of the series will think.",,,Fallout 4 feels more like a Fallout 3.5: an improvement on Bethesda’s last game but a compromised one that loses some of the core appeal of the series.,,,"Fallout 4 is hugely ambitious and without a doubt one of the best games this year. It’s not without its flaws, but very few games made me care more about what I was picking up, how to use it, what choices I made, and even the communities I’d founded. By streamlining some mechanics, Bethesda has made room for other more complex ideas. If you can forgive a few technical imperfections, of which there aren’t as many as prior instalments, Fallout 4 exceeds all expectations.",,"It’s massive and compelling and at times boneheaded, but usually brilliant. Stylish, deep, story-driven, tactical, action-packed: Few if any games manage to be so many things at once, and despite some hiccups, Fallout 4 turns the end of the world into a real blast.",,"The insane amount, and variety, of content available in this game is going to make it an experience that players don’t want to walk away from for at least the next year. The graphics may hold it back from being the game that defines this console generation, but the unforgettable narrative and open-world experience are more than enough to make up for the slightly dated aesthetic.",,"Fallout 4 is not the bar-raising, generation-defining post-apocalyptic RPG for which players like me might have hoped. But – and this is a great testament to Bethesda Softworks’ ability to transport us to fantastical worlds in which we become utterly engrossed – it is nonetheless a great piece of end of the world entertainment that’s managed to keep my hands firmly on my controller and my eyes glued to the screen and for dozens of enjoyable hours over the last week...Just don’t expect to be blown away with how it looks.",,"It’s a gigantic game, with a gargantuan number of story-lines and missions, a crafting system that’s out of this world, and better gameplay when compared with its predecessor. The sheer quantity and quality of it all almost made us forget the bugs. Almost. After all, the number of glitches and hiccups we found in the game is pretty high too, and while this doesn’t really ruin the experience, it makes it imperfect. Basically, Fallout 4 is what we expected: a bigger, better, and smarter Fallout 3, and that is more than enough to make it great, even if it’s not the absolute masterpiece some were expecting.",,Fallout 4 is the most complete game Bethesda Game Studios has ever created. The studios lifted exploring a nuclear wasteland to yet another level.,,,,,,,,,"Bethesda have done it again, refining the formula for open-world RPGs and delivering a vast, deep and involving experience.",,,"The biggest letdown of Fallout 4 is that by now the engine is almost as retro as the style of the game, because this iteration has the same technical limitations Bethesda-RPG’s have had since 2006. Thankfully the story is more vivid, the customization system that handily cooperates with the building of settlements and the Power Armor is ridiculously expansive, and slightly faster gameplay makes it feel fresh enough.

n++,,,,,,,,,"One of the best platforming experiences ever with perfect mechanics and an highly challenging gameplay, now enriched with a metric ton of content.",,,,It's a sure sign of a solid platformer when deceptively simple core mechanics and basic controls result in hours of gameplay without feeling stale or repetitious. N++ achieves this splendidly. The triumph and accomplishment as you solve just ‘one more level’ of deadly physics and diabolical design is sublime and a heady swirl of emotion. Reinforcing the obsessive gameplay are instant restarts after death and virtually instantaneous level loading. Like a true platformer.,"Everything considered, N++ is an absolute gem. Anyone who wants a platformer should buy this game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"N++ may be the definition of too much of a good thing. As much as I enjoy the game, it got tiring after a while, soon finding it more enjoyable in short bursts rather than long marathons. If you're fine with a mountain of content that becomes so difficult, you'll most likely never finish it all; this is a great sequel that kept retained what was good about the last game and made some worthwhile additions. It gets repetitive, but the gameplay is so fun it'll keep pulling you back in for more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"N++ is a throwback to simpler, nicer times, in which videogames didn't need to constantly bomb the player with many button commands, or HUD elements. Its main strengths are its minimalistic visual style, and its strong -yet simple gameplay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"N++ is incredibly challenging, but never unfair (not including the insane player made levels), as controls are very precise and everything simply works the way it should. It takes some serious skill to tackle the later stages and hardcore mode, but that comes in time. There’s absolutely no shortage of levels to play, as the amount of content is baffling, again, not even including the online creator level sharing capability. I’m glad that N++ is here and in my game library, as I felt right at home ninja jumping and sliding from the get go, as it caters to the gamers that want to sit down and play for hours, or the kind that only have 10 minutes to get a few levels in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A must-have for any platforming fan. Nearly everything is perfect in this game. If the soundtrack was a bit more memorable and the game didn’t stutter when a new song played, I’d give the game a 10 without question.

dishonored-2,"A game with a beautiful world, meticulously crafted missions, and superb stealth. [Jan 2017, p.77]",,"Dishonored 2 is an improvement over the original game in every sense of the word. Its real value lies in the fact that it offers unique and rewarding game experiences for any type of player, whether you like to murder everyone on sight or prefer a more… ghostly approach.",,,,"The detailed missions, versatile powers, and atmospheric storytelling will keep you coming back for multiple playthroughs if only to learn more about the world, play with the powers, and find every last thing to either steal or kill/subdue. Simply put, Dishonored 2 is a must play for stealth fans and an easy recommendation for most gamers.","Dishonored 2 however had the high bar set for it already, and it reached it without overshooting it. It was just as good as the original, and had some great improvements that set it apart but at the end of the day felt marginally better than the amazing original. This is by no means a bad thing and is a definite testament to the skill and passion the team at Arkane have in this industry.","Dishonored 2 delivers a great sequel to Arkane's franchise, with great freedom for the player and high longevity, even if a bit too much on the conservative side. We would have liked to see more outstanding missions like the Clockwork Mansion and the Timepiece ones.",,,"Dishonored 2 is an amazing game. Played entirely in first-person, the freedom it bestows players closely resembles that of the Elder Scrolls games. Although the game is broken up into distinct levels rather than an open world, each chapter is huge and filled with atmosphere, detail, and myriad nooks and crannies to explore. The Empire really feels like a believable steampunk world, one with countless stories to tell.",,,,,"Dishonored 2 is tough in its first few chapters, and - in particular - made me work for those runes, which are more-often-than-not surrounded by hostile NPCs - tricky if you want a low-chaos playthrough. It’s fun to work for it in the face of high-chaos temptation.","Trumping the first in nearly every way, Dishonored 2 is at the very top of the list of ""must play"" first-person action games in 2016. Causing bloody chaos or sticking to the shadows, Arkane gives players the tools to run wild in this new world. This brand of gameplay combined with a beautiful presentation and plenty of customization leads to fun playthroughs of Dishonored 2 whether its your first time or your fifth.",,"Dishonored 2 is a bloody good game that builds upon the groundwork of its predecessor in many ways, but still remains perplexing in its stance of making you feel like you’re playing it wrong if you choose a playstyle that’s anything other than pure stealth.",,"Dishonored 2 is a great game that builds a believable world and lets the player use it as a playground. For those wanting a straight-ahead action game, this is not it, and even more so than the first, stealth is highly recommended. Still it is impossible to argue just how well the team has executed their vision. Crafting one of the most unique and engrossing experiences once again.",,,,"Dishonored was a genuine surprise when it launched four years ago; an innovative first-person experience that confounded expectations. That Dishonored 2 manages to once again surprise and amaze as much as the first game did is testament to what Arkane has crafted here. Dishonored 2 is quite simply one of the greatest games this year, and quite possibly one of the best of this generation.",,,,,,,"The story of Dishonored 2 never quite rises to the heights of the game world and the gameplay, but it’s solid nonetheless. And that’s just fine. Because so much else of Dishonored 2 is riveting. Especially the matters that involve killing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dishonored 2 is at its best when it pushes beyond its comfort zone with standout missions like the Clockwork Mansion and Stilton’s Manor. Each introduces a room- and time-shifting mechanic, respectively, that increases the navigational challenge and opens up new opportunities for clever takedowns.",,,,"Emily injects new abilities, alongside some different weapon upgrades. There are excellent new environments to go with a similar story that doesn’t really go anywhere; it’s almost a clone of Corvo’s original desire to clear his name of wrongdoings amidst a powerplay. It makes for a very good action-stealth adventure that genuinely encourages playing by your own rules. But whereas we praised Dishonored 1 for being one of the most unique triple-A games of last-generation, that inherently isn’t the case with its very good, but very safe, sequel.",,"Overall I found the game deeply fascinating, engrossing, and thoroughly enjoyable, and it comes highly recommended to fans of action games.",,,,,,"Dishonored 2 had a lot of high expectations to live up to, and it does so admirably. Not only is it a great game in its own right, but it also exists as a fantastic sequel that expands upon its predecessor in multiple memorable ways.","The universe’s mysticism is enthralling, with countess ways to enjoy it. Everything that worked so well in the first game—its fantastic level design, supernatural powers, world building, and lore—are all present with even greater impact. It’s evident that Arkane put a lot of time and energy into designing the entire game to create a truly incredible experience.",,,,,"Dishonored 2 isn't just a great story. It's actually the same story, but hasn't lost any luster in the retelling. It has some of the best stealth we've seen this generation, buffeted by empowering, extraordinary powers, peerless level design, and intriguing characters. Arkane did the same thing this time around, only better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dishonored 2 tries to take on so much that it can't actually keep up with itself, even on PC. If Arkane can get a handle on the optimization and delivers a DLC campaign that's on par with the original's take on Daud, it'll be one of the easiest recommendations I've made all year.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Dishonored 2 puts its money in the right places, offering finely-tuned gameplay that’s as challenging as it is thrilling. For a game all about choice, the decision to add this sneaky genius to your collection is a no-brainer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dishonored was already amazing, and this sequel bests it on every level.",,,"Dishonored 2 is not without its issues, but they pale considerably against the empowering free-form stealth, exhilarating combat and immersive atmosphere. Rise up, take back what’s yours, and have a ball doing it.",,,,,,,,,,,,"A memorable experience that encourages exploration and experimentation, something not many developers can pull off well.",,,,"Dishonored 2's world is big and very detailed with multiple paths and ways to go about it. There are many secrets to discover and puzzles to solve. If you are a fan of the original, then this is the perfect sequel. A great game with the right amount of new techniques and ideas to provide new gamers and fans of the original with a great experience.",,"Dishonored 2 is a great game for those who never played the first game and for returning gamers who enjoyed Dishonored. Its challenging gameplay, collectibles and the ability to experience the game’s story from two different points of view are more than enough to keep you interested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dishonored 2 is just the latest example in a long line of games that continue to illustrate the close relationship between quality stealth games and emergent gameplay. Any given playthrough will present you with myriad chances to both create and react to opportunities, many of which appear with little to no warning. It's in surviving these situations (preferably undetected) where Dishonored 2 delivers its most tangible rushes and most profound sense of gratification. It's a tale of vengeance that's presented in an imaginatively conceived world, one that is as threatening as it is inviting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The end result is one that will stay with you for years to come, and although it’s hard to say goodbye, The Banner Saga goes out with an emotional-toying bang.","It's true that from an innovation standpoint, The Banner Saga 3 doesn't do a lot different than its predecessors, but that also means the same great tactical RPG system that has been in place since the beginning makes one final push for the endgame. That endgame is what really makes the game so worthwhile.

The hellish soundtrack and unforgiving fast-paced encounters will keep your adrenaline pumping and your senses sharp.,,,,,,,DOOM Eternal proves now more than ever that the grandaddy of the first-person shooter genre is once again the king of them all -- and it doesn't look to be ceding the throne any time soon.,,,,,,,,,"The Doom series has once again sat upon the throne and been crowned as the best FPS series in history. With extremely fast pace, adrenaline pumping, warcry inspiring gameplay, gorgeous yet gruesome visuals, and a story that makes the player feel like a god, Doom Eternal sets the bar extremely high for any developer looking to compete for the crown of “Best FPS game in history.” But that multiplayer emphasis makes the atrocities of Battlemode even worse then they would have been otherwise and may keep Doom Eternal from achieving immortality.","A great, if disjointed, continuation of the demon killing franchise. Visually stunning, tight controls and satisfying combat make for an exciting and enjoyable experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Id Software’s magnum opus, an epic of the videogame world that’ll be talked about for years to come, Doom Eternal is a triumph. It elevates everything that made Doom 2016 such a success, and keeps the pressure up from the opening minutes to the climactic final boss and falters only ever so occasionally en route. One of 2020’s first essential games, Doom Eternal is a masterwork of first-person shooter design, and sets the bar for what developers should be doing in the genre.","A far more brutal experience than its predecessor, Doom Eternal isn’t for the weak, but master the ruleset and you’re in for a hell of a time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-+-2,,,"Remaking games is not easy, but once again, Activision and Vicarious Visions deliver a great experience. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 fell as good as its original versions, but at the same time, they adopt some things that the franchise learned along the way. Is nice to see that such a beloved series came back in such a good way.",,,"All in then, Vicarious Visions and Beenox have absolutely knocked this remake out of the park. Not only is it a great source of nostalgia for older players who have fond memories of the originals, but the core gameplay is just as fun as ever and will no doubt find a new legion of fans today. The updated visuals are excellent, again playing homage to past titles while adding extra little touches and details. Online is fun, if a challenge, and the custom skater and park options are deep and full of potential, though it would have been nice to be able to set custom challenges too.","Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a shining example of how to do a remake properly, and sits in stark contrast to the last woeful effort to revisit these classics, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD. Vicarious Visions demonstrates a wonderful understanding of what needs updating and what should be held sacred, even to the point that the team has bitten the bullet and let the lesser stages (yes, of course we mean you, Downhill Jam) stay bad just so the classics can stay superb without laying a finger on any of the layouts.",,"Vicarious Visions managed to do justice to the first two iconic Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games, adding new content and refreshing the gameplay mechanics. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a remastering masterwork and a game everyone should try.","Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 is a brand new game far away from the 2012 remaster for old-gen platforms, it's a perfectly done remake made from the start to offer a perfectly balanced game that old players will surely enjoy and celebrate. Also adds some optional content adapted to the new times and new players. All the content from the original two games, including its OST (mostly) are in, as well as powerful 4K+ 60fps graphics with new models, animations and brand new tracks design. This new remake is one of the best game in the series, if not the best. Ladies and gentlemen, these are great times, the king is back.",The best skateboarding arcade ever made. Essential for the lovers of this sport.,,"If you’ve ever played either game or the series before, you know what you’re in for, it’s just more. If you haven’t and this is your first time dropping in -- don’t be scared, the opposite transition awaits and gravity will take hold in that this series will launch you to new, fun and endearing heights.","For what it is trying to do, it is hard to fault Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 on Xbox One for practically anything it does. It accurately and lovingly recreates the original games whilst adding tons of new content and ideas - it just perfects the formula.",,,"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 is such a tremendous turnaround from 2015’s disastrously dismal Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 5 that it’s difficult to believe they share even a shred of DNA. The accessible yet tricky skating is earnest and old-school fun, the wonderful looking levels are lovingly designed odes to the past, and the music is like the hearty embrace of an old childhood buddy. It’s pretty easy to be cynical about how rapidly selling us our favourite games again became a central pillar of Activision’s business strategy, but when it’s this much fun I’m finding it impossible to be sour about it. It turns out going backwards has been the best step forward Activision has taken with the Tony Hawk series in nearly 15 years.","After falling off the board entirely with Tony Hawk's previous outing, Activision has successfully gone back to the beginning and proven again what once made the series so iconic with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2.",,,,"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 is one of the best remakes of two of the best video games ever made. For fans like me who grew up playing it, this is what we have wanted since the series started its downward spiral in its later years. It feels like Tony Hawk is back for the first time in a decade. For those not familiar this is the best way to jump into the action. This package is incredible, and I hope Activision expands it with DLC for Tony Hawk 3+4 at some point down the line.",,,,"As far as immediate arcade thrills go, few games can compete with the level of gratification you're guaranteed to get from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2. If you enjoyed the originals or fancy seeing what all the fuss is about, you're in for an absolute treat either way.",The one and only tangible addition to the studio is a rather messy and cumbersome experience and challenge system that won't get you much except cosmetic items in the hundreds. The pleasure and the sensations are there. But it would have taken a little more to make an impression.,,"Because it nails so much about that original Tony Hawk experience, it's really hard to be mad at Pro Skater 1 + 2 for any of its downsides. The load times aren't enough to keep you away from the plethora of satisfying combos, and the lack of level goals for every skater isn't enough to keep you from jumping back in with a new character. Playing through the newly remade levels is immensely enjoyable, and that on its own is enough to call Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 a success. However, smart additions and an engaging challenge system make it an experience that's more than just a brief skate through Tony Hawk's past.",,,,,"Everything I love about the original is still here; it’s just a little older, a little kinder, and a lot better looking.",,"The greatest compliment we can give to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is that it's a very faithful remake of the original two classics. And for the first time in a long time, the franchise feels fresh again. The game does a great job at recapturing the magic of Pro Skater's early days while also modernising them for the current generation (despite a couple of wobbles), and now we can't wait to see where Activision takes the series next. Welcome back, Tony!",,,,,Visually as well as mechanically very successful remaster of two skateboard classics. The Tony Hawk franchise hasn’t been served with this quality in a very long time.,,,,,,,,"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a one-way ticket to the turn of the millennium. It's a complete, beautiful love letter to not only Tony Hawk himself as an icon but to a time when both the series and the sport of skateboarding itself were most pure and fun. As a bundle, and with the multiplayer providing even more longevity, this game offers unrivalled value.","As a recreation it highlights how good the original games were for their time. Challenging, original, addictive and damn fun to play. If you’re in your 30s, it’s absolutely worth a trip down memory lane. If you were born after the original games were released, give it a crack, even if only for the opportunity to experience some quality video game history. You’ll probably find you’ve been working on a perfect line or combo for a few hours before you realise it.","Activision have continued their revival of 'old-meets-new' with the latest Tony Hawk instalment. For all intents and purposes, it retains the charm and thrills from the original while adding on new quality of life bells and whistles. It hits the nostalgia notes whilst also completely revamping the stages, soundtrack, player models and almost everything else imaginable. This is now the definitive method to enjoy the first two games in this iconic franchise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 is the package fans have been waiting years for. They missed the mark with the HD remake, and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 5, but I’m happy to report Vicarious Visions and Activision have perfectly rebuilt the original two Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater titles from the ground up. There are plenty of new things added to the reimagining of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games, and they’re all welcome additions. Nothing feels out of place and includes a lot more content than expected. Time has flown by through my first playthrough of the two campaigns, and I know I’m just getting started with all of the online and local multiplayer potential. This great package leaves me wanting more.","The Tony Hawk series was never about realism, and whether they’re old enough to have nostalgia for it or not, Pro Skater 1+2 is a fantastic remake offering intuitive and massively enjoyable gameplay that deserves any skate fan’s attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"More than a simple coat of paint, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 not only brings back that nostalgia and great memories growing up playing every chance I could, but modernizes many of its fundamentals without completely changing everything about the classics that made it so great in the first place. For fans of the classics like myself, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 is a perfect example of how to preserve its original essence as to what made it so great in the first place but adding many improvements at the same time, and for newcomers, there’s no better arcade skate game out there on the market today.",,,,,,,,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 proves that video games aren't really getting much better than what was around at the turn of the millennium. In fact, the amount of fun to be had here makes most modern games feel sterile and unstimulating in comparison.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Even with all its changes, THPS1+2 perfectly captures a moment in time. It’s a damaged Polaroid photo scanned, digitized, and lovingly retouched. It’s gravel picked out of a scraped knee. It’s a night of sleep untouched by nightmares and insomnia. It is, as it always was, just what I need in this moment.",,,,,,"This is what we need with a game so called 'remake'. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater does everything that made the original 2 games outstanding, and improves them in every single way, making this offer even more than that it once was. You can start with the new graphics, the improved soundtrack or its excellent gameplay. Perfect for those who played the original games, but also great for a new audience.",,,,,,,,,,"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 is one of the best examples of a video game remake. Not only has Vicarious Visions retained what made the games so well-crafted to begin with, but it has reminded us why a series with such refined gameplay should not just be left in the past. Though its character creation and multiplayer could do with some more attention, the addictive gameplay, stunning graphics and pitch-perfect sound ensure that the series has been given a new life. I cannot wait to see where it will be taken next, be it a remake of Pro Skater 3 and 4, or an entirely new entry – either way, I’ll be there. Welcome back, Birdman.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, if, you’re like me, with a backlog of games that goes back to the beginning of the year, choose your games to play wisely and put Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus on the top of your priority list. You won’t be disappointed.",MachineGames raises the bar with a great narrative experience coupled with an highly fulfilling old-school gameplay. An unmissable game for lovers of single player FPS experiences.,"Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus doesn’t care if it should sell its soul to the devil in exchange for more fun, fanservice or squashing Nazis patrols. Games can provide us with all kinds of experiences, but let's not forget that killing nazis will remain always on top.","Machine Games and Bethesda surprise us with the second title of Wolfenstein, which is so entertaining that we didn't think it was so necessary. Thanks to the id Tech 6 engine and a development that catches the player, we are facing one of the best shooters of this generation.","Wolfenstein II is a glorious single-player experience that stands proud in a AAA industry that seems increasingly obsessed with multiplayer and ""Games as a Service"" business models. Wolfenstein II is a pure experience that shooter fans cannot afford to miss.",,"Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is another example of how to do a FPS game right, and even though the single player format may not be as popular as it once was, Wolfenstein II delivers much of what many of us would love to see more of in the future.",,,"Everything that made Wolfenstein: The New Order an excellent single-player first-person shooter is dialed up for round two. With a cast of instantly likeable heroes and bone-chilling villains giving emotional context to its bloody uprising against high-tech Nazis, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus has come to play.","We've already seen that Machine Games can craft a great playing shooter, but with Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus they've also got a more interesting and varied story to tell this time around.",,"Bigger, bolder and somehow a hell of a lot more outlandish than The New Order, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus’ imperfections do little to hold the game back from being one of the most compelling single player games of the year. Killing Nazis has rarely been any more fun, and there’s a whole army of them for you to dispose of as you please when you’re not starring slack-jawed at some of the most over-the-top cutscenes ever created.","In 2014 MachineGames made a statement with Wolfenstein: The New Order. Now, with Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, they’ve written their manifesto. It’s easily one of the best games you’ll play all year.","In the end, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus is a fun first person shooter with some issues here and there that was just enough to get on my nerves. It doesn’t shy away from the hard subjects, in both the story and the gameplay, and I think that anyone who enjoys a good FPS should pick this one up. It’s well worth the time and money even with the issues it has.",,,,"Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a stellar follow-up to MachineGames’ 2014 reboot of the franchise, one with super-satisfying combat and a wacky, engaging story. Sure, it might go a little too far at times, but you’ll have a blast with The New Colossus from start to finish, that’s a promise.",,,"The New Colossus never lets you forget who and why you're fighting. Nazi brutality is on full display, from the blown-out, irradiated remains of Manhattan to each of the resistance members, who all carry mental scars if not physical ones. You're never given a chance between cutscenes, missions, and even downtime on the U-boat to lose sight of the Reich's cruelty. Wolfenstein's tense gameplay elevates this further by giving you the power to truly resist--and come out of each battle ready for another fight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite some heavy patriotic messages that may sometimes distract the narrative, killing nazis is as fun as ever. Wolfenstein II expands over his predecessor with a rampage of old-school brutality, dual-wielding ass-kicking kills that makes it as one of the finest single player shooters of the recent days and a truly joyful experience. Highly recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Its carefully crafted story and dialogue rolls back and forth between the farcical lunacy for which the series has always been known – outlandish military science, over-the-top villains, and a heaping helping of gore – and moments of authentic emotion in which Blazkowicz is downright soulful, musing to himself on the afterlife, love, and family as though he were a character in a Terrence Malick film.",,,,,"Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus wraps up the feeling of a blockbuster movie in something you can interact with. There's a lot of games that do that, but the spectacle here is outstanding, and the fast-paced gunplay and compelling main story made me want more when the credits rolled. Killing Nazis is one of the most fun and wholesome things a person can do, and there's no better way than to do it with Wolfenstein 2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A far deeper game than its B-movie stylings would imply at a glance, Wolfenstein II also delights with its fast-paced, creative first-person warfare. Its tongue-in-cheek social commentary is heavy-handed, but there are few other games where mowing down the bad guys feels so cathartic or warranted. The New Colossus also pulls off the rare trick of being a sequel that more than lives up to the standard set by its predecessor, making this a real treat for returning players. Not to be missed.","Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus brings gamers around the world and single player, first person shooter that delivers a fantastic storyline, beautiful graphics, and an experience that is hard to surpass on any platform. Bethesda and MachineGames have done a tremendous job in showcasing evil exists in the world, the fight that good people have to go through to prevent this evil from taking hold, and what happens when good people do absolutely nothing. This game is easily a contender for game of the year, with only a few shortcomings, and I expect to see Wolfenstein II make a serious case for why they deserve the crown.",,,,"Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus isn't that much different from the last installment, but great visual/audio elements with strong encounters design keep the experience fresh. Highly recommended for fps fans.",,,,,,,,,"Wolfenstein II: The New Order is almost great but is held back by a number of issues. A few design choices Machine Games made far too often took me out of the game and frustrated me to no end. For such a great feeling game, the lack of damage indicators to and from enemies made the game feel off far too many times. An outdated health system forced me to play the game differently than I wanted to. Instead of the clear intent at fast paced chaotic action the game does so well, I was too often hiding behind cover, scouring for health packs, and dying in seconds due to frequent difficulty spikes. Even with these issues, I still had an overall positive experience with the game due to strong story beats and chaotic moment to moment action. Wolfenstein II is a game I would recommend to anyone but is a game that may leave you feeling a bit frustrated in the end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Offering an epic atmosphere along with interactive, psychological story-telling, Hellblade takes you on an unprecedented journey, and aims for your feelings in the process.",,,,"Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice’s most riveting achievement isn’t how well it functions, nor how well it’s written and voiced, nor how well it looks, but how well all of that unifies into such a dark and compelling experience. The constant tension throughout the entirety of this unique and engaging journey will disturb you, intrigue you and stay with you, long after the credits roll.","Senua is fierce and imperfect in a way that will have you rooting for her like few characters ever garner. Her journey is pretty much unceasingly filthy, violent, tragic and horrific, yet it's not a story of suffering, but rather one of perseverance. Senua is a remarkable character who instills all of her energies into the player in such a way that will never be forgotten.",,"Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice masterfully renders human insanity, introducing a very delicate topic in the gaming world. It succeeds in this thanks to great visual and audio production and brilliant acting. It could have been more varied and refined gameplay wise, but lovers of narrative-focused action adventures will love it.","Hellblade is a unique production. Risky and brave, the game has the DNA of an independent game that is covered under a layer of paint who has a super production. It is one of those games that you must have on your system.","Hellblade is one of the best interactive experiences of this generation and a true technical show. However, the gameplay of the game is not equally calibrated and often loses pace in some areas.","Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is a great game which lives up to Ninja Theory's strong history of producing excellent action titles like DmC: Devil May Cry, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, and Heavenly Sword. Its approach to presenting mental illness in a way many people can understand is also remarkable. The use of stellar voice acting enhances the experience and gives it a ""AAA"" feel despite the fact that it costs a fraction of that.",,"Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice is a must buy for all gamers, especially those who love character, story and adventure. The performance, design, and journey are all amazing and the gameplay is hugely enjoyable as well, with a little bit of a challenge thrown in for good measure.",,,,,,,,"Hellblade is an amazing achievement in game design. It is something I think everyone should play. Again, I cannot stress enough to do it with headphones on and immerse yourself into its world. It is games like this that really showcase what talented developers can achieve. It is also worth mentioning that proceeds from the Xbox One sales are going to mental health research, so yeah, buy this amazing title already.",,,,"Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice is a harrowing journey into the fragility of the mind. It’s a masterpiece in storytelling, and while the game mechanics itself might not complement that throughout, they do a decent job of allowing Ninja Theory to deliver a mature story revolving around a sensitive subject matter. We hope that this opens up the door for more budget priced triple-A experiences, because this one was one hell of a ride!","Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice takes us on a long road to hell paved with contemplative yet stressful scenes, and an impressive respect for Norse myths and legends.",,Hellblade's most notable achievement is the handling of an incredibly sensitive subject matter within an engaging and well-crafted action/adventure game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As a game, Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice is the cross between a puzzle-lite walking simulator and a brutal action-adventure. Despite some mild design and middling technical flaws, it balances both aspects rather well. As a narrative, this is one fantastic experience. It’s an honest, challenging look at battling mental illness that will stick with you long after the credits roll. It’s as beautiful as it is soul-crushing, making it a must play for anyone who still has a soul to crush.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Offering exactly the same contents of the PS4 version, Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice on Xbox comes as a no brainer for the ones who love narrative and mature themes in a videogame, but may not be so palatable for the ones who primarily ask interactivity to a game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"You may think you know what it’s like to hear voices in your head, but Hellblade will allow you to experience it in a very raw and frightening manner, yet also being respectful to the mental illness, shedding light on the disorder. It just happens to also be an amazing game at the same time, again, with the best audio design I’ve ever experienced before, something Ninja Theory should be commended for in every way.",,,,,,,,"As an interactive story, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is in a class of its own. However, as a video game, it merely provides basic puzzles and combat that both end up feeling far too repetitive and tedious.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hellblade Senua’s Sacrifice is a hauntingly beautiful journey through the madness of a warrior’s suffering to find her true love.

deaths-door,,,,,,,,"I was extremely impressed with Death’s Door from start to finish, and would absolutely implore you to check it out when it launches this week. Again, it’s just one of those games that was extremely hard to put down in order to write this review, and I’m already looking forward to going back and trying to suss out the additional secrets and puzzles I have yet to solve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While Death's Door borrows a lot of elements from many other games, it mashes them all together and refines them into its own thing. Not one single element feels undercooked and the result is a mysterious world you'll instantly be lost within. Outside of the odd frame dip in certain situations, we absolutely loved Death's Door. It's a game filled with surprises, nods, humour, and moves at such a pace we could barely put the controller down. Games this well-crafted don't come along very often, but when they do, they're something to celebrate. Death's Door deserves all the attention it will most likely get, and is a contender for one of 2021's best games.",,,,,,,,,,"Death’s Door is more lighthearted than it looks, and that’s to its benefit. These amusing moments complement weightier themes about respecting the dead (no matter how terrible they were in life), the fear of death’s inevitability, and whether anything we accomplish truly matters when our time is limited. Death’s Door isn’t the most profoundly written story, but it handles these sensitive topics well. My favorite moments, outside of the moment-to-moment action and exploration, are when it reminds us that death isn’t something to be feared. Rather, it’s just a necessary step in the cycle of life; a cycle that cannot exist without it.",,,,,,,,,,"Happily, Death’s Door, the new action adventure game about a hard-working, soul-reaping crow is very much a love letter to the old Zelda games. Its mechanics are satisfying in a chip-off-the-old block way, its visuals are a delight and its story line is touched with assured, easygoing humor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Death’s Door is a masterclass in level design. The interwoven areas encourage and reward exploration, whilst the simple yet challenging combat makes confrontations a thrill. With an alluring art style, sorrowful soundtrack, Acid Nerve has managed to create one of the greatest indie titles of 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As a game reviewer, I assumed I was bad at games so how on earth did I find Death's Door to be an unchallenging and somewhat unsatisfying experience? Whatever the reason, it's still a good game and I enjoyed mercilessly slaughtering its unique bosses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Though a short game, there has been so much thought put into Death’s Door. Even Crow’s smallest of movements are so cute and bird-like. I wish there was more because ten hours just isn’t enough! The humor is splendid, and the mysteries waiting to be uncovered are so tantalizing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An inventive isometric slasher, Death’s Door feels like all the best bits of Souls-like structure and none of the bad. Its Zelda-inspired combat and systems are firmly at the challenging end of the spectrum, but are also pretty addictive, and mix well with a bleak yet unique story.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
devil-may-cry-5,"At 15 hours long, and with the unlockable Son Of Sparta mode upping the difficulty while switching enemies around, Dante’s latest is both stylish and generously stuffed. Though occasionally intimidating and repetitive in places, you’ll still relish making Satan sing.","In a generation that playing a good Hack 'n' Slash is like a dream, Devil May Cry 5 offers you a great, fun experience. DMC5 attracts you from the start and keeps the fun all way to the end thanks to its solid gameplay formula, and although some minor issues prevent it from reaching the series former glory, DMC5 is still the best choice for fans of HnS at the moment.","Devil May Cry 5 is an excellent return to the basics and pure gameplay, but taken to a new level thanks to current technology. With a proposal full of action, fun and motivated, Capcom has succeeded in a new account and has been one of the best games of 2019.","Devil May Cry 5 is a solid game, and one I'd heartily recommend for anyone who once loved or has interest in the series. For those looking for something more than a beautiful brawler to sink a dozen hours into, you may want to wait for a sale.",,"The devil you know is back, and it’s more diverse, more energetic, and more stylish than ever before. Devil May Cry 5 is quite simply enthralling across all aspects of its fast-paced and varied gameplay, and comes with a story that’s not only interesting, but well written and superbly voiced. Despite some minor issues with delayed rendering, the Sons of Sparda saga couldn’t have concluded in a better way.","Devil May Cry 5 is so successful because it is impeccably designed from top to bottom with one goal in mind: be awesome. It knocks that goal out of the park in nearly every element of the game. Nero and Dante each bring something unique to the combat while still maintaining the trademark feel of the series, with plenty of depth to ensure they feel awesome to play. The enemies follow suit, ensuring every battle has plenty of challenge, and the boss battles are almost all excellent. The story is backed up by flashy set pieces that are fun to watch, though I’ll admit the story itself is not particularly good in any way. The only major negatives are that the new character V seems unbalanced and doesn’t control well and that the Bloody Palace mode has been left off the feature list. Devil May Cry 5 is excellent and you won’t be disappointed.",,"Devil May Cry 5 manages to bring back Dante and friends at the very top of the stylish action games genre with over-the top action, great variety, a compelling story and a great art directions coupled with spectacular graphics. This definitely is the masterwork every fan was hoping it to be, and the glorious come-back the series deserved.","Devil May Cry 5 brings us back everything we wanted: the purest of hack and slash, action and style. One of the most complete games in the franchise and one that is perfect for newcomers. Despite some issues that prevent Devil May Cry 5 from being a perfect game, Capcom has done an impeccable job with the franchise. Long live the sons of Sparda.",Devil May Cry V rises above the rest of Hack And Slash and by its own merits becomes the current benchmark of the genre.,A fun game — one that is utterly spectacular — but Capcom could've done more to evolve the franchise's format.,"The problem isn’t that it’s too linear, it’s just that the balance is off. The combat variety across the three main characters bleeds into the storytelling and the relationships depicted across the lengthy story and wonderfully insane cinematics. With skill progression and hidden challenge stages to discover there’s reason to go back and tackle higher difficulties or certain missions from a different perspective. But there are diminishing returns when trade-in surprising story-beats and character moments for lacklustre level design and not enough variety in the locations you do battle.","Devil May Cry 5 gracefully inherits the very best narrative aspects from Devil May Cry 3 and even surpasses it in some regards. It features some of the best music and characters in the whole series, along with a multitude of new weapons and abilities, and it sets a new bar of quality and content for upcoming entries, which, I hope, will act as a template for what we can expect from the series in the future.","This is the best Devil May Cry yet. Each character has enough depth to fill a game by themselves, the story does exactly what it needs to, the twists and turns keep you on edge and the combat sets a new benchmark for action games as a whole. Capcom has made a masterclass in stylish combat gaming here, and there’s enough content to keep players happy — even if it takes another 11 years for a sequel.",,"The question of which Devil May Cry game is the best has gotten much easier with Devil May Cry 5. The combat is the strongest the series has seen to date, the story does a great job of balancing all three of its main characters and doling out rewarding bits of its mysterious story at an enticing pace, and the unlockable difficulties, sheer number of techniques to earn, and the upcoming free Bloody Palace DLC will provide a ton of incentive for replayability. It’s good to have you back, Dante and Nero.","Despite the questionable monetization, Devil May Cry V is an impressive game on the presentation front and a deep hack and slash with a ton of moves, combos, and weapons to master across three unique characters.",,"It speaks volumes that despite Devil May Cry 5‘s obvious issues, it still impresses so much. It’s a game that looks better than anything else available at the moment, and yet somehow runs at a solid 60 frames per second. And its combat is undoubtedly the deepest of any action game, making its linear structure actually not that much of an issue. Devil May Cry 5 isn’t perfect, but it’s a damn good Devil May Cry game. Honestly, I think Ninja Theory’s DmC was better, but in 2019 I’ll accept Devil May Cry 5 with open arms.","DMC 5 is probably the best hack-and-slash game you’ll play all year, and definitely the most stylish.","Devil May Cry 5 is a return to the series in its truest form. Capcom has been a massive hot streak lately and I cannot wait to see what they do next. I loved DmC and thought it was a solid reboot, but I feel like continuing the original series was the right move. The combat feels great, the game looks outstanding, and the nostalgia is strong with this one. Capcom already has two game of the year contenders on its hands and it is only March.",,,,"A triumphant return for Capcom's coolest series, Devil May Cry 5 is a stupidly slick game that does almost everything right. It'll totally pull your Devil Trigger.","Without being perfect, especially with respect to the camera handling and lock system, Devil May Cry 5 is an amazing action game with strong playable characters and a great sense of challenge and polish.","Distilling everything that's made the series great to this point and offering a razor sharp modern take on the combo-heavy character action genre that DMC helped instigate, Devil May Cry 5 is a juvenile-yet-very-adult game for those who like their monsters grotesque, their combat stylish and their demon-hunting boys and girls dumb but outrageously sexy.",DMC5 proves the series can still be brilliant and imaginative without compromising its longest-held traditions.,"Devil May Cry 5 revels in its own gleeful stupidity, presenting a world in which the most valuable commodity is style.",,,,"Devil May Cry 5 is truly, madly, deeply itself. I can’t think of any other game in which I can slice through flying demons while my panther familiar transforms into a spinning wheel of bladed death as metal guitar licks screech across rain-soaked streets. I’m not interested in perfection in that situation; I’m interested in fun. And Devil May Cry 5 is fun.",,,,,,"Devil May Cry is back in all its glory, but it isn’t stuck in its own past. There are new features galore and everything works together like a well-oiled clockwork.","Kudos to Capcom for injecting their stylish action with new life, thus making it a fierce competition for Platinums beautiful witch Bayonetta - in theory. But the “Insert Coin” mentality in the polarizing area of microtransactions needs to be adressed.",,,"While the story feels rushed, and a couple missions could have been compressed into a singular one, Capcom has crafted a well-designed and finely-tuned structure that encourages exploration and experimentation.",,"For all of its pacing issues, Devil May Cry 5 is still a lot of fun to play. Combat is a blast, and the cutscenes are delightfully absurd; fans of Devil May Cry 3 and 4 should feel right at home here. Capcom goes back to the baseline action I’ve always enjoyed, and executes that with the series’ signature over-the-top style. However, this entry’s changes and additions to that core experience don’t enhance what the series does well; they feel more like roadblocks than steps forward.",,,"Devil May Cry 5 rights all the wrongs of its predecessors with style and gusto, whilst being incredibly welcoming to series newcomers. The three playable characters bring great combat variety against the games huge slew of enemies and bosses. There are a few little niggles that stop the game from being the best it could be, but Devil May Cry 5 is undoubtedly one of the best in the series.","People come to the franchise for combat and, despite its flaws, that's precisely what Devil May Cry 5 excels at. I personally still prefer Ninja Theory's take on proceedings and hope we'll see a continuation of that world next; I definitely appreciate new ideas and takes on this well established franchise.",,"Devil May Cry 5 doesn't just carry the torch of the series after DMC4, it devil triggers and flies away with that torch.","DMC5 makes even better what this franchise does best, improving on its formula in almost every way, but doesn't do anything new In the process. The game doesn't has any hiccups or problems, so if you are the kind of gamer that loves these frantic action games, you'll be more than happy with Capcom's latest creation.","Devil May Cry 5 is a solid, addictive and visually satisfying entry in the DMC series. With a little bit more content, it would have been an even better game.",,It’s not very nourishing but it may satisfy a special craving.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Devil May Cry 5 is a very good and engaging episode for the lovable franchise. All three playable characters feel great, and you really should try it if you're a fan of the beat-them-all genre.","Capcom fills fans' dark souls with light! Devil May Cry 5 is an excellent return to form for the franchise, setting it up for a bright future. Nero's here, Dante's back in pitch-perfect form, and V provides a brand-new style of play. All Capcom really needed to do with Devil May Cry 5 was repackage the classic DMC gameplay with a modern coat of paint, but DMC 5 is an excellent, thoughtful update.",,"DMC5 is not perfect and has faults that keep it from being a memorable title as it has constant loading screens, problems with its camera and a modest variety of content in terms of replay. But outside of these, we have no doubt that it is a great action title that has everything to be among the best of the year.",,,"Devil May Cry 5 is one of the most stylish, varied and solid hack and slash games in recent times. Dante returns greater than ever, and Nero asserts his rights as cool and convincing demon hunter. Also, this could be the best performance of the RE Engine so far.",,"Exalted, rocking, technical, pleasantly excessive, the action of the game conquers and wins from the beginning to the end, almost always without reserve: apart from a slight imbalance of the old protagonist, Capcom has assembled a combat system that sits effortlessly at the top of the action game, in terms of diversity and depth.",,This is the sort of fine-tuned wacky action game the genre deserves.,,,"Lavish pop-goth theatrics and profusely ridiculous violence compose the bible to which Devil May Cry 5 remains unabashedly faithful. Whether engaging with micro-intricacies buried deep inside its three protagonists or simply opting for maladroit participation, both approaches are furiously consumed with making the player look and feel extraordinary. Devil May Cry 5 is flexible, confident, and genuine Devil May Cry.","Devil May Cry 5 is a must-play title for action fans. The action is fast and fluid, and its accommodations for both skilled and new players make it easier for everyone to enjoy the gameplay. The title is packed with a healthy amount of levels and several different hooks to keep you playing after you finish the campaign. The presentation is stunning, and while the game does contain microtransactions, they can easily be ignored. Capcom has another winner on its hands, and DMC5 is an early contender for game of the year.","A classic reborn in wonderful style. Capcom's hot streak continues apace. [Issue#331, p.106]",,,,"DMC 5 is beautifully rendered and the action is fun. However, the weak story and less-than-compelling character development and audio presentation remove the game's heart. Instead of being a masterful and complete action game, it's instead far more shallow than it could have been.","Hideaki Itsuno, my hat goes off to you and your crew. It's only March, and yet Devil May Cry 5 is another clear Game of the Year contender. The silly arguments on whether the original DMC or DmC is better can stop now, because DMC5 is here and it’s bloody brilliant. This is a proper return to form for the series, something that fans of both can get behind.","The wait between Devil May Cry 4 and Devil May Cry 5 might have been long, but the payoff is more than worth it. It doesn't deviate from the series' formula, but instead refines it to a polished sheen; one that's packed with an absurd amount of style and spirit. This is a must-play action game for fans of the series and the genre alike.",,,"From its superb visual presentation to its wildly successful combat system, Devil May Cry 5 is the perfect action game. The developers put all their energy into providing a constant string of exciting, over-the-top battles that push players to the limit and test their abilities to pull off the most stylish combos possible, and the result is a game that keeps a breakneck pace and never slows down. There isn’t a single dull moment in Devil May Cry 5, and it’s arguably the best game in the series to date.",,,,,,"Devil May Cry 5 is a fun new hack and slash entry in the series, but it doesn't deliver enough refreshment. This makes the action sometimes feel like you have been there before.

Every cutscene feels like it belongs in a movie, and every battle feels powerful and intense as each new ability is unlocked. The only fault the game has shown me is a drop in frame rate during a few cutscenes but is definitely nothing to be worried about.

Consider my Devil Trigger thoroughly pulled.",,"Aside from my story gripes with Lady and Trish and my couple of issues with the Devil Breaker, Devil May Cry 5 practically exceeded my expectations. As a fan of the series all the way back to day one, and especially a fan of Devil May Cry 4 and my man dude Nero, Devil May Cry 5 is not only an excellent character action game. It’s also a mostly satisfying end to the story. I’m sure there’s more Devil May Cry to be had from here, but the story that started all the way back 2001 finally feels like a complete work, and that’s a rare treat.",,"Devil May Cry 5 has a lot going on in almost every possible way. Some ideas such as gold orbs and linked missions feel undercooked, yet it's hard to describe the fighting as anything other than spectacular. The number of options within any single battle is nothing short of ridiculous. If most games are defined by having a bunch of ideas and then trimming them down to the best ones, it's almost as if DMC5 couldn't say no when it came to weapons or abilities while also taking the time to give each a strong purpose. Beyond the mechanics, what lingers even longer is that some of the encounters, especially toward the end, are exciting because you'll care about the events that led to them. Devil May Cry 5 has been a long time coming, but it feels like hitting the jackpot.","For everything Devil May Cry 5 does right, it does something wrong. The good graphics, the fantastic music and the new gameplay ideas are watered down by the weak, uninteresting story and its repetitive experience that will leave the fans with a mediocre experience.","As much as I can gripe about its flaws, it’s hard not to grin when you’re shoving a running motorcycle wheel into a demon’s face.

All the expected Deathmatch-ish modes are here, including War Pigeon, a take on Capture the Flag.

The campaign is mostly great, but again, probably no more than a 6-7 hour experience, and obviously not the worth the price of admission by itself. You will have to love multiplayer to make this game worth it, and if you don’t, well, you’re out of luck.",,,,,,,,,"Battlefield 1 has some new great features, for example the War Stories for the single-player and Operations for the multi. The gameplay is brilliant, but fast, and sometimes seems not so integrated with the atmosphere of the Great War. Despite of some minor technical problems on the multiplayer, the game is graphically marvelous and the soundrtrack is as well.",,,"Battlefield 1 isn’t just a great addition to the series, it arrives as a thunderous explosion that will impact the military shooter space for many years to come. A memorable single player campaign in an FPS is a rarity, and it delivers that without compromise.

The decision to create a mini-series following multiple soldiers is brilliant, and something that other games should follow in the future, as there wasn’t a single moment of filler. It’s just a shame that the word “mini” is so apt, with the whole campaign over all too soon. It’s testament to how good it is, though, that I simply want more of it – more stories, more acts of heroism, more incredible, heart-wrenching moments.",,,,,There is no game that is able to deliver such an immersive war atmosphere and a multiplayer experience on such a massive scale like Battlefield 1.,"Overall, I thought the whole game was very well done, balancing history, fun, and personalized stories set within epic battles. The game challenged my own preconceptions about World War I and taught me a few new things. I developed an appreciation for the diversity of the battles and the technological change from the beginning of the war to its end. Overall, I thought it did a wonderful job delivering something fresh. And that’s very hard to do in the shooter genre.","EA and DICE have done an amazing job bringing something fresh to the table in picking WW1 as the game's theme.

This time, Ubisoft hit a real Homer.","Assassin’s Creed Odyssey lives up to its namesake. By fully investing in becoming an action RPG, Odyssey’s characters, combat, story, and scope are beyond anything the series has accomplished so far. Its ambitions might get the better of it sometimes, like in how it divides its story moments or in how the leveling system can get out of hand, but the overall experience is, simply put, epic.

It’s a tougher game with a bit more strategic thinking required than the first, but remains a top-shelf shooter that is a must buy for any fan of the genre.","Titanfall 2 is a gigantic stompy robot that for whatever reason is slipping by gamers unnoticed. This is a travesty, as it's an incredible title – easily one of the best of the year.","Titanfall 2 has made good on its promise of a worthy single-player campaign. It is rather short, however, and this combined with the relative lack of variety and modular Titans in the multiplayer modes equals a low replay value.",,,,,,,,"Titanfall 2 goes for feel above all else, and it feels fantastic.","Titanfall 2 is everything you would expect from a sequel. Packed with more adrenaline, tons of action and new titans. The new multiplayer progression system is a major change along with the new campaign. Titanfall 2 feels like a step forward into the franchise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s a phenomenal multiplayer experience coupled with a surprisingly varied and downright exciting campaign. Respawn have improved on the original’s excellent multiplayer aspects, moved across to multiple formats and nailed the single-player experience, as a result Titanfall 2 is an absolute must buy.","As a sequel, Titanfall 2 is everything it was supposed to be. By extension, that means it isn’t a game changer; it isn’t as inventive or surprising as its predecessor, but then again, it couldn’t be. Titanfall changed the trajectory of the FPS in a powerful and immediate way, and that success isn’t to be simply re-created but iterated upon dutifully. Despite Respawn’s best efforts, the game’s obvious advancements and its spectacular engagement across multiplayer, Titanfall 2 doesn’t offer the same determined focus and balance that defined its predecessor.",,,,,"Respawn went all out with this sequel, patching up its biggest hole, tightening its loose screws, and delivering the game I think we all hoped for when we first caught wind of the original back at E3 2013.",,,"Titanfall 2 has a spectacular campaign and a multiplayer that has been redesigned to provide a better experience. Even with its problems, as a short campaign or old graphics, Titanfall 2 is one of those games that you have to play.",,"Titanfall 2 boasts the best FPS campaign since Modern Warfare, and it comes bundled with an exciting, hyper-fast multiplayer that will keep you entertained for months. This is proof that Respawn is still the best shooter developer in the business. Like a Pilot zipping along a vertical surface, I can only hope the developer maintains its impressive momentum.",,,"Titanfall 2 offers players an amazing campaign, but the multiplayer is very disappointing. This makes the game just average overall, which is a waste because it could have been so much better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Titanfall 2 is a near perfect example of what a quality developer can produce when it listens to the feedback of the community, as it delivers a stunning marriage of near perfect gameplay, near perfect multiplayer, and a story that is well...near perfect. I am very confident saying that Titanfall 2 is one of the best games you can play in 2016, period.",,,,,,"Titanfall 2 is a fun game. Even though it has a short campaign, I had a great time playing it. Multiplayer is fun thanks to the game’s amazing gameplay, but lack of balancing and awkward level design make it a forgettable experience. I can easily say that Titanfall 2 is a good game, but its lack of depth will ensure I won’t be visiting it again anytime soon.","Despite some balancing problems, Titanfall 2 is a great game, with a solid single player campaign and a lot of fun when it's time to go online.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Titanfall 2 builds on the promises of the first game in every way imaginable. Rewarding gameplay innovations remain intact, providing consistent thrills in both multiplayer matches and the campaign.

huntdown,,,,,,"Outside of some cheap boss battle tactics that arbitrarily crank the difficulty up, Huntdown is an excellent retro styled action game. The combat is fun, brutal and often funny, the visuals and audio are top notch and each stage is just short enough to keep us feeling like we’re moving along nicely.",,,,,,,,"Huntdown on Xbox One is a game with immense personality and presentation, featuring a 2D action campaign that is built around memorable boss encounters, and plenty of them too. With so many games out at the moment it’s easy to let things slip by, but don’t let Huntdown go under your radar, lest there’s a bounty on your head for doing so.",,,,,,"Some of Huntdown‘s boss battles might have elements that feel a little unfair, especially on higher difficulty levels, but it can’t be denied that it’s a great game with lots of character. It does a brilliant job of feeling like a blast from the past, yet the responsive controls and cover mechanics firmly plant it in the modern age. It’s the best of both worlds, basically, and if you’ve ever enjoyed mowing down legions of goons on a 2D plane while characters’ wisecracks compete against synthesised 80s beats for your attention, you’ll absolutely love it.",,"If classic run and gun games are something that piques the interest, Huntdown is a must buy. I am glad the amazing trailer was for a fantastic game. A throwback that doesn’t reinvent the wheel but works out some of the finer kinks of the genre.",,,,,,,,,,"Huntdown is a blistering and blood-soaked adventure that may look retro but feels remarkably modern. The title takes the basic formula of the sidescroller and tweaks it with notable improvements such as a cover system and boss battles that require more than just brawn. The genre may be flooded with similar romps, but Easy Trigger Games' effort stands out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A nice old-school user with low in longevity and high in challenge. Especially good if you play it side by side with a friend. Excellent pixel-art.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Innovative gameplay and incredible aesthetics make Huntdown a must play run and gun shooter.

destiny-2,"Whether chatterbox, lone wolf, newcomer, or old hand, Destiny 2 is unmissable. [Nov 2017, p.70]",,,,,,"Destiny 2 takes the groundwork set out by its predecessor and refines some of its rough edges, especially in terms of its plot. Bungie hasn't changed the fundamentals of the game but has made it feel a lot more accessible to new players. They've increasing the number of activities there are for players, although the grind does eventually set in. That said, it doesn't quite feel like a sequel. There isn't much in the way of brand new content — a lot of what has been added is the same as before but just repackaged in some way. The title does still have plenty of room to grow and if its life cycle is anything like that of the original Destiny, the game may look and feel different in two years time. With two expansions already on the horizon, we may even see a few changes in the very near future.",,"Destiny 2 rights many of the first game's wrongdoings and results in a stronger launch offering, with a finally compelling narrative experience and a more satisfying progression. What it lacks is greater variety in enemies and locations compared to the first game, so we're once again left hoping in future content.",,"Destiny 2 returns strongly. The confidence of ex-players will be hard to win with their DLCs policy and a gameplay system that is too similar to the previous one, despite significant improvements. However, it hides one of the best and more entertaining shooters you can find today. The level of addiction it creates in players is insane. The best new IP of this generation is consolidated.","If anything, Bungie has clearly refined upon the first Destiny, building upon what made the game so good, while avoiding some of its weaknesses. For those who enjoyed Destiny the first time around, Destiny 2 has so much to offer – even for returning players. But at its core, those who weren't fans of the original won't find major revelations in this sequel.",,"It is no exaggeration to say that the final mission of the game, one that takes over an hour to complete, has more story in it than the whole of the first game. Better writing, a story (and a good one at that) and a series of vast new worlds to explore make Destiny 2 a must play for anyone who like aliens, guns and shooting aliens with guns.",,,"Destiny 2 is a blast out of the gate thanks to its excellent co-op shooter gameplay and strong storytelling in the campaign. Not all the features I’d expected to find are here, but it does deliver the same kind of highly social gameplay and rewarding, loot-driven progression that helped the original keep me hooked for hundreds of hours. The main concerns right now are a few bugs and lack of event options, but I’ll definitely be sticking around to see this big, action-packed universe develop over time.",,,,,,"Destiny 2 is an overall improvement over the original with changes that make the game more rewarding, valuable of your time, and gameplay that anyone could get into.","Destiny 2 is more accessible to the neophytes than the first game was, but still complex enough to get long-time players to invest hundreds of hours in the universe. The story of the campaign is less confused than in the original, but it’s not exactly good either. It went from painstakingly bad to ordinary, which is at least an improvement. Destiny 2 is the gaming equivalent of a Michael Bay movie.",,"While the first Destiny had its shortcomings, they're not quite so evident here. Destiny 2 does everything that the release version of the original failed to do, with a worthwhile story and plenty of other activities to complete, right out of the box. A fantastically enjoyable and insanely addictive shooter, Destiny 2 is certainly well worth your time.",,,Success through strong teamwork is absolutely the best part of Destiny 2.,,,,,,,,"I was surprised by how much this new incarnation of Destiny appealed to me. New worlds are brilliantly designed, sound and visuals are top notch, combat feels great (those headshots!). This is how the first Destiny should have looked. [12/2017, p.50]",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Those who’ve been spurned by Destiny only to be won over by rich DLC will feel right at home in Destiny 2. Those who passed on the original title because of its weak launch will find this is a completely different experience, one with Halo‘s DNA interwoven through Destiny‘s addictive core gameplay. It’s definitely worth a try.",,"Those who tried playing Destiny but didn't stick with it should probably give Destiny 2 a try as it has addressed a number of issues that were present in the original game. Regular Destiny players will undoubtedly have their own personal list of complaints about the sequel, but none of them should be a deal-breaker and after an adjustment period of getting used to the changes they should find themselves playing Destiny 2 as much as they played the original. As for new players, Destiny 2 provides enough content through its campaign and related mission that you'll get more gameplay out of it than you will a standard shooter even if you don't continue playing much beyond the campaign. And after that, many of you will find yourself getting hooked on the drive to push for better gear so that you can take on the top challenges the game has to offer.","A great improvement over the first installment, but not a perfect game. Its history is good, but not great and its gameplay looks like an evolution of what we've already played.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's now good enough that you no longer need to make excuses about why you play so much Destiny. Destiny 2 may misstep in a couple of ways its predecessor didn't, but it also shores up its fundamentals so thoroughly that the future for Destiny fans looks bright indeed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bungie does it again with Destiny 2. The game will certainly please veteran players, but is also a good starting point for newcomers. Most of the changes made are positive ones, but unfortunately not all.","Destiny 2 has renewed my faith in Bungie, the series as a whole, and is easily what the first Destiny should've been as it fulfills on everything that it originally seemed it would be and more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Destiny 2 is all that the veterans of the original game could want. It‘s also a great entry point for the newcomers. An addictive gameplay returns with tens if not hundreds of hours of entertainment.

Featuring a stellar, albeit easy, single-player campaign, excellent combat and class mechanics, and the most enjoyable cooperative multiplayer I’ve seen in a shooter since Gears of War 4, Destiny 2 is a must-buy.","Destiny 2 is a very solid game that is so much better than the first, and with that being said, it will be interesting to see where the journey takes gamers from here.",,,,,,,,,,,"Just when you think you’ve run out of things to do in Destiny 2, the game teases you with an additional 5-10 hours of gameplay. What I’ve reviewed doesn’t even include the additions of Iron Banner, Faction Rally, or the hard mode for the Raid.

It is an essential purchase for anyone looking to expand their Forza Horizon 3 experience.",,,,,,,"It’s pretty much a nailed on cert that any past, present or future Forza Horizon 3 player will want to take to Blizzard Mountain as a matter of priority.

Packing treacherous icy roads and extreme blizzard conditions, this gorgeous-looking expansion is an awesome automotive winter wonderland.",,A great and frozen DLC that expands all the awesome concepts that we saw in the main game. A must have if you enjoyed Forza Horizon 3.,,,,,Forza Horizon 3: Blizzard Mountain is a DLC expressly dedicated to the players who appreciate extreme challenges. This extra content offers 8 new cars and 50 new tracks.,,"If there's a knock against Blizzard Mountain, it's that Forza Horizon 3 was already a robust package. Australia's bursting at the seams with all sorts of activities, and it'll take dozens of hours to complete them all. Blizzard Mountain's for those who are ready for more, because that's exactly what it is: More. The setting is just a nice novelty.

The only complaint that is worth noting is the fact that the progression system's change makes for some very hard work to get three stars, and although I get the fact that a challenge is good, it can still be on the hard side now and then. With a great new environment, solid visuals, eight new cars, and of course hours of new content to race and explore, this DLC is easily worth the price of admission.",,,,,,,"Albeit a little pricey, Blizzard Mountain offers a completely new scenario, covered in snow and ice. Astounding to watch, it also represents a prominent shift from the old arcade-y driving model to something more challenging and satisfying. The career progression is surprisingly deep, and even if the mere amount of new content isn't as overwhelming as the original game, you'll find yourself knee-deep in the snow for quite a while. With a frozen smile on your face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Blizzard Mountain expansion is a no-brainer for those who are already deep into Forza Horizon 3. Developer Playground Games has delivered a challenging experience that both broadens and compliments the world of Forza. Given that Blizzard Mountain can't be accessed until having played many hours into the game, however, those who are just starting or haven't reached the point at which it would unlock should wait and see first whether they get there and are still engaged with the game before buying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beautiful, colorful, well animated and accompanied by catchy music, the title of Tribute Games multiplies the nods to the franchise and will delight all those who despaired of rediscovering the sensations of yesteryear.

It’s clear that the developers spent a lot of time with the old games to help them create this nearly perfect recreation of old TMNT beat’em ups.

However, modern gamers who didn’t grow up with cartridges that needed a good blow and a bang might find the admittedly simple and one-direction gameplay a bit too basic.

When Clover was around, it strove for interesting and eclectic action games, like God Hand and Viewtiful Joe. The team lives on in the form of Platinum Games, but even now it is a developer that plays it much safer than it used to. As far as conversions go, Okami HD is solid. Some aspects should be better when considering today's standards for remasters, but when the core experience is still able to hold up for over 10 years, it's hard to complain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Okami HD is just as good now as it was when it launched in 2006, but now in beautiful 4K.

While it’s Xbox One port may lack some features available on other platforms—such as VR and portability—Thumper is still a fantastic and frightening game that's drenched in atmosphere and polished to the absolute max.,,,,"On the outside, Thumper looks bizarre with its strange design and nightmarish visuals. But don’t let that fool you, Thumper has it where it counts. Behind the game lies an incredibly deep rhythm game that invigorates the genre and will push and punish you in equal measure. Pair that with extremely quick load times and a game that flawlessly runs at a smooth 60fps, and Thumper will be music to your ears.",,,,,,,"Thumper thrives due to the way it marries speed, simple controls, and mesmerizing atmosphere.",,,,,,,,,,,,"On One it is as good as ever: a very challenging rhythm-experience, graced with minimalistic visuals and a steep, but fair learning curve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-witness,,,,,,,,"The Witness has an abundance of content, and even after 25+ hours I feel I have barely scratched the surface of the secrets the island holds for me.","An unique experience with mountains of puzzles to solve, a great look and an intangible mystery to discover, but lacking on the storytelling side and with a sometimes unbalanced difficulty progression.",,,,,,,,"The Witness has a power and pull that carried me throughout the more than 40 hours it took to complete it for the first time, and that, even now, beckons me back to confront the mysteries I left unsolved. Its graceful combination of tangible goals, obscurity, and freedom creates ample opportunity for small victories and grand revelations alike.",,,,,"The Witness is an example of superlative game design. Carefully crafted and mentally challenging. Everyone should dive into this world, it is the perfect game for several players to sit on a couch and solve. It will make your head hurt, it will tease your brain more than any game before it, but it also delivers satisfaction in solution better than anything else before, and perhaps after it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Xbox fans had to wait a while, but now they also can experience this challenging puzzle experience. It is less adventure but more intensive puzzle marathon with creative tasks sometimes connected over multiple tiers that lacks a coherent combination of puzzle solving and story-telling.",,,,,,"A colossal achievement in puzzle gaming, with a very cleverly conceived setting and story, but the lack of variety and reward becomes stifling.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Just a phenomenal title which stands up well on Xbox One. Despite its 30 FPS presentation which results in feeling like trudging through molasses, the game still features intelligent puzzles and rewards the player when they finally figure it out.",,"The Witness is undeniably self-indulgent; it’s too long, too single minded and occasionally, a little too abstract for its own good. It’s never more than the sum of its individual parts, but despite its issues, there is no escaping the fact that its individual parts are all universally fantastic. The puzzles are as compelling as they are plentiful, the art design is exemplary and the world itself a consistently compelling place to be. It lacks the magic that made Braid quite so special, but judged upon its own merits, The Witness is a worthy successor to Myst and one of the finest and most ambitious puzzle games of modern times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"They really don't make 'em like this any more. The Witness is an amazing game that you'll love to hate for its challenge, cursing it, wondering why you made the purchase, and then something will click for you, and it'll become one of the best games you've ever played.",,,,Beautiful and intelligent.

Completing this game will require the comprehensive ability to decipher keys which in turn will teach you solutions, and you will need to combine all of this together with the ability to adapt on the fly because every single puzzle is different. Would I pay $39.99 + tax for this game? Regrettably no. Sadly, the game does do a good job at giving you a lesson in isolationism, and while that is unique, the game itself doesn't feel like one flowing cohesive experience with any sort of point. If this game was priced at $24.99 or below though, it would be a must buy every day of the week, and twice on Sunday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is daunting for even hardcore racers. However, if you are seeking a real rally simulation experience and have strong willpower to overcome all the challenges that this game throws at you, it’s the best game on the market compared to titles like Sébastien Loeb Rally Evo and WRC 5.",,,"It’s the best rally racer on modern consoles, and a fine debut for this DiRT sub-series.",,,,"If you've got the time and patience to overcome its seemingly impenetrable exterior, then Dirt Rally is a thrilling racing game that's best in its class.

While I am indeed a fan (of marmite and Civ), I did feel slightly let down by the laggy performance and seemingly slower pace than I remember.

It's beautiful, and the functionalities, as well as the interface, are quick and easy to handle. The performances are close to those on PC, as long as you're not too demanding. The real problem lies mainly in long loading times, but you should not get them often. The extensions are sold separately and thus the price is too high, which is regrettable given the game was released 3 years ago. For those who don't have a decent PC, however, this is a good opportunity to get into this excellent title, or simply to discover the under-represented genre on consoles.

cuphead,,,"Every detail in Cuphead speaks of the love its creators have for perfectionism, from the beautiful visuals to the refined gameplay mechanics. The commitment of Studio MDHR goes beyond a tribute to classic 30s cartoons, it pays homage to the best platforming in videogames and feeds the hunger of those who pursue a genuine challenge.",,A crazy journey back in time with side-scrolling shooter mechanics thrown in for good measures. It's really one hell of a ride.,,"Cuphead is likely to reveal its deliberate frustrations too late for some people. It's hard not to become infatuated with the game's visuals, leaving uninformed buyers lured in by those blatant strengths to discover only then that it revels in its own relentlessness. This, in turn, could leave some wanting a refund and needing a new controller or two. However, for those that go into it with a co-op partner and with the knowledge that its design is as unforgiving as it is beautiful, it will be a unique and rewarding game. Always unabating but never unfair, Cuphead is tough to overcome but even tougher to put down.",,"A gorgeous and incredibly satisfying action-platformer, with awesome art and sound, flawless gameplay and a perfectly balanced difficulty. Definitely one of the best games of the year and an absolute must buy for any platform/shooter lover.","Cuphead is a challenge with an impressive technical section. Difficult and challenging, with very fluid mechanics.","Cuphead is the marvel we've been looking for. A tittle that surpasses all expectations, one of the best games of 2017, and definitely, the most beautiful. The wait has been worth it. Cuphead is here. And it's big. Really big. Deal with the devil.","Cuphead is a tremendous achievement that will probably go down as one of this year's most beautiful and creative titles. Each level, each song, and each boss character is a meticulously crafted work of art in its own right, that you won't soon forget. The gunplay mechanics might feel a little dated, paying homage to 8-bit shooters of yesteryear, but they're well executed overall, and come with some modern flair in the form of super attacks and other powerups.","The art is something the videogaming landscape has never seen before and is, arguably, worth the price of admission alone. But we come for the art, and stay for the challenge. And boy, does Cuphead have challenge in spades. If you’re used to modern gaming, this is going to take you to absolute breaking point and might even push you away, but if you grew up on the more arcade-centric 8 and 16-bit games of the past, and love the challenges those games served up, then Cuphead is absolutely for you. Art and design combine, but with the sole purpose of crushing you -- what’s not to love?","It is platforming greatness at its very best, and proves just what can be achieved when the necessary time is put into fine tuning a game before release.","For players that appreciate classic run-and-gun combat, punishing difficulty, constantly learning from failure, and breathtaking art, Cuphead’s experience will not disappoint.","A potent cocktail of authentic 1930s aesthetics, jazzy tunes, ingenious boss designs, and gameplay founded on the fundamentals inherent to the best 2D shooters. Cuphead sure is swell.","Cuphead made me feel more good and more bad than any other game I’ve played in the last several years. I swore, laughed, and hollered with delight. I hated it (and my own fingers) for long stretches but, having finished, I realise that’s more or less the point – I emerged from all that pain smiling. Rather than simply offering the player what they want, Cuphead makes them earn that right – the rewards, if you can hack the tests, are absolutely worth it. Cuphead is incredible for more than just its looks. But before you dive in, make sure you actually want a game that plays like this, and not just a game that looks like this.","The artists and animators, those working on the dastardly enemy AI or scripting, the musicians that contributed to this game should all take a bow. The wait was long and now it’s easy to see why, but Cuphead is most certainly a must play title in a year full of must play games.",[Recommended],"Cuphead isn’t so much of a case of style over substance, but rather style over accessibility. The art is simply astonishing, and so too the music, but the gameplay is frequently too frustrating to make Cuphead a totally enjoyable experience. Essentially a boss rush game, its pacing allows for no relief. There are no moments of downtime to come down from the frustration or elation of your battles, it’s just long bouts of tension and stress that, for the most part, outweigh any joy that’s felt.",,"Cuphead is a rare case where the long development cycle didn’t ruin the final product. This game matches its incredible look with stellar game play. In the sea of games releasing this year Cuphead stands tall as one of the best. There is little reason to skip this gem, it even comes with an outstanding value price and plenty of replay. Don’t sleep on Cuphead. Now if you’ll excuse me I need to listen to the soundtrack one more time.",,,"The animation alone is nearly worth the price of admission, but if you want imaginative bosses to fight as well, you're in luck with Cuphead. Just make sure you're prepared to die - a lot.","Cuphead is the kind of game that you only need to play for 10-minutes to realise the attention to detail Studio MDHR has poured into it. It looks incredible, sounds wonderful and is a pleasure to play… then the difficulty kicks in and it turns you into a quivering mess. It’s a game that can evoke frustration one minute and pure elation the next. Cuphead will go down as a classic, that's for sure, and it's quite possibly the hardest game I’ve ever played, but you just have to try it. If only for a short-while. Just get out before that blood pressure rises!",,"Cuphead's running and gunning is strong enough that it would have found an appreciative audience even with more video gamey art, but it's the perfectly executed 1930s animation style that makes it something special. From terrifyingly transforming beasts to the occasional fully-voiced character song, every element here makes it obvious Studio MDHR really knows and loves its source material.","Cuphead has been a longtime coming, and it's great to see that it lives up to its initial promises. It's beautiful to look at, and with a pitch-perfect soundtrack, it flawlessly captures the era its developers so clearly revere. It's also an intense action game that pulls no punches. It could benefit from a few tweaks, and two-player co-op doesn't feel like the valuable addition you might imagine, but Cuphead remains a rare, unique game that truly stands out.","There's definitely a point where it all becomes a bit too much, but Cuphead will best most games in how it looks and sounds, and defeating that boss that you once deemed unbeatable is glorious.",,"It may not be the deepest experience around, but in terms of pure gameplay quality, Cuphead is a must-play for those seeking a challenge thanks to excellent controls and a unique visual presentation.",,,,,,,,,"As a lifelong fan of classic cartoons Cuphead is a dream come true. The artdesign and its execution are out of this world. And while I can appreciate a steep learning curve and a decent challenge, the high concentration levels needed can get tedious at times.","Come for the gorgeous bygone ragtime jazz, Porkrind’s shop and an evil carrot; stay for the thrill of defeating a boss you’ve spent hours attempting. It’s painful, but you won’t find many games with such a moreish, satisfying sting.",,,"I wish I could recommend Cuphead to everyone purely on its amazing animation and the sheer amount of work that was obviously put into it, but I can't. The game behind the cartoony visage is finely tuned, well-rounded and (mostly) fair, but above all, it's incredibly hard. It starts off challenging and gets absolutely relentless by the final act. This is the kind of game that asks for a lot of patience and dedication from the player, but if you're into this type of challenge, you're in for an absolute blast.","Cuphead is a singular experience. Studio MDHR knew what it wanted to make, then went ahead and made it. A tough boss-rush game based on classic animation archetypes? It shouldn’t work, but here we are. It’s fun to play, and possibly even as satisfying to watch, since you can fully absorb what’s going on screen.","A stunning work of imagination, with a collection of high quality boss battles to rival any other in gaming – and a difficultly level that’s equally hard to beat.","Studio MDHR’s Cuphead is going to be one of those game you’ll either totally love or hate with a fury hotter than the fires of hell. This is a really, really hard game. One of its oddities is the inclusion of a Simple mode for bosses that make the battles significant easier except you cannot advance to the next world unless you've taken out their Regular forms. And because the Simple variants aren’t particularly helpful, there’s no reason they should exist. The platformer minded Run ‘n Gun stages are nice diversions but at their worst, you can tell they were added for wider appeal. As someone who absolutely love what Cuphead is, I learned to take these issues in stride. This is a game that made such a huge splash on arrival and has more personality and charm than anything launched this year.",,"Cuphead proves to be everything I wanted it to be — challenging, stylised and fun. It’s a tough, tough game — but unlike Dark Souls, my failures in Cuphead made me want to keep playing. Bring it on.",,,"Beautiful and difficult as hell, but as rewarding as you can imagine. Cuphead is one of the best indie games on 2017 and if you love run-n-gun games you should not miss it.","Cuphead is a stunning game. And a cruel one. You have to find out if it's more entertaining or frustrating, and that's not an easy task.","Cuphead is a game that not only has an audiovisual section with overflowing personality and unique appeal, but also a title with practically flawless gameplay and with challenging final bosses of the first order that give us some of the most intense, crazy and fun battles that we have played in recent years...It took some time, but it's been worth the wait. Cuphead is amazing from start to finish, and unless you hate shoot 'em ups, you have to play it. It's definitely one of the best games of the year.","You can already find videos on YouTube of people who have bested all of the game’s bosses in no-hit runs, but that’s like saying that you can find videos of someone running a mile in under 4 minutes and fifteen seconds.","Cuphead plays like something old and looks like something even older, but it’s more stylish than any shoot-’em-up or moralizing cartoon. Unfortunately, while the game looks phenomenal and is overflowing with personality, it doesn’t quite make up for one excessively frustrating mechanic and an unflinching level of difficulty.","Outside of a few nagging flaws, namely the frustrating run and gun levels, Cuphead represents the shoot 'em up genre at its absolute best. The boss battles are consistently exciting and just the right amount of challenging, while the 1930s cartoon visuals amaze in every regard.",,,,,,,,,"If you have any interest at all in platformers, 2D shooters or both, Cuphead is an absolute must-play. It is the pinnacle of the genre, and deserves to go down in history as an all-time classic.",,,"Cuphead is a brilliant homage to the run and gun genre as much as it is to the 30's cartoons. This retro experience is a though challenge that will reveal its true potential only to those brave enough to endure thousands of deaths by the minute. Cuphead is not accessible to everyone, and it is fine like this. Beautiful and diversified as any other, Cuphead is such a rewarding game; it reminds us the true taste of victory.",,"If you’re the type of person who derives joy from angrily banging your head into a boss over and over until you can perfectly defeat it in the most glorious 90 seconds you will ever experience, then Cuphead is the total package. The tight gameplay, accompanied by an incredibly well-realized aesthetic, makes for a truly unforgettable gameplay experience.","Cuphead has an amazing and incredible art style that's not only breathtaking, but also features gameplay that's going to test your skills. Even though some may find it beyond its skill's reach, if you're looking for a challenge this is exactly the game you should pick...The difficulty really lies (beyond the game mechanics) in the bosses, who usually add random elements that you just can never read, as well as the timing that you have to measure based on your mistakes. That is, in our view, what really makes Cuphead difficult.",,,"With some of the most breathtaking visuals of the year, Cuphead opened fire with graphics that seem made back in the 30s by Fleischer Studios itself, an OST of pure, swinging ragtime Jazz and gameplay so damn hard that we were in Heaven every time we have conquered a level. You definitely have to have some skills to play this game, to overcome its amazing Final Bosses, to pass through its impossible run & gun levels. But boy, what a feeling on the victory screen, and what a great game to begin October with. Studio MHDR, we salute you.","If you love those old-school games that rewards practice and patience through trial and error, Cuphead will likely delight. Yes, Cuphead is brutal and death is a regular occurrence, but it packs in that old-schoool arcade ethos that makes you want to keep trying.",Instant classic.,,,"Cuphead is an addictive mix of fun and frustration that will constantly keep you coming back for more. It’s amazing combination of terrific gameplay, tremendous style, and an original concept immediately catapults it into every game of the year discussion.","A staunch challenge for boss fight obsessives, but for many it'll simply be too frustrating. [Nov 2017, p.74]",,,,,"Microsoft's true standout exclusive for 2017. [Issue#194, p.70]",Cuphead offers a great deal of amazingly designed levels and bosses. You will have many days of fun and frustration: a combination that will make you love Cuphead till the bitter end.,,,"Cuphead ultimately leaves me at an impasse. I absolutely love the style of the game, and when the game works well it’s a truly rewarding experience that overcomes the seemingly impossible difficulty. Every time I beat a boss I felt re-energized, ready to tackle the next (and there are quite a few of them). But randomness and all too frequent bugs are rotten apples that spoil what could be a damn near perfect barrel of fruit.","Cuphead is a love letter to not just the decades-old cartoons it apes, but also gaming’s classic boss battles that have fallen to the wayside, as well. It’s far from easy, but don’t let that spook you out of playing this wonderful work of art. You’ll need patience and a steady hand, but you’ll absolutely be able to win out in the end.",Cuphead is a real tip of the hat to the 30's cartoons like Fleischer and Tex Avery offering a very good die & retry gameplay and it's awesome OST. A very good small game overall.,"Truly, Cuphead is a game which will give victorious gamers a sense of satisfaction that few modern games manage to accomplish. The nostalgic visual prowess supplied by the game’s hand-drawn animations are second to none, and its period-appropriate soundtrack will force its way into gamers’ heads. Precision gameplay is key here, and the mechanics behind it – aside of an improvable control scheme – deliver a delightfully challenging title that doesn’t hold your hand through the process.","An exquisite work of craftsmanship in almost every aspect. You will recover your faith in classic gameplay. Be careful, though, it's not a game for the impatient.",Cuphead ought to handily quash any lingering questions as to whether video games should be considered works of art.,,"Cuphead is a hardcore game with a beautiful art design that recalls the classic cartoons of the '30s. Based on splendid boss fights and with some ""run and gun"" levels, MDHR Studios' game is challenging and satisfying.","Cuphead is a tribute to the Technicolor cartoons of the 30’s. It’s a hard game as well, with old school mechanics that will bring you tears of frustration.","Cuphead is a must have for hardcore gamers who love cartoons. It looks like Popeye or Mickey Mouse from the '30s, but don’t let it fool you: the game is very hard. It's a pity that you can't finish the game on easy though, but still you should pick it up.",,,,"StudioMDHR transports players back into a 1930s cartoon with Cuphead, A stunning yet difficult title.","Cuphead impressed me in every facet, from its beautiful art style to its challenging gameplay. Studio MDHR clearly put a ton of love and time into every little detail in this game, and the entire package pays off that effort in a fantastic and challenging experience.",,,,"A stunning visual feast that belies an intense level of difficulty. Cuphead won't be for everyone, but it's still a very good game.","Going in, there was a real fear that Cuphead was going to be style over substance. You’ll likely feel the same as you punish yourself over and over through the first few stages. That feeling disappears once you start reading the enemies’ tells, and get a good understanding of when specials should be used. Eventually you come to understand what you’re about to partake in, and in the moments of quiet as the enemy gets knocked into its next phase, you’ll stare at the backgrounds, or the over the top animations, and you’ll wonder why a game like this hasn’t been made before. A good bullet-hell game doesn’t need amazing graphics to hook you into its gameplay, but it’s certainly nice to have one that makes every frame look gorgeously unique.",,,"Tough, but never unfair. The smart people at Studio MDHR have created a tremendously difficult yet genius game with a unique style that you have to see to believe.","Like so many classics of the 8-bit era before it, Cuphead extends its length via a brutal difficulty that will require hundreds of cumulative deaths for all but the preternaturally gifted.",,,,"The unique audiovisual elaborating and uncompromising playability beat a few freckles on the beauty of the game. Cuphead is a title that has mistakes, but you just cannot get it from the head. [Issue#279]",,"It’s almost needless to say that the visuals are incredible, creating a stunning run-and-gun boss battler that looks straight out of 1930s ‘toons. In fact, the presentation, the audio, the music and the general vibe are unbelievable. Cuphead will be too tough for some players, and you’d have to look to the likes of Nioh or Dark Souls to find something as brutal and unforgiving. It’s going to take some serious skill and experience to beat those bosses, but Cuphead keeps on bringing you back for more until you do.","Cuphead is going to be one of those games that many people recognize, even if they don't know its name or if they had played it or not, simply for its amazing artistic style; it’s that unique and should be applauded. It is one of those games that you can tell has been a labor of love, and by a very small team none the less, which makes it even more impressive. Stick with it and you’ll experience one of the most enjoyable titles in years, constantly challenging you but always a delight to play. I’m really hoping it does well, as I want a sequel one day, and hopefully by then I’ll have finally mastered Cuphead and bested every boss.",,,"Cuphead has had a long journey, and it’s great to see StudioMDHR’s efforts pay off. It does a superb job of capturing the essence of the early days of animation with fantastic art and a jazzy soundtrack. Its challenging difficulty provides some heart-pounding moments and an immense feeling of satisfaction once a boss is defeated. Although it suffers a bit in co-op and platforming levels, Cuphead is more than worthy of your time.","Cuphead is just the game for those who want a challenging Platformer. It may not bring anything groundbreaking to the table, but it's still a uniquely artistic and a memorable experience.",,,"Cuphead is a small, wonderful gem (albeit not a long one), with a truly unique art direction and a real challenging difficulty. It's not for everyone, but it will be an absolute joy for whomever is willing to take up the challenge.",,,,,,,,"The best part about Cuphead is that the challenge feels attainable. It's the right kind of frustration, the kind that makes a person feel like they can prevail if they just try one more time. It's easy for this type of game to feel cheap, but it never feels impossible. It's a gorgeous piece of work and a cup that feels better on repeated sips.",,,,,,"Although I speak very highly of Cuphead, I do think the game can be a little too unforgiving in enemy attack patterns and their ability to hit from offscreen without much warning. Regardless, the game’s tight controls, fun boss fights, and pleasing aesthetic make it a must have.",,,,,,The great visual style and the hectic gameplay makes Cuphead a game everyone should at least try.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Studio MDHR’s game is an arcane spell that raises Ub Iwerks and Max and Dave Fleischer from the dead to take over your screen with a psychotropic vengeance, right down to its glorious down-and-dirty ragtime score.",,"A brutal game that's equal parts frustrating and exhilarating, delivered in the mesmerising style of a prohibition-era cartoon.",Cuphead feels a bit like a good magic trick. The experience is brief and so artistically impressive that it’s hard to believe it’s happening before your eyes. The game has one of the most memorable art styles in years and turns every moment into a picture-perfect display of cartoon merriment. But this is more than just an eye-catching game. Cuphead is all about the big fights and the feeling you get from winning them. It’s delightful and fun and worth the effort it’ll take to clear.,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Cuphead experience is consistently wonderful. The nostalgic visuals, energetic soundtrack, and jubilant writing make this feel unlike anything you’ve played before.

That’s exceptional value for money, and with the writing and gameplay being so interesting and entertaining, it’s easy to get sucked in.",,"The Xbox One version seemed to perform decent enough, though there are times when smoke effects or other graphical elements kick into play that causes some system performance issues. Luckily, with the type of game this is, it was never a huge hindrance. Pillars of Eternity is a great RPG experience by Obsidian, and my time with the port was a very good experience. The excellent music and voice acting, the wonderful writing, and the multitude of ways quests can play out just add up to Pillars being a wonderful RPG to add to the collection.

Somehow the developer succeeds in the way the game is played on a controller.

DmC already had one of the most elegant combat-control schemes of any action game to date, but this Definitive Edition adds a lock-on system.

Addictive, with a more than respectable duration, which will depend on your ability or if you decide to play it in company, and at a price that admits no excuses. Guaranteed purchase.",,,The grind is real. The grind is great. Sky Force Reloaded is quite possibly the best arcade shmup money can buy.,,,,,,"It’s a game that I’ll return to time and time again, steadily upgrading my ship and attempting to master the fiendish later stages. The grind will be a problem for some, sure, but for most it will be a harmless hook that draws them into some brilliant vertically scrolling shooter gameplay, backed up with a solid soundtrack and eye-catching visuals. Sky Force Reloaded is indeed like a drug, but it’s one that provides high upon high.",,"I’ve always enjoyed the genre, and everything in Sky Force Reloaded is solid enough. From a visual, gameplay, and soundtrack standpoint, I’m more than happy. I just can’t shake this feeling that the game was designed to kill hours on the phone, and for me it just doesn’t translate into a great home console experience. I like replaying shooters like this, but I prefer to go through the entire campaign over and over again. Here I’m so burned out on each stage by the time I finish or unlock the next that I don’t want to play anymore, which is never a good sign. Though for the low price, there are much worse things to spend $9.99 on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sky Force Reloaded is everything that I wanted it to be and more. The replay value that every unique level offers up, as well as the four difficulty levels that each level has to offer assures there is always a challenge waiting to be tried and conquered. If you are looking for a game that keeps its overall design simple but still offers a fair challenge, Sky Force Reloaded may just be what you’re looking for!","Sky Force is a long-running series, but this is the first entry that truly hooked me and made me want to play more just to see how ridiculously overpowered my ship could become.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sky Force Reloaded never feels unfair, because when you die, you know it was your fault, prompting you to go back and grind some more stars for upgrades. While the grind is real and might turn some off, the reward for doing so is great. Prepare to sink many hours into this game if you want the pay off, but once you get there, it’s amazing. For a title that’s under $10 CAD, the amount of value within is outstanding. While it doesn’t surpass Ikaruga as my favorite shmup of all time, the fact that I had to think about it and compare it should speak volumes. I haven’t been this hooked and excited about a shmup in many years, and Sky Force Reloaded completely blew me away. If you’re a shmup fan at all, casual or hardcore, you need to have this one in your library without question.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Delivers what a sequel should be, with more of... everything... on top of the solid foundations they had with the predecessor.

It’s fun, damned fun, but the lack of single-player campaign, customization, and matchmaking options come as a bit of a surprise.","Titanfall was heralded as “the game” for Xbox One, which is a little unfair. It is a very niche audience that will dedicate themselves to the title. Also considering it is (eventually) coming to 360 and already out on PC, it is hardly exclusive.

However, in Titanfall's case, the failure to implement a strong narrative is ultimately inconsequential.

It's fast-paced but not schizophrenic, and many of its subtleties will require time and practice to come out in the open. On the other hand, this noteworthy step forward in gameplay depth should've been supported by a wider offering in terms of game modes, an aspect in which the game falls surprisingly short.","Despite its limited game modes and a multiplayer campaign that could have been better executed, Titanfall is one of the best online shooters you can find.","Titanfall has all of the pieces to make a very nice FPS puzzle -- a wide variety of well crafted maps, a decent amount of familiar game modes, and a prestige system to hold the interest of veterans. In that sense, it's a very welcoming game that many disenfranchised genre fans will enjoy. Just don't expect anything monumentally different, or a worthwhile world to enjoy while you're having fun shooting everything in sight.","Titanfall lives up to all the expectations established when it was first revealed, in a way that so few games are able ever to accomplish, and represents nothing short of first-person shooter multiplayer taken to new heights.","A spectacular and superbly crafted, if traditional, shooter.

It’s certainly not revolutionary, as some might have you believe, given that many of its ideas have been cribbed from other games and genres. What it is, though, is a consistently exciting, accessible and expertly crafted shooter that repeatedly generates highlight reel moments that make you want to keep coming back.","Titanfall is an excellent addition to the shooter market. It plays like a dream and the maps all feel like playgrounds. The contrast between playing as a pilot and a Titan is pleasant, and provides the necessary variety. It could’ve used more modes though.",,,,,"The main attraction in Titanfall remains the gameplay. On this side, there is no doubt that Respawn did a really great job. It's excellent, handy even with the profusion of possibilities. The parts of the game you play in Titans and you play on your feet are very well-balanced as well. However, it's difficult to hide the small number of modes and their lack of originality.",,,"Titanfall is perhaps the most accessible competitive multiplayer shooter ever, while still maintaining a fun competitive reward system for skilled players.",,An amazing title in terms of gameplay and fun.,,"It is hard to come up with original new IPs in a world of Call of Duty and Halo, but Titanfall really knows how to impress with their huge titans. You have to get used to the Xbox One controls, but the nice surroundings and fun multiplayer gameplay are definitely worth it.","If you want something more from your video games or if you want to be transported to another dimension to learn the true role of an intergalactic soldier, you should probably hit the books. If Titanfall is representative of man’s aspirations, we’re going no where fast.",,,,"As for the audio, it complements the game’s visuals. From the sound of each weapon (pilot or Titan), the minions chattering on the battlefield, to the sound of distant battles across the level or Titans exploding, it’s pretty awesome.","Aside from a few minor quibbles (I can jump across streets and hop over entire buildings, but a knee-high window ledge is insanely finicky to get past?) Titanfall is undoubtedly a great game which does an exceptional job of breathing new life into an increasingly-stale genre.",A bright and bold take on the popular multiplayer shooter format.,,"When you’re in the thick of the action, Titanfall is like no other shooter. It succeeds in making you feel like a superhero, piloting a giant mech to destroy your enemies with ferocious aggression. The fact there’s no option for private matches is an odd one, and there’s not a huge amount of guns on offer, really, but it’s arguably unfair to come down too hard on a developer choosing to focus on gameplay innovation over peripheral issues.","Titanfall is just so full of things. The world is beautiful and detailed, the maps are detailed and confusing, the giant robots have plenty of places to hide. Take your time to drink it all in as the bullets zing around and into you.",,,"It’s pretty incredible how much fun Titanfall is, and how fresh it feels, because the shooter hardly introduces new elements and mostly scouts mapped terrain. Respawn Entertainment manages to combine depth and fun seamlessly. That said, Titanfall is one of the most important players in the shooter landscape. Just like that. Boom, headshot.",,,,,,,,,The most fun I’ve had with a multiplayer FPS in a long time.,,,,"For a multiplayer-only game, Titanfall should have some amazing options and ways to play. But it doesn’t. It has a very healthy number of maps (15), but the lack of interesting new modes will make you feel shortchanged for not getting a single-player campaign. Hell, even shooters like Halo 2 from two console generations ago offer more in the multiplayer-options department...But what is there is so incredible.",,,,,,,,,,"Even with the usual launch jitters, Respawn has reinvigorated the multiplayer experience by incorporating campaign elements, and focusing on fun. While the long-term enjoyment of competitive play will be tested over the coming months, Titanfall establishes a solid base--one that should be rewarding for those who invest in the game for a prolonged period of time. This is no ""flash in the pan,"" and we're eager for more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In its current form, then, Titanfall is perhaps more of a step forward for shooters than a giant leap. But that still represents the most positive momentum seen in the genre for at least five years. Quite simply, if you feel like you're in danger of falling out of love with multiplayer shooters, Titanfall is the game to win you back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It doesn’t redefine first-person genre, but it certainly threatens the status quo, and that’s a welcome step forward.",,"No, this game is far from the ""revolution"" that excited critics have eagerly claimed it to be, but it is a wonderful little example of how fresh a standard shooter can feel when you pour all sorts of extra garnish over a solid foundation.",,,,,,,"Titanfall is a wonderfully fast, open, and instantly accessible 12-player shooter, and if playing online is at all important to you, it’s an essential addition to your Xbox One library.","Titanfall isn't tuned to perfection for everyone yet, but it starts as a smart, swift and startling movement in well-traveled space.","Titanfall succeeds in reinterpreting the FPS genre introducing fresh ideas alongside the old ones, being what we'd call a plug&play game with a great future.","This sweaty, intertwined combat threesome – Pilots versus Pilots, Pilots versus Titans and Titans versus Titans – gives Titanfall a unique energy and fluidity that I’ve never seen in a shooter before.","What matters is what Titanfall is. And that is an expertly formed shooter. It lacks many built-in charms gamers might expect, like obvious eSports functions and game modes that really promote how this experience is truly different. But it’s also clear that this is stage one of an ongoing process.","Titanfall is an accessible, well-balanced and intensely enjoyable multiplayer first-person shooter that successfully delivers on the concept of blending human and mech combat.","An immensely enjoyable and exquisitely crafted shoot-em-up...Yet Titanfall is also a worrisome product that delivers only a fraction of what competing games – including Call of Duty – do, for the same price tag. That sets a worrying precedent where gamers are set to get less game for the same money. As the next generation of consoles takes root, this is both a commercial and an artistic concern.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

resident-evil-7-biohazard,"A leaner, meaner breed of Resi that, despite flaws, puts the series back on track...Resi VII has carved itself a seedy, resolutely icky place in our cold, blackened hearts. [March 2017, p.73]",,,,,,,,"Despite its radical switch to first person view, Resident Evil 7 biohazard represents a real comeback to the series' origins, with a disturbing and scary atmosphere, great story and characters and a thrilling gameplay mixing exploration, puzzle solving and combat. An awesome new beginning for Capcom's franchise.","Resident Evil 7 is one of the best survival horror games of recent years. The Bakers are terrifying, the first-person camera works fine and the atmosphere is unique. But, the most important thing is that Resident Evil 7 is the best title in the saga since Resident Evil 4.","Resident Evil 7 seems to us an indispensable game if you like the adventures with action and puzzles, but with a great inconvenience: IT IS SO SCARY. Keeps you heartbroken for hours and that is everything that we wanted from this title. Stay away from the prejudices you had about this game of the Resident Evil saga, because you will love it without a doubt.","I loved exploring the dilapidated swamps of the Baker Plantation, exploring each macabre room, perusing each foreboding text file, and desperately diving through each fetid trash can for discarded shotgun shells. The Baker family are brimming with depraved personality and beat out some of the franchise's most staple characters for their demented, violent behavior. Some of RE7's most horrific moments will be burned onto your mind and may take weeks to subside.",,"The changes have been a long time coming, but the final result may well have given us one of the best horror titles we are likely to see this year…finally bringing the horror back to Resident Evil.",,,"Resident Evil 7 grounds itself in elements that made the original great while still indulging in a risky new shift in style that both helps and hurts the beloved formula in equal measure. But it’s also the closest a numbered sequel has come to recapturing Resident Evil’s slow, but thrilling and atmospheric adventure game roots in a while — a welcome return that I truly hope to see more of in the future.",,,,"Resident Evil 7 feels as terrifying as it does modern, all while returning the series to its roots.

Building upon what makes Capcom's survival horror so special, while effectively telling an entirely new story, Resident Evil 7 is a fantastic game that ought to please those looking for scares and fervent Resident Evil faithful alike.",,"From the swampy bayou location to the more intimate brand of horror on display, RE7 is the result of some unexpectedly excellent creative decisions for a series that has long suffered from identity crisis. It's a polished, confident horror game, and I can't wait to see more.","Unfortunately, the Xbox One version of the game can't quite live up to the looks of the others. In contrast to the PC and PS4 versions, colors look washed out and muddy, while textures seem almost blurry. Certain details like hair look significantly less natural compared to other platforms, and one early moment involving a chainsaw and a window looks more like an object accidentally clipping through the geometry than a weapon intentionally slicing through solid material.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,If you're a fan of RE games then be sure to pick up RE7 since it has a feel that suits both old and newer fans of the series. It has the survival horror of the older games and the intensity of the newer games combined into a new first person style of gameplay. The survival feel doesn't get out of hand to where it feels overwhelming and the intense feel doesn't get too heavy on the action - it's just a nice blend of the two. RE7 provides a truly refreshing feel for RE and one that I hope Capcom sticks with for future games in the main series.,,,,,,,"Resident Evil 7 is not only one of the greatest and scariest modern survival horror games in recent memory, but a fantastic return to form for one of Capcom’s greatest series.

I won’t spoil anything, but I will say that it’s not just a familiar horror story that we’ve seen in plenty of films and games over the years.

This may be the very best Dragon Ball fighting game to date because it captures, aesthetically and mechanically, the core and most enjoyable aspects of the series that fans have enjoyed for decades.","Even though I’m not the greatest at fighting games (and usually even despise playing them), Dragon Ball FighterZ manages to make the game feel easy to get into, and quickly become rewarding by learning move sets and counter plays. While the story mode allows a bit of the customization that was found in Xenoverse, FighterZ is much more focused on being a balanced fighting game rather than an RPG, and it’s all the better for it.",,"Dragon Ball FighterZ is an outstanding game, and for fans, it doesn’t get much better than this. The excellent and highly detailed visuals sit perfectly with the diverse combo-heavy gameplay mechanics, with cleverly implemented nods to the show throughout.

If you love fighting games at all, be sure to check it out. It's going to be awesome to see how this game grows in content as the DLC characters are released and improvement is made on the fighting game engine and existing characters.

Nevertheless, this is a game suited only for those who never played the original one: the revamped graphics aren't enough to justify the admittance price if you already played it.",,,,"The game on both PS4 and Xbox One is gorgeous, though it appears the PS4 comes out ahead in a few areas, such as all cut-scenes being rendered at 1080p, while some on Xbox One are capped at 900p.",,,,"The upstep in visual detail from the older console versions is a nice bonus, but Tomb Raider didn’t need massaging. It’s the same well-realised action reboot for Lara Croft that came as such a pleasant surprise last year.",,,,,,,,,,,,The exquisite visual design is so breathtaking that I continually found myself staring at the scenery instead of pushing onward. Tomb Raider is a great reinvention of this enduring franchise that made me eager to see where Lara goes in her future.,,,,,,"The only thing we can definitively say is that if publishers are going to begin overcharging for slight next-gen upgrades, then this is going to be one hell of a long generation.","If you never had the chance to experience the game a year ago, then the Definitive Edition is an absolute no-brainer. In fact, we’re even slightly envious of those people that waited, because Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition is one of the Xbox One's best games.",,,,,,,,,,"The biggest draw of Tomb Raider: The Definitive Edition is the improved graphics. They're simply stunning in perhaps the best-looking console game I've ever seen.

Even so, it's a great game made greater, so for those yet to play it, this is the version to get.",,,"A lack of decent bonuses makes the Definitive Edition a hard sell for existing fans, but for newcomers it's a slice of platforming perfection that will make the wait for next-gen blockbusters easier to bear.",,,,"This is the reboot we were waiting for.

rise-of-the-tomb-raider,"Not quite the evolutionary leap we’d hoped for, but this beautiful and bombastic adventure remains one of the most purely entertaining things you can put in your Xbox One this Christmas.",,"If it isn't broken, don't fix it was the mantra behind Rise of the Tomb Raider's development: they took the formula from the last game, they added new elements to it and polished some of the mistakes. Sadly, though, the game is far from perfect. However, we are happy to know that the saga is in good hands... Welcome back Miss Croft!",,Rise of the Tomb Raider is a brilliant game on the XBox One but it’s familiarity with the previous game prevents it from being its natural successor.,,"By far the biggest positive in RotTR is the platforming. This is an Action-Adventure title that leverages the Adventure over the Action. Crystal Dynamics has done a marvelous job constructing a veritable gymnasium of platforming pleasures for Lara to climb, swing, and jump through.","Rise of the Tomb Raider is a blast to play. This sequel blends together combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving better than its predecessor, balancing all of these elements and stretching them out in a way that makes the pacing feel spot on.","Rise of the Tomb Raider successfully builds upon the already good previous episode, delivering a rock-solid experience with a compelling story, gorgeous visuals and an open world packed full of things to do. Our only complaint is about the still too simplistic puzzles, but it's definitely a game every lover of this genre should look forward to playing.",,,,"The story takes bigger risks, and is all the better for it. By no means is it perfect, but the negatives are so slight they don’t really warrant full disclosure. This is a bigger, meatier sequel, one that improves on an already great game. And again, it gets the balance right. The balance between survival, in terms of facing off against an army of foes as well as giant killer snow bears, and exploration, in the form of archaeology-by-the-way-of Lara being genuinely excited when she comes across an ancient trinket or mural. And story.",,,"While essentially a retread of its predecessor, Rise of the Tomb Raider is a magnificent adventure game, brilliantly combining action genres and letting you play the way you want to.","Rise of the Tomb Raider raises the bar set by Lara’s last outing with a rollicking adventure story, strong villains, gorgeous vistas, and smart puzzles – go off the main path to find the best stuff in dastardly optional tombs. Though the mandatory combat doesn’t distinguish itself with challenging enemies unless you crank up the difficulty, Lara’s newfound versatility on the battlefield makes fighting a lot more fun.","Behind the depth of Lara's character and a compelling and emotionally charged story, the series is at its best in Rise of the Tomb Raider.","Rise of the Tomb Raider is a pretty good adventure game that stays close to its prequel instead of innovating. The new extra modes are a welcomed addition but for the next, final chapter of the trilogy, we would like to see some new features in the gameplay. Buy it if you own an Xbox One or you’re just looking for a great action game.",,"In that rubble, a wonderful bounty is excavated; an exquisite story, a compelling heroine, a fascinating sandbox, and a beautiful view. Rise of the Tomb Raider is a little more subdued, a little less bombastic, and a whole lot more introspective. It sometimes falters in scripted sequences and technical hitches. But the way it combines such excellent themes into such fantastic gameplay is evidence that Lara’s story was one that needed to continue.","Rise of the Tomb Raider is a stellar title for the fall season, and a sequel that addresses most of the complaints about its predecessor. Crystal Dynamics is really knocking it out of the park with the reboot of Lara Croft and I cannot wait to see how it evolves over time. Anyone with an Xbox One needs to pick this title up. It once again makes a solid case for my top ten list of games of the year.","While 2013’s Tomb Raider reboot was great, fans of the series were pining for more tombs to explore and relics to collect. Crystal Dynamics addressed that and then some in Rise of the Tomb Raider, improving on its upgrade system, telling a fun story, more puzzles, and adding bears, tigers, cheetahs, and more packs of wolves to kill and skin. Just like we remember.",,,"Rise of the Tomb Raider is a strong sequel to 2013's reboot, building upon the potential of its predecessor while adding to the sense of wonder and exploration-based aspects more in keeping with Ms. Croft's roots. Of course, more tombs and puzzles to solve would always be welcome, but Rise is nonetheless a fantastic blend of entertaining combat encounters, traversal and open-world exploration, and arguably a cut above the previous game in gameplay terms, if not necessarily in story terms.",,,"As a third-person adventure game, Rise of the Tomb Raider excels. Rather than collide, gameplay and story share the space, supplementing each other and emerging as a cohesive whole.","In an era when triple-A blockbuster games often drown beneath a desire to make things more explosive or complex than before, Rise of the Tomb Raider shows how it should be done. This is captivating romp that should cement Lara as a modern gaming icon.",,,"One of the finest — if not the finest — games of 2015. The Rise of the Tomb Raider doesn’t quite rise to the heights of its magical predecessor, but it builds on 2013’s Tomb Raider in every way, delivering a game that’s as much a video game as it is work of cinematic art — and setting a high bar for adventurers of the future (remember that, Uncharted 4).","In many ways, Rise of the Tomb Raider could be viewed as a fairly modest sequel. It successfully builds off Crystal Dynamics' excellent reboot, but it doesn't introduce any massive changes; the scope is greater but still in spitting distance of the previous game. But successfully regaining the feeling created in an extremely good game is no small feat.","One of the standout games of the generation so far, Rise provides stunning setpieces, brilliant exploration and challenging puzzles. This is an Xbox One essential.","The switch to a style of play that doesn't rely solely on raw firepower is the absolute key to the game's success and that, mixed with a plethora of action-packed adrenaline-boosting scenes, makes Lara's second return an absolute blast to play.","It’s basically the same great game we’ve played before but prettier and even more enjoyable. Actually the Tomb Raider series never offered so much fun. [13/2015, p.32]","Rise of the Tomb Raider isn't setting a tremendous new bar for all of action video games to follow, as much of this game stems from things we've done before, but it's still a neat little adventure buried in the God-forsaken wilderness.",,"Rise of the Tomb Raider is exactly what the very title promises. Lara feels more grown-up and she finally returns to the key element of the whole series – tombs. In all respects, her new adventure is better than the previous episode, and it is obvious that Crystal Dynamics went in the right direction.",Rise of the Tomb Raider still clings a little too tightly to certain elements of its predecessor and has problems with enemy AI. Nonetheless with the renewed focus on actual tomb raiding and exploration Lara slowly returns to her older grand self.,"A crowd-pleasing game, which offers only glimpses of what could be if this team were only allowed to take some braver risks with Croft’s next expedition.","I was expecting a solid game, one that just gave me more of the same as a follow up to the 2013 release. Yet what we got was a game that improved on the good and cleared away much of the bad, to produce a title that deserves its place among the best Lara Croft games over the previous 20 years.","While there has been an influx of open world games over the last few years, Crystal Dynamics have been able to find a perfect balance of cinematic action and strong adventure elements...Rise of the Tomb Raider is an adventure like no other, giving players a twenty hour experience that will have them engaged from the moment Lara comes on screen.",,"Rise of the Tomb Raider captures the thrill of being an adventurer and leaves you thinking about Lara's next move. You have daredevil sequences, heroic moments, fun exploration, and exciting fights that even Indiana Jones would envy. If Crystal Dynamics keeps raising the bar from here, I can't wait to see what's next for Lara.","The old style Tomb Raider is never coming back, but this is a more satisfying compromise than the reboot and a fun alternative to the Uncharted series.","Rise of the Tomb Raider is all about its pacing. It’s a game that will throw you into a huge action sequence and then slowly ramp back up. You don’t have to worry about endless waves of enemies. Instead you will move from one area to the next, traversing the world, hunting so you can craft and upgrade, and scouring the world for treasure and tombs. Crystal Dynamics took what worked in Tomb Raider and made it even better. Rise of the Tomb Raider is one of the best games of the year. It’s absolutely beautiful and plays as good as any game on the market today.",,,,"Overall, Rise of the Tomb Raider is easy to recommend. The gameplay is compelling and the tombs are a joy to explore, but Lara herself is the star of the show.","Maybe the best action-adventure of 2015, and the best looking game on Xbox One. Lara is back, and it's better than ever.","Lara faces her greatest adventure yet. It's a compelling and interesting journey, just a bit too close to the 2013 reboot in terms of pure gameplay. But a joy to play and explore nonetheless.",Rise of the Tomb Raider takes what we loved about the franchise's reboot and makes it bigger and better. A great combination of gameplay elements that you shouldn't miss if you enjoyed the previous Tomb Raider.,,"Rise Of The Tomb Raider understands what’s fun about being Lara Croft. It’s not blowing away an army of underlings with an assortment of guns, something that straight-up shooters do better and with more commitment to variety. It’s also not some bold new innovation in how to make a character run and jump, or unexpected deviation from a storyline. No, what’s always been the key to Tomb Raider is the thrill of discovery.","With Rise of the Tomb Raider, Crystal Dynamics has created a polished and impressive sequel to one of the best reboots I've ever played. It can become overwhelming at times, but that doesn't keep it from being a great and must-play release.",A great experience that is let down by its voice acting and certain key junctures in the story when the developers just tell us so much that we can guess what's going to happen next. The good news is that these are few and far between and the spectacular final missions make up for everything.,,"Not many sequels can improve on every aspect of the original, but Rise of the Tomb Raider is a rare exception.","This is easily the best 3D action game on the Xbox One, and hopefully it isn’t swept under the rug sales-wise in a crowded holiday season.",Rise of the Tomb Raider is a big-budget title that delivers a breathtaking adventure with all the trimmings.,,"The main game itself is easily worth the price of admission. A gripping story in spite of its cliches, with an expanded serving of the gameplay that made Tomb Raider such a wild ride, Rise of the Tomb Raider is a damn fine sequel that does everything a sequel needs to do. What’s more, it truly cements Lara’s new adventures as a series with a solid future, and I’m excited to see where Croft and Trinity go next.","And that's Rise of the Tomb Raider in a nutshell. The parts that weren't so great about the reboot are better, while the best bits are bigger, louder and more plentiful.","These breaks in linear action are wonderfully judged, allowing you to take a breath, find hidden treasure and help tribespeople by hunting down some wild boar or disrupting Trinity communication towers. There’s perhaps nothing here that you won’t have seen in open-world games, but these alluring pockets of freedom breaking out from a cinematic thrill-ride is a clever change of pace.",,One of the best things I played all year.,"Rise of the Tomb Raider will not be as memorable as the first reboot because it's doing quite the same things without taking risks, but it's still a really great game.","In a way, Rise of the Tomb Raider lives up to its name: You can see the classic Tomb There's far too much predictable, uninspired gunplay, but despite its mandatory nature it still comprises only a tiny portion of the overall game experience.","Nothing about Rise of the Tomb Raider is wildly original, but everything about it is executed with a high degree of quality and craft. The game nicely merges multiple styles of gameplay, tells a better story than the 2013 reboot, and leaves off with Lara Croft at the center of an expanding narrative universe that feels like it could become home to many more exciting adventures. The last game was a decent start, but for my money, this is where the new Tomb Raider really begins.","The last Lara Croft adventure comes with basic adjustments to its gameplay that make it an enjoyable and memorable experience. We loved the tombs, we loved the puzzles, we loved the exploration, we loved the world, we loved the combat. Even though not everything is completely perfect in Rise of The Tomb Raider, it’s a step in the right direction for the franchise.",Rise of the Tomb Raider is a whole level above its predecessor. Almost every aspect of the game is executed better than it did in TR so what we have is the definition of a worthy sequel that establishes the revamped TR as a new gaming chapter in the industry. The only setback is the highly extreme enemy A.I. which leads to a havoc-like situations amidst several gunfights.,"Lara has matured a bit from the first title in this rebooted series, but she's still the character we remember from the island. There's a renewed focus on utilizing stealth and surroundings in order to succeed to the best of your ability and plenty of side missions and extra tombs to raise the difficulty bar. Some A.I. issues bring the game down a bit at random times, but it doesn't change the fact that this game is quite deep and provides just as fun of a challenge as Tomb Raider.","Rise of the Tomb Raider is a great adventure game. More exploration, platform zones and stealth mechanics than shooter moments, and a great plot and loads of content to discover.","Crystal Dynamics have effortlessly done the impossible with Rise of the Tomb Raider, crafting a sequel that is superior to their reboot in every single way possible. It’s a bigger, more expansive experience that has a captivating narrative, engrossing gameplay loops and an absolutely stunning presentation. Rise of the Tomb Raider is one of the best action games ever crafted, and a generational leap forward as the series looks towards the horizon. Lara Croft is in good hands.","The biggest regret comes from the narrative side, where this sequel starts quickly and loses momentum once it reaches the halfway point. On the other hand, when you look at the gameplay and enhanced free roaming, what you get is a general overhaul of what made the original reboot a solid action adventure, bestowed with over-the-top graphics.","Rise of the Tomb Raider is full of action, adventure, emotions, and a sense of journey. All things we experienced in the previous game, but each is improved. Lara Croft and Crystal Dynamics have made a discovery: their own maturity.","Rise of the Tomb Raider is better than its predecessor, but only because of its additions; it doesn't fix any of the things that were wrong with Tomb Raider (2013). The story is smoothed down, much of it hidden away in dull audio logs. It's not about ""survival"" as billed, given the ease of mowing down dozens of folks and plenty of resources. But finding tombs wherein to clamber about ancient Rube Goldberg machines, coupled with the gorgeous visual flair and diverse environments, make Rise's wilderness one worth exploring and elevate Tomb Raider's otherwise perfunctory take on the third-person action platformer.","Whether you’re in the mood for stealth or all-out action, Rise of the Tomb Raider has got you covered, but when it comes time to put down the guns and start talking, the game screeches to a halt. Even so, it’s hard to deny what a blast it is to slip into Lara’s shoes once more.","Lara's rebooted renaissance continues in this gorgeous action epic - despite a rubbish story. [Christmas 2015, p.70]","The initial adventure in Rise of the Tomb Raider is around 6-8 hours, but every minute of it is fun, especially with retooled gameplay controls and unlockables for incentive. Adding to that time frame is a large amount of worthwhile exploring and wonderful backtracking once the campaign is completed. If you’re into that, then this game is going to make you happy.","As an adventure game, Rise of the Tomb Raider is up there with the best of them. The story feels like something right out of Indiana Jones, and the game nails the atmosphere that you'd expect from a Tomb Raider game.","This is a gentle refinement, ironing out kinks, sewing on a few accouterments, and leaving everything else the way it was. [Christmas 2015, p.110]",As a package Rise of the Tomb Raider is sublime pure Hollywood blockbuster entertainment with the only real negative that some could level is that the minute to minute gameplay presents very little that would be considered groundbreaking or new and at times it might feel similar to the previous iteration.,"It is an enjoyable game, but if only Crystal Dynamics could have resolved its conflicts by focusing its attention on what Tomb Raider does best and cutting out anything that got in the way of that, it could have been something far more special.","Rise of the Tomb Raider is most impressive in its action-packed scenes, but also trying to figure out puzzles in the many tombs are fun. You and Lara embark on a true adventure together, it is too bad this adventure is not told in the best storytelling out there.","The gameplay is the star here. Rise of The Tomb Raider does everything Tomb Raider did and does it better, taking a still-growing heroine into an unfamiliar location and unfolding its lethal mysteries as we grow to meet them. This is still not the game it could be, but it’s remarkable how quickly Crystal Dynamics has taken a half-dead franchise and turned into one of the most vital experiences on the market today, true to its essential character while still feeling absolutely new. This is the new standard for third-person shooter/adventure games. I want another.","Rise of the Tomb Raider is an action-packed tour-de-force that, while derivative at times, is a fantastic romp from beginning to end. This sequel learns some of the lessons of its predecessor by making the game more like a recognisable Tomb Raider game, while at the same time implementing some new features and impressive visual design. While not quite the globetrotting adventure some were hoping for, Rise of the Tomb Raider is well worth playing.",Rise of the Tomb Raider is a deeper and more polished version of its predecessor. It offers similar action-adventure thrills as its competition such as Uncharted but goes beyond that as well.,"Rise of the Tomb Raider’s only real flaw is that it follows the template of the first game a tad too cautiously, right down to the tough-to-kill supernatural foes that populate its final act. It also completely jettisons the notion that Lara is reluctant to take human life, a decision that makes for grittier action at the cost of some heart and soul. But as only the second installment in Lara Croft’s reinvigorated career, there’s still plenty of time to explore new territory. The tomb raider has risen. Let’s see where she goes next.","Despite almost no genuinely new stuff in the game, and a easy-to-guess scenario, Rise of The Tomb Raider is one of the best games of the year thanks to an impeccable technical aspect and very good gameplay which alternates between action, exploration, climbing and a lot of loot.","Crystal Dynamics has put together one of the most riveting action/adventure titles of this generation. Even then, Rise of the Tomb Raider is a game that people will play, love, and be done with, and that’s okay. It’s said to take dedicated completionists over 30 hours of playing to gather all of the hidden treasures, survival caches, golden coins, and weapon parts, which makes for a solid bang for consumers’ hard-earned bucks. Plus, who doesn’t want to fight a bear?","Crystal Dynamics makes a safe bet with a game that, even with his lack of evolution and difficulty, will make you feel like an adventurer exploring the unknown. We can't wait to know what the future holds for Ms. Croft.",There are few video game adventures that are as good as this one.,,"Crystal Dynamics listened and proceeded to make a game that softens the problems its predecessor had. It’s a satisfying adventure with plenty of content, some spectacular sequences and survival elements that fit a bit more in the mix. Unfortunately, while being very good, it’s not a masterpiece due to some not-so-great shooting, some technical bugs, and a narrative that, while making more sense than that of its predecessor, still has some weak and ridiculous moments. We do understand that action sells, but dampening it a bit to recapture some of the spirit of the originals would have been a great idea.",,"Rise of the Tomb Raider combines traditional Tomb Raider gameplay with some spectacular action. The AI is good and the game looks great. Yet you still get the feeling of 'been here, done that' whilst playing the game. It's an enjoyable game nonetheless.","The past decade has seen the genre jump, shoot, and blow stuff up real good with games like Resident Evil 4, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, and Dead Space. Each redefined what a well-balanced 15-hour experience could be by delivering a compelling narrative, tight gameplay, and outstanding world building. Rise of the Tomb Raider bests even those classics with a character that resonates like no other. Even if it took nearly twenty years for that to happen, this is an adventure worth replaying with a hero who’s unforgettable.","Lara’s therapy was a failure. Rise of the Tomb Raider was not, but it did force me to reconcile the uncomfortable paradox of the titular badass also being an emotional wreck.","Lara is back. Rise of the Tomb Raider has everything a Tomb Raider needs: impressive tombs, fantastic fights and a strong main character.","It goes without saying, of course, that Rise is an exceptionally gorgeous looking game.","Rise of the Tomb Raider isn’t the biggest open world game. It doesn’t have the most quests or the most collectibles, and heck, you don’t even climb tall structures without a darn good reason. What Rise of the Tomb Raider has in spades is balance. Everything about the experience screams quality, and every objective has a good reason for existing.Those things make this small, tightly woven world more entertaining to explore than others, and consequently Rise of the Tomb Raider is a freakin’ great experience.","Unfortunately for those sticking to the main route, Rise is a repeat of the 2013 title with less character development and several years' worth of mounting standards.","Rise of the Tomb Raider keeps the winning formula of the previous title and improves it in terms of exploration, puzzles and graphics. The mediocre AI prevents it from becoming great among greats, but the whole package is compelling thanks to the Ancient Tombs and the new game mode called Expeditions.",,"An essential purchase, and although it's a case of simply being more Tomb Raider, lessons have been learned along the way to make this one of the most refined and enjoyable blockbuster rides available.","Unfortunately the potential for a compelling story to vault Lara Croft back into legendary status did not materialise, and what you get instead is a pulpy action-adventure with a straightforward, MacGuffin-chasing story in the same vein as the reboot, right down to the cadence. The world Crystal Dynamics created here, though, is packed and has more to explore, more action to witness, and loads more tombs to find. So switch your brain off during cut-scenes, and save that mental workout for the tombs and for the path least taken.","Rise of the Tomb Raider is another interesting and modern installment in the adventure series. The campaign, despite slight problems with stereotypes, is extremely engaging and full of interesting scenes - even after the end credits.","Crystal Dynamics creates a stunning, raw and exciting adventure that improves itself in all areas. This highly enjoyable game offers more freedom and exploration than its predecessor.","The storytelling is not great in Rise of the Tomb Raider, but it does offer a lot more content, more tombs and varied fighting scenes in a very nice setting.",,,,,"Rise of the Tomb Raider is an excellent game, which acknowledged that not everything necessarily needs an innovation. The game returned one of its significant features back to the brand with grace. [Issue#258]",,,,"Rise of the Tomb Raider delivers everything you would expect from an archaeological action-adventure game, and deserves plenty of cinematic praise.",,,,"Rise of the Tomb Raider is an epic adventure, and it’s a story well told and well played.",,,,"Tombs are the best thing RotTR has to offer. Compared to the previous Tomb Raider, there really are more of them, but not quite as many as we’d want. Plus, unlike the stealth/combat sequences, most of the tombs can be skipped – although the game would’ve been much better off if it was the other way around. [Issue#204, p.62]",,,,,,"While the 2013 reboot was growth for the sake of survival, Rise is more about growth on a more personal scale. Between a fantastic story that introduces some fascinating characters, its vast open world filled with hidden elements and wild game, and a greater emphasis on solving problems with brains as much as bullets, Rise of the Tomb Raider proves to be a remarkable follow-up to Lara's origin tale.",,,,,,,,"Rise of the Tomb Raider is a game that is built on the solid foundations of the first installment of the rebooted cycle and as such it works great. Unfortunately, because of the few novelties (e.g. heavily modified crafting system), the game is no longer the emotional roller-coaster that it was during our stay on Yamatai island. As a next installment in the series the adventures of Lara Croft work well, but the famous Miss Archaeology won't come away completely unscathed from a duel with Uncharted 4.","Rise of the Tomb Raider is a solid action adventure with spectacular visuals and well-defined game mechanics. Sadly the same can't be said about the story. It seems like it was written by a six year-old Indiana Jones fan, who just got done reading The Da Vinci Code. [Dec 2015]",,"The action is fluid and the open world begs the player to experiment and explore. It's a sure fire sign that the people behind this new direction for Lara Croft really do know what they are doing, and the franchise is in good hands moving forwards.","Lara truly shines in her newest game, with a sprawling world to explore and a great set of skills at her disposal. If only the world had been even bigger, with more hub areas and even more to do, this could easily have been a truly astonishing game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Like its predecessor, Rise of the Tomb Raider is awash in stuff to do, at story's expense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Where the previous game is an over-the-top whirlwind, Rise of the Tomb Raider is better as a savored experience.","Rise of the Tomb Raider is a magnificent return to the rebooted series. While it looks, feels and plays great, Crystal Dynamics kept the formula the same. Sadly, there’s not much change or any big add-on here. It’s a better looking and better version of the previous game.",,,,,,"While the story and extras may not impress, the gameplay in Rise of the Tomb Raider holds up through a long and varied adventure. There are lots of tools to play with and utterly jaw-dropping locations to see, fleshed out with great level design. Rise of the Tomb Raider is right on par with the last game, so if you enjoyed Lara’s previous excursion, there’s plenty to look forward to here.",Quotation forthcoming.,"Despite the feelings of deja vu sprinkled throughout the 10-12 hour campaign and the flawed crafting system, Rise of the Tomb Raider is still a hell of a roller coaster ride, featuring fantastic gunplay, exceedingly clever puzzles, and a breathtaking world to explore. It may not rise above its 2013 predecessor, but it certainly meets it in the upper echelon of the third person shooter genre.",,"The traversing in a platform adventure is the most fluid and seamless I’ve ever experienced, and the story gave me chills the more I unraveled, especially with the collectibles I found.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Without a doubt, one of the best action games of this year, a must-buy for Xbox gamers.

It’s also closer to the original vision and gives us a clear feedback of a next-gen production.,"The most disappointing thing about Forza Horizon 2 is how little it’s improved since the first Horizon. There is still no meaningful career progression or economy. The career is quite literally running a circle around six chunks of Europe, over and over and over again, in the pursuit of colored bracelets with, as far as I can tell, no significance. Canned bucket list challenges and barn scavenger hunts supposedly break up the action if you feel like heading off in that direction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When stacking one against the other, it feels like Dirt Rally is the elder, more scholastic, and slightly serious sibling. Dirt 4 on the other hand, is the younger, outgoing sibling who, whilst not exactly bouncing off the walls, still knows how to have a little fun. It allows for an awesome and technical approach if you find yourself among those who crave the purest racing simulation worthy of Codemasters' reputation, but Dirt 4 now invites others less experienced to the table with alternate driving modes. They have listened to the critiques of their previous games and created a rally game that truly is for everyone.",,"DiRT 4 offers us a very good driving model, suited both to hardcore rally lovers and more casual gamers, and a satisfying variety in modes and tracks. We would have liked a greater range of locations and more stunning graphics, but what's left is however a very solid and entertaining racer.","DIRT 4 offers new possibilities to every player that wants to race, but maintains the same level of requirement for the sim racers. Good physics, outstanding gameplay and diversity of options, but this can't avoid the feeling that the game falls short on the number of cars and countries.","Dirt 4 is without any doubt the best racing videogame in terms of experience, complexity and amusement about the world of rallies. It elevates the genre to an excellency level. With an exceptional physics system and a great variety of game modes, cars and stages makes Dirt 4 a milestone tittle. The brand Dirt it's already a synonym of Rally in the world of videogames.","Dirt 4 is a terrific game, and if you never played last year's release you'll likely be blown away. I just wish there was some kind of defining feature that made Dirt 4 leap ahead of last year's game.",,"At the end of the day, DiRT 4 is left as very good racer that is let down by the odd visual and audio issue.

I feel like the career mode has a little too much micromanagement for my tastes, but I appreciate the additions. For fans of classic rally games this is by far the best it has been in years.

It lacks the feeling of life that prior games had and trades that in for a more sterile feeling. It’s a shame too because the festival setting injected a lot of fun into things, while the casual atmosphere let you go at your own pace through your career. Now, things are more rigid and while the core game is still fun, it feels like you have to do well as opposed to simply having fun being its own reward and better play resulted in faster progress. The core mechanics are excellent, though, and anyone looking for a high-quality rally racer will find one here.

Forza Motorsport 7 is the best driving simulator available on the market and one the best ever in the genre; Hands down.","Forza Motorsport 7 is a great addition to the franchise and with dynamic weather and couple of tweaks implemented in this version, this could be the best Forza ever. The campaign mode is fun and solid with tons and tons of hours to play with. Other great feature is that Forza Motorsport 7 can be played by everyone with the different difficulty settings, so it's not only for racing sim enthusiasts.

Fans will also be happy to see the return of particular circuits, including Mugello, Suzuka and the newly embellished Maple Valley, and with a potential garage of 700+ cars, there will be something for everyone, including those who want to race trucks — where else will you get that opportunity? For now, Forza Motorsport 7 remains the benchmark for console racing and it will be seventh heaven for all Forza fans everywhere.","Overall, I’ve really enjoyed Forza 7 so far, and look forward to playing more of it. The game isn’t without faults, but I’ve managed to progress at a steady pace despite the mod system and collection tiers put in place. There’s a whole host of optional events in addition to the standard races, and a nice variety of vehicle types that in turn help make most of the race experiences feel fresh and unique. If you’ve ever enjoyed the Forza series in the past, I’m sure you’ll find something to love here, regardless of what brings you to the game.","A real racing masterpiece and definitely the best game in the series so far. Technically stunning, with lots of customization options and an improved racing wheel support, Forza Motorsport 7 is the game to have for any racing game lover.","Turn10 Studios brings us what is undoubtedly the king of simulation.

Plus, even if you’ve seen some of these cars and tracks before they’ve never looked or felt this good. Racing is exciting in Forza 7 and accessible at any skill level.

Car porn is a term thrown around a lot by racing game fans and Forza Motorsport 7 is just that. It’s beautiful, a pleasure to the ears, mechanically sound and just incredibly fun to play. Variety is a huge component to what makes this such an appealing and sought after series and nothing was skimped this time around. With around 700 cars to collect, 32 tracks with multiple variations of each, a diverse set of tuning and customizations and dynamic weather effects, there is enough content here to last a long time. Also, playing online will always be a highly-engaging and especially entertaining activity, having seen so many crashes and overly assertive drivers. Sure, the campaign mode won’t win over any fans and the implementation of loot boxes can be a concerning trend for the future, but they are small blips on an overly comprehensive racer. For fans of racing games such as this, Forza Motorsport 7 offers more than you can possibly hope for. It’s a top-tier racing experience.",,"Unfortunately, Forza 7 finds itself in a similar position as Forza 6 – a title that performs well on the track, but disappoints off of it.

However, this is the road we're on.","A better Gran Turismo game than the real thing, with stunning graphics and mountains of content – although the use of loot crates and limited-use mods is worrying.","With over 30 tracks, hundreds of impressively rendered cars, and a robust and option-rich single player campaign (not to mention endless single, one-off races), Forza 7 has to represent the current apex of the racing sim. While it isn't a decisive leap forward from Forza 6, neither is it a step back. The cars just get better looking, the handling more precise, and the overall experience more comprehensive and immersive. I can't wait to try it on the Xbox One X.",,"This iteration of Forza is about attention to detail, and Turn 10 has certainly nailed it.

If you are a PC or Xbox One player, it's one of those titles you have to try.",,,,,,,"Forza Motorsport 7 provides the best mainline experience yet on the Xbox One. Forza 4 may still be the greatest overall entry thanks to its overly-generous nature of giving out cars and the in-game auction house, but Forza 7 comes very close to topping it.

It might not entirely be my cup of coffee, but it's close enough to what I like that I'm not going to turn up my nose at it. Turn 10 Studios has created another winner, but there's a creeping specter in the form of consumable mod cards and Prize Crates that undermines the more straightforward experience in previous titles. The latter threatens the soul of Forza and I hope they don't build upon those aspects in Forza Horizon 4 or Forza Motorsport 8.",,"The Forza Motorsport series makes a great comeback which works perfectly with a younger and modern look. The gameplay feels better than ever and the dynamic weather option surely feels like a drastic change compared to Forza Motorsport 6, even though there are some technical issues that we experienced and turned it into a non-cohesive game.","With almost real-life physics, a superb handling model and probably the best graphics in any racer of this generation, Forza Motorsport 7 is a serious contester for the title of racing game of the year.","After 25+ hours of gameplay, I can honestly say Forza 7 is outstanding. There is no sim that is easier to use (not Project Cars 2), has more vehicles (not Gran Tourismo’s 180), is more realistic (sorry Need For Speed), or better variety (not F1 – same car most of game), than Forza 7.

What’s even more remarkable is that it looks so good before we see the boost the Xbox One X will bring to both the visuals and the performance. There are some downsides to that fidelity, and on a standard Xbox One the load times suck a chunk of the fun from the experience, while the game’s internal economy also looks likely to cause problems further down the line.

And on the track, Forza impresses with a ton of cars and intense races. Unfortunately the somewhat terrible AI, a few game breaking bugs and a complete lootbox-craze left us a with a sour taste. We still enjoy our time with the game, but it is not as fine-tuned as expected.","Forza 7 is the most extensive race game ever from Turn 10.

I would’ve much rather spent this space talking about the fantastic driving experience, the way the game can be tailored to any desired skill level with the bevy of options, the incredible car customization (when applicable), the beautiful graphics, the astounding attention to detail in the car models, and the sheer, unrelenting car-porn that Forza 7 provides. On the other hand, anyone who’s paid attention to this series already knows this — not much has changed, and the stuff that has changed like the VIP support, currency manipulation and the homologated career mode will leave longtime fans perplexed why this route was taken. Forza 7 is a fantastic driving title that can’t stop tripping over itself, and its majestic driving experience is overshadowed by a lack of new ideas and suspicious economic decisions.","Forza Motorsport 7 is the best episode of the series developed by Turn 10, a title that stands out as an absolute reference within the simcade genre and boasts a solid, convincing, faceted and enjoyable driving model.",,"I can’t deny that Forza Motorsport 7’s racing is some of the most fun there is, but its overabundance of progression systems make it more of a grind than it should be.","Forza 7 is the best looking and most comprehensive entry to date.

(It's also massive, clocking in at 67GB on the Xbox One.) And yes, Forza might be a little artificial at times—some bleed in from the Horizon games perhaps—and its engine might be biased toward flair and fun.

This version of the franchise continues to evolve the sim/circuit experience that it aims to conquer, and it is accessible to all levels of racing fans and general gamers alike. The visuals and sound make for a presentation that is next to none on the Xbox One, and the gameplay feature set is one that will keep you playing for months to come. The Prize Crates have me a bit concerned about the possibility of monetization, but there is nothing written in stone yet. Right now I have to give a big ol’ congratulations to Turn 10, as they have once again set the bar high for the Forza Motorsport franchise, and I will be honest here, I can’t wait to see what the retail version looks like on the Xbox One X come November 7th.","With a long and flexible solo campaign, quick multiplayer setups (including couch co-op), fun challenges, and lots ways to tweak your ride, wardrobe, and income, Turn 10 Studios continues to perfect their skill with another entry in one of the best racing series in the industry.",,"The driving is excellent, there’s an enormous amount of cars to explore, and the improvements to weather and race length are appreciated.

In fairness, the game does almost get to the point where, like in mobile free-to-play games, you'll feel an urge to spend real money just to speed progress up a little.

Good news is that each of those three games has the polished classic gameplay of the saga, and links it to different concepts.

Its new proposal and the Battle Royale mode make it a must of this generation.,"Sacrifices had to be made, but the gamble of chopping off a short single player campaign to focus on multiplayer modes that will offer many more hours of fun has paid off. Multiplayer and Zombies are much better off because of it, and newcomer Blackout sets Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 up as the most well-rounded multiplayer shooter of the year.",,"Many will be happy to see the most popular side to Call of Duty given the main focus this time around, but the lack of anything new and intuitive makes it feel more like a rushed out cash grab than a genuine new entry into one of the world’s most popular franchises.","Essentially, Black Ops 4 a Frankenstein Monster of a FPS experience.

It is the most complete multiplayer package the series has ever seen. The three modes complement each other well. The Battle Royale mode is fantastic. Multiplayer feels great for veteran players. Zombies is neat if not a bit mundane before it ends. Still, there is a lot here, and for those wanting that online CoD experience will find plenty bang for their buck. I miss the campaign, but they have definitely made up for it for those interested in killing other players online.",,,,"In pruning the campaign from its suite of modes, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 has discovered a renewed focus on the nuts and bolts of what most players demand from Activision's undying shooter series. Blackout is a superb addition, in which Treyarch improves upon the battle royale formula, ensuring the gamble in losing single-player ultimately pays off.","Deprived of its usual solo campaign, Call of Duty Black Ops 4 looks more like a patchwork than a whole, tight experience. Nonetheless, its multiple game modes, among which the first AAA Battle Royale, have enough to offer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The title features more modes, settings, and ways to engage than any game in the series I can recall.

Solo players can have a lot of fun with Black Ops 4, though ranking up in multiplayer can be a bit of a frustrating slog through hours of humiliation at the hands of experienced series veterans.

It honestly makes me excited to play Call of Duty online again.","Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 is a game that looks at the entire first-person shooter genre, past and present, takes all the best ideas, and assembles them into what feels like the easiest to recommend shooter I have ever played. The only caveat to that recommendation is that some gamers will find themselves absolutely ignoring two thirds of what the game has to offer, and that makes me wonder if a different model of monetization would have been better suited for what feels like a collection of three different games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s still far behind the first two Assassin’s Creed games, but it also feels like a new beginning for the series. All in all, the future looks bright.",,,Origins successfully adds to the franchise of Assassin’s Creed by delivering something fresh yet similar. It plays like a treat on the Xbox One X and thanks to the 4K graphics is easily one of the most immersive titles as you explore Ancient Egypt and its connecting lands.,,"Origins provides a much-needed change in direction for the Assassin’s Creed franchise. The range of new action-RPG elements isn’t especially innovative but they do more than enough to make the previously tired gameplay feel fresh and engaging. The world is beautiful and dense, the characters are interesting, and the story offers enough mystery and intrigue to keep players coming back before it sadly ends far too quickly. Assassin’s Creed Origins isn’t perfect, but it points to a long and healthy future for the series.",,"Ubisoft successfully managed to renew the series, turning it into a proper open world action-RPG, with tons of interesting contents and an high longevity. A must buy for any lover of the series and a good reason to come back for lapsed gamers.","After a more than deserved rest, Assassin’s Creed makes its comeback with one of the best entries of the saga. Despite the story may not meet the expectations of some fans, its big and deep world alongside the new gameplay mechanics are enough reasons to give a chance to one of the best releases of Ubisoft on the actual generation of consoles.","Assassin's Creed Origins takes us on an extensive journey through Ancient Egypt to discover the origins of the brotherhood. Its excellent artistic section, together with a renewed and well developed gameplay, shows that large projects require slow cooking. The wait has been worth it, as Origins is what you always wanted to see in the Assassin's Creed franchise, which we ventured to say, is already its best title.",,"The RPG side of the game is handled very well, and its challenge is really very good in the larger modern gaming landscape. Combat still needs tweaking from a design perspective, but is more than passable while the checklisty mission system does need a major overhaul, but when stacked against the game-world created here, and how much content it’s filled with, it can be forgiven.","If you’ve played any of the other Assassin’s Creed games in the franchise, then stop reading this and buy Origins right now. If you’ve always been curious about playing, and want to try an action adventure, with RPG elements, or feel like taking in a great story and beautiful locations (that will look even better with the Xbox One X), then give it a go.",,,"Assassin’s Creed Origins is a deep-dive into a truly stunning realization of ancient Egypt, with a rich series of cultures, genuine characters, and more mission variety than any other game in the series.","Not completely back to the drawing board, Ubisoft takes some of their better old ideas and blends them with new ones to make one of the best Assassin's Creed games to date in Assassin's Creed Origins.","Assassin’s Creed Origins is one of the best open-world action games of this generation. The setting is quite evocative, the plot is engaging and there are also good endgame activities. The Creed is reborn.","With a stream of post-launch content bolstering what it is already an epic 50-hour-plus adventure, Assassin’s Creed Origins is one of the most engrossing and awe-inspiring experiences of the year, especially on Xbox One X where the visuals are pushed to the max. You can nit-pick all you like about the odd funny glitch here and there and some duff NPC dialogue, but Assassin’s Creed Origins is a near flawless open-world gaming experience.","Assassin's Creed: Origins is as much a departure as it is a homecoming. Revamped combat mechanics defibrillate the series with much-needed challenge. The guided open-world design encourages and rewards exploration unlike any Assassin's Creed game before it, and takes place in one of the series’ most memorable settings. But at the end of the day, and despite some growing pains, Origins is a culmination of the best aspects of the series. And for that, some hiccups in the transition to full-fledged RPG are a fair trade.","I could go on and on about how much I’ve fallen in love with the setting, the improvements to the core gameplay, and the way it feels like Ubisoft have breathed new life into the franchise. The year off and restructure of the game has done wonders for it, almost bringing Assassin’s Creed into the RPG territory rather than just being and action adventure game. While I can see some being disappointed in that aspect, I love role playing games, loot, and exploration, and Assassin’s Creed nails these new elements while still feeling like an Assassin’s Creed game at its core. Combat is the biggest hurdle getting used to, and when the camera doesn’t work in tandem, feels a bit messy. Otherwise, aside from some odd visual glitches that randomly occurred in my game, or some rather typical AI follies, I have little issues with Origins. It’s one of the best Assassin’s Creeds games I’ve played, and probably one of my all-time favorites right after Black Flag and the controversial AC III. This one was worth the wait. Now time to get back to exploring another ancient tomb!",,,,"A welcome sea change for Assassin's Creed, Origins is not only a hugely ambitious open-world action RPG, but also a game that breathes new life into a series that was in danger of losing its way. Assassin's Creed Origins stands as a genuinely fantastic game and a remarkable achievement.",,"This is a stunningly successful modernisation of the franchise, a beautiful representation of one of the most engrossing societies in history and great story. The old bones of the Assassin's Creed series are definitely here, but for the most part the game's been reinvigorated with RPG mechanics and a more thoughtful, exploration-based style.","Assassin's Creed has undergone many changes in its long and storied history, and Origins feels like the first step in the start of a new journey. It has its fair share of problems, but the vision for its future is one worth pursuing.",,,"Assassin's Creed Origins does enough things differently to warrant a look, but there is still something left to be desired. It's a lengthy game in a huge and varied open world that provides a foundation for what's to come, but it doesn't quite offer the breakthrough that the series was probably looking for.",,"In essence, Assassin’s Creed Origins is much the same game as the original Assassin’s Creed, which came out a decade ago. It’s a formula that people like to play, and it’s certainly been honed and improved over the years. Origins is, then, undoubtedly the best iteration of this formula yet. But I yearn for a fresh approach and new ideas, something that astounds the senses as much as the wondrous world this game inhabits.",,,"For me Origins is the best game in the series, a beginning of a new era for the long-running franchise. I was awestruck by how huge, varied and believable its world is and how dense it is with all sorts of appealing activities. I welcomed the completely redesigned combat system, which bids farewell to the old “press X to win” feature. Apart from various glitches and technical issues (often resulting from game’s complexity) my only serious charge against Origins is that it sets up its story poorly and fails to keep it tight. [13/2017, p.68]",,,,"Origins is more than the sum of its parts - which by the way are not influenced by the franchises’ past but also by games like Witcher 3 or Horizon. While a lot of old and new elements show untapped potential, this still is the best Assassin’s Creed since Black Flag.",,,"The extra year of development has helped Assassin’s Creed as a whole, as Origins is the next level for the series. It’s bigger, better and more robust than ever before, featuring an engaging combat system and surprisingly compelling side quests. That isn’t to say there isn’t anything wrong with it, though, as traversal remains clumsy, the mission structure can get repetitive and the AI can be either overly aggressive or plain dumb to the point of frustration.",,"Origins doesn’t completely rebuild Assassin’s Creed, but makes a number of smart, significant changes to a formula that, despite yearly updates, was showing its age. The increased freedom in how you approach targets, the more active combat, and alluring world not only make exploring Egypt a rewarding experience, but also offer a strong direction for the series going forward while still remembering what made it unique in the first place.","After many uninspired titles, Assassin’s Creed Origins is bigger, prettier and, quite frankly, more fun than any other game in the series so far. It helps, of course, that Cleopatra’s Egypt is a fascinating place that begs to be discovered. Who wouldn’t want to climb the pyramids?",,,,,,"Assassin's Creed Origins manages to combine familiarity with revolution. Its RPG mechanics, new combat system and equiment management make you feel a fresh enough experience. The map is huge, beautiful and detailed, supported by an outstanding artistic direction. Unfortunately, the narrative fails to captivate us to make it closer to perfection.",,,,,,,,,,"Assassin's Creed Origins shakes up the series' combat, loot, and progression, while retaining the atmosphere, impressive open world, and historical bent that has made the franchise so beloved.",,,,"Origins can’t entirely shake some of those Assassin’s Creed foibles, it can still be buggy and a little bloated, but it also retains much of what made the series popular in the first place. A fascinating historical setting, fleet-footed action and intrigue aplenty.",,,"If Assassin's Creed Origins is not perfect, it perfectly understood what it had to do to regain the hearts of the players and fans of the series. In addition to delivering the mysterious and fascinating ancient Egypt on a silver plate, in an absolutely gigantic open world, full of activities and secrets to discover, it succeeds in transforming its gameplay by brilliantly integrating RPG elements and completely renewing, with no less talent, its combat system. It will literally absorbs you for dozens and dozens of hours. Assassin's Creed Origins succeeds in taking care of its fans and its fundamentals, while starting its own revolution. We can only hope that the subsequent episodes will keep this momentum.","There are still a few issues here and there: combat is better, but could stand for some tightening and assassination needs a dedicated, consistent button. But overall, this is a very good game and stands near the top of the series. Bayek's story is an excellent one and as a soft reboot for the franchise, Origins does its job. I'm looking forward to seeing where they go from here.",,,"AC Origins is definitely a back to the roots (story and gameplay wise) effort with a great setting, a well written script and amazing visual department. The action rpg elements, though well implemented, leave much to be desired and side quests are blunt and indifferent. However, the late Hellenistic Egypt is a vibrant world with much to do and many secrets to unveil.",,,,"Assassin’s Creed Origins is a clever chapter, able to renew the spirit of the saga without changing it. Some RPG elements, a beautiful art design and a quite solid combat system allow Origins to become a new starting point for the series.","Origins takes the best parts of the Assassin's Creed series and the best of the free roam RPG games and builds an extraordinary enjoyable world. You will want to keep playing, discovering its secrets and fight every combat in its amazingly designed World.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Origins can pretty much be considered one of the best entries in the series (if not the best) for introducing a myriad of changes, all for the best, and making the series advance in the same way Assassin's Creed II did back in the day. Put it into a sarcophagus next to the pharaohs, because this game is worth of the Valley of the Kings.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Ubisoft Montreal's game is a cornucopia of every idea and mechanic seen in the series, inspired by many other games of its ilk and reinforced by its splendid historical background, thus representing a strong step in the right direction. Still, it's an imperfect game, partially plagued by the simplicity of some of its parts and the underdevelopment of some systems.",,,A revamped design breathes new life into the franchise. Origins is the start of something great.,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’re an Assassin’s Creed fan like myself, and thirst for any new entry, Origins is an absolute no-brainer, as this is easily one of the best in the series. Mechanically there’s so much new here that the series once again feels fresh, and the world so large that there’s always something new to uncover and explore. If you’re new to the series, or haven’t played the last few ga,es, Origins is a great point to jump in, especially since the narrative takes place before others and sets up the subsequent games in the timeline. Oh, and it doesn't hurt that it is easily one of the best looking games on the market right now, not just for the series, but playing on an Xbox One X in 4K is amazing.","Whether you’re a devout member of the Creed, someone who’s fallen off the hay wagon, or even a prospective new member of the Brotherhood, this is the time to dig your blade deep into a succulent new Assassin’s Creed.",,"Assassin’s Creed Origins isn’t the reinvention of the prolific franchise that many had hoped for. Instead, it refines the formula put in place a decade ago while telling an important story about the Assassins. Ancient Egypt is a compelling playground to explore, and the RPG elements make it easy to stay engaged. If you love the franchise, Origins is an easy recommendation. Just don’t except much change.",,,,,,,,"Assassin’s Creed: Origins is the most memorable entry in the series in years, answering age-old questions like “why are assassins missing their ring fingers?” and is an excellent game to start with if you’re a newcomer.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite some hard-to-miss flaws, Assassin's Creed: Origins makes one hell of an impression. The game is such a big leap from AC Syndicate, the same way ACII was an improvement when compared to the first game. Fans of the Assassin universe simply need to play this game. Ubisoft proves that they still have something interesting to say in their biggest franchise.",,,,"Assassin's Creed: Origins packs many new tricks, yet feels dated.

Excellent gameplay, albeit slightly repetitive, brilliant world-building and graphics/audio to die for, The Outer Worlds should definitely be on your gaming radar!","As a recent addition to the Microsoft Game Studios family, Obsidian have put their best foot forward with The Outer Worlds. Solid gun play, an engaging story with great, likeable characters and a world that is fun to explore and interact with. Some missions let the side down a little and the game could be bigger but with so many nods to the great RPG predecessors and taking the best elements from them this is a great game to pick up.","Aiming for the stars worked admirably for Obsidian Entertainment with this fantastic sci-fi RPG. There are elements of Obsidian's earlier work, especially Fallout: New Vegas which will delight longtime fans. Yet The Outer Worlds excels most when it has fun within its own unique identity. The wealth of lore and world-building details could be a little overwhelming for brand new players, but a little confusion early on shouldn't stop anyone from taking The Outer Worlds for a spin.",,"Obsidian delivers a multi-layered RPG, offering great freedom of choice to the player in a fascinating new world. Its only faults - a bit too little content and a modest technical production - lay in its medium-budget nature, but it's definitely a game to try for any RPG lover.","It's great to see Obsidian again in a genre where it knows how to do things so well, with a project that is among the most anticipated games of the year. The Outer Worlds is not perfect, it is limited and its formula outdated in some aspects, but it fulfills all that it promises. A new first-person role-playing adventure with an interesting narrative, charismatic characters, brilliant conversations and hundreds of playable possibilities where everyone can be whoever they want to be.",The Outer Worlds is simply one of the best RPGs of the generation.,"The Outer Worlds is an utterly tremendous achievement that showcases the best of Obsidian's writing wit, world-building detail, and character focus. The game borrows heavily from other major beloved RPG franchises that have fallen out of favor with shareholders in recent years, which is perhaps ironic given the game's extreme-Capitalism plot beats. Obsidian fills that forgotten niche with confidence and rigor.","The Outer Worlds, as per this very review, will be compared to Fallout by many who play it. And really, it’s the sort of comparison that will probably benefit Obsidian’s latest RPG in the long run. Because in the end, Halcyon and its many denizens, corporations, and quirks feel like an original creation worthy of this style of RPG. And much like with the original Fallout, a place well worth visiting again in a larger and more expansive experience. Like, say, in The Outer Worlds 2.","All in all and The Outer Worlds on Xbox One is so much more than Fallout in space, and I honestly think you owe it to yourself to play this game. This is one of the most entertaining gaming experiences I’ve played this year, and I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone and everyone.",,,,,The Outer Worlds is a solid and well written experience but it lacks Fallout's depth and lore.,"Put the essence of the Fallout, Mass Effect and Borderlands series into a blender, and what you get is The Outer Worlds. It’s an open-world adventure that lets you visit run-down planets and face their hostilities. There are people to recruit, relationships to maintain and difficult decisions to be made. And it’s all wrapped in a lighthearted tone, although not at the expense of a strong story; The Outer Worlds really does have good dialogue. It’s just a shame that you spend so much time running though environments that feel deader than Fallout’s wastelands.",,,,,"The Outer Worlds is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from Obsidian. The first-person action RPG features a great setting, fantastic writing and remarkable, complex characters to meet. The moment-to-moment gameplay isn't as exciting, though, failing to measure up with the best in the genre. Still, there's plenty to like here as long as you know what you're getting into, not to mention the potential for a sequel to be much better, particularly if the developers had a higher budget to work with.","The Outer Worlds is not only a breath of fresh air and easily one of Obsidian’s best ever games, but it's an experience that can truly wear the player choice badge with pride. From the RPG elements to how you play, The Outer Worlds truly is your adventure. Just don’t kill anyone’s parents in it, okay?","Yes, The Outer Worlds has all that we wanted from the writers of Fallout New Vegas. But, while bringing that weird universe with a great liberty of actions, nice questing and a good amount of content (around 20 hours with replayability), the game fails to be à 2019 game. The companion system and the AI don't work quite well, and the global graphics and technical design are weak.","The Outer Worlds is a well-written, novel, gorgeous roleplaying game, made for today using some of yesterday's best tricks. If you fall into the trap of using fast travel it can feel like ticking off to-do list items instead of adventuring. But if you force yourself to slow down and let the sharp dialogue, otherworldly vistas, and intriguing characters work their magic, it's one of the best roleplaying experiences of the last few years.","The Outer Worlds is consistently compelling throughout, and it's a superb example of how to promote traditional RPG sensibilities in a sharp, modern experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While I'll admittedly take Fallout 3 over New Vegas any day, I'll happy throw the entire Fallout series to the side for The Outer Worlds, Obsidian's own original IP.","The Outer Worlds is a thinking-man's Fallout 4. While Bethesda failed to push its venerable RPG series into a more thoughtful direction, Obsidian Entertainment thankfully is still around to show them how it is done. Conceptually, the idea of a dystopian space system that is ruled by a board of monopolies could not have been executed more deftly.",,"Obsidian knows what to do. Knowing why Fallout New Vegas was liked, they have created a spiritual successor that focuses on its strengths and adds an exquisite sense of humor to make us spend a few entertaining hours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Obsidian has created the RPG that Bethesda didn't wanted to make before and after Fallout 76. A great adventure that you should experience.,,,,,,"The Outer Worlds is not as solid as other recent games from Obsidian, but is a very good game for hardcore RPG fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A spiritual successor to Fallout: New Vegas in every way, The Outer Worlds is better written and more polished than we've since come to expect from the franchise it emulates.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Of course, whether you’ll like this game depends on whether or not you liked Fallout 3, New Vegas and/or 4. If you did, then The Outer Worlds should be right up your alley. However, if you didn’t, then it may be best to look at something different. As great as it is, it won’t be for everyone. Then again, that’s true of pretty much anything. What's nice about The Outer Worlds though, is that it can be downloaded and tried for next to nothing, through Game Pass.",,"There is no doubt that The Outer Worlds is a decent RPG with tons of interesting missions, and I really enjoyed my 30 hours spent in the game. But I think Obsidian could have done better in terms of storytelling.","While there are some details to refine, what stands out most is just how complete and cohesive The Outer Worlds is. Every system works in tandem. Companions support your skills, people comment on what you wear, and choices have lasting consequences. There are so many variables in how the story can go, but as you play, it does such an excellent job of reinforcing your decisions and making you feel like you’re on the right path.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Outer Worlds looks too much like Fallout New Vegas without being able to stand out. The few innovative mechanics it incorporates don't work very well and the exploration is disappointing, with ridiculously small, uninteresting areas. Still, at the end of the day, the gameplay is rather pleasant, the story and characters that grow a little more as you go along and the replayability can make the difference, as long as the ""Elder Scrolls"" formula doesn't turn you off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In F1 2016, the company delivers the deep, intricate racing experience we should have enjoyed a year sooner, and the title is loaded with all the depth and customization that F1 enthusiasts can handle, while also welcoming clutch-wary newcomers.

Sporting over 200 hours worth of gameplay, complete with refinements and added extras, returning to Spira should be a no-brainer.",,,,"Final Fantasy X was the end of a golden age in the history of this franchise. It may be that the nostalgia intensifies the situation, but in this episode, it's hard not to get caught by one of the most complete stories of recent years, with charismatics, characters and a gameplay between between tradition and the avant-garde.

halo-the-master-chief-collection,,,The 13th year anniversary of Halo comes with a blast: the re-release of all the greatest Halo hits without the need of changing console. A must have compilation for veterans and a chance for newcomers to unravel the origins of the Halo phenomenon that changed first person shooters and the world.,,Halo the Master Chief Collection is the definitive version of this amazing series that plays and looks amazingly on the XBox One.,,,"Hopefully, for those that bought Halo: TMCC a permanent fix comes along sooner than later, or you can get some enjoyment out of the single-player experience for the time being. But it’s certainly not fair to wait for the product your purchased to work, and because of that, I want to be sure that my review score for this retail product reflects that.","Halo: The Master Chief Collection isn't just a simple re-publishing of old games: it's an opera omnia that gives us a comprehensive and structured view on the past of the series and reminds us why those games are considered amongst of the best ones in their genre. Unluckily it's hindered by many problems in the multiplayer department, something that will surely be resolved but, at the time of writing, makes it simply unplayable online.",,,,"Despite an unhealthy smattering of technical concerns, Halo: The Master Chief Collection really is an essential purchase for fans of the series, whether they’re in it for the campaigns, the multiplayer, or the best of both worlds.",,,,"This collection delivers more than a huge Halo fan like myself could have reasonably imagined and, even with its (hopefully temporary) online issues, it packs an insane amount of first-person shooter greatness onto one disc.",,"The definitive experience for every Halo fan out there. If you enjoyed the Master Chief campaign and the epic Halo multiplayer, you’ll love this project. The average Halo 3 porting is the ""worst"" part of this anthology, but the game is still as good as most FPS available today.",,,"If you own an Xbox One this game is a must own. If not, it might be time to buy one.",,,,,,,"And it's a testament to the quality of Halo games throughout the years that Halo: The Master Chief Collection is an attractive package, despite the massive problems with online multiplayer.","While the campaign, UI and added value of betas and TV shows give Halo: MCC a lot to shout about, shoddy matchmaking means one of the biggest talking points for fans is being discussed for all the wrong reasons.",,,,"Sets a bar that other remasters and collections will have difficulty reaching, much less topping. For players new to Halo, who have missed any of the included games, it is a stunning introduction to one of the most beloved series in video games.

Vital to any collection.

The multiplayer suite is truly the saving grace of this package and worth the price of admission alone.","A great pack of four games full of content: over hundred multiplayer maps, great variety of modes, four epic and intense co-op campaigns and smoother visuals for the remake of Halo 2. It's a must have for any Xbox One owner.","Massive, complete and nostalgic, Halo: The Master Chief Collection isn’t just a greatest hits collection. It’s a legacy that paves the way for what’s still to come.","If you take into consideration the single player campaigns and those alone, then what you get is a wonderful remaster, one of the best ever done on a famous brand.

In terms of the content itself, this package is astounding. Four of the best shooter campaigns ever made, in one box, all running at 1080p at 60fps, Halo has never looked so good. Throw in over 100 multiplayer maps and a bevy of Halo themed extras and you have a recipe for a true system seller.","Longtime Halo fans get the opportunity to quickly and easily revisit their favourite levels, or jump into a reinvigorated multiplayer; newcomers to the series get the best, most seamless experience of the Halo series.","Excellent choice for people new to the series, but also a treat for Halo fans who can add this great edition to their collections.","One last time 343 Industries (and consorts Ruffian, Saber and Certain Affinity) honors Bungie's legacy with an ode so expansive, that it beats Halo: Reach as the ultimate Halo-package. Halo fans, who probably already own Halo Anniversary, should get this for the 106 MP-maps and Halo 2 Anniversary with its amazing new cut-scenes, plus, of course, the Halo 5: Guardians beta, and should consider Halo 3 and 4 to be very, very nice bonuses.","The Master Chief Collection prepares a new generation of console gamers for one of the best shooter series ever made.

age-of-wonders-planetfall,,,,,"Age of Wonders: Planetfall is truly an awesome game and is excellent value for money. I can only describe this game as a console love child of the beloved board games Monopoly and Chess. Players, like myself, can easily find themselves spending 15+ hours on a single level, trying to complete all of the optional and story-based objectives. The one drawback of the game is that it’s not something that can be completed quickly and requires a level of planning and patience to play. However, this game does offer something for everyone regardless of experience or age.","Despite having a vertical drop for a learning curve and looking and feeling kind of average as far as modern gaming goes, Age of Wonders: Planetfall succeeds in being a richly deep and complex space strategy hybrid that will no doubt appeal to long time turn-based strategy fans, and newcomers alike.",,,"Age of Wonders: Planetfall is simply a must-have for any strategy games lover out there. Incredibly deep, varied and addictive, it masterfully mixes management and diplomacy traits with turn-based tactics.

It offers an experience that only the most veteran of the strategy will enjoy, but that anyone will know to value. It is a titanic project that offers countless hours of gameplay and endless playable possibilities as well as stories. Undoubtedly a must-have of the turn-based strategy.",,,"The game itself, if you follow the heavily developer-directed path laid before you, has roughly 20-25 hours in it, and there’s more content yet to come, so balances and new content could sharpen the experience, but out of the gate it’s simply a schizophrenic collection of two key genres that, in principle, should gel, but here they kind of get in each other’s way.","Age of Wonders: Planetfall on Xbox One is easily one of the best in the genre, putting so many elements together into one fantastic package.

Those who only want to race two or three laps at a time will miss the amazing changing track conditions, so this is a title that is for racers, for those more interested in the details of motorsport in general and a much more immersive experience. The title continues to push the genre forward and continues where other titles stop.",,"The perfect evolution of Slightly Mad's series, delivering an extremely satisfying racing experience both for expert gamers and newbies, finally capable of competing with the top titles in the genre.","Project Cars 2 is a good alternative for all players looking for a simracing in their Xbox One. The game isn't perfect but offers an inmersive experience that provides good driving feelings to challenge a professional career through many disciplines, including the exciting rallycross. Technically the game improves its performance, but it doesn’t evolve so much, having some problems with AIs. Project Cars 2 is a good game for anyone who wants to drive facing the challenge that offers, but maybe this makes the game less attractive than the alternatives. It's one of the best driving car games you can find at this moment.","Project Cars 2 comes with strength this year as the best simulator developed by Slightly Mad Studios, reinforced with a surprising physics system and also including a new online competition mode and accompanied by the debut of Rally Cross. A jewel you can't miss.","Although the first Project Cars didn't quite capture the hearts of mainstream gamers, the sequel has a much better shot thanks to its polished career mode, wealth of motorsport types, and unparalleled track selection. The difficulty is still on the unapproachable side, but racing sim fans will likely stick it out anyway. I'll be surprised if Forza 7 doesn't top this one overall, but it's still great to have options – especially one that appears on both Xbox and PlayStation.","As a fan of all things racing if push came to running start I'd probably place myself firmly in the garage of an arcade racing fan. Ahem. But as with the first game in the series I found a great deal of enjoyment with Project Cars 2. The graphics and sound especially won me over. And whilst the struggles, trials, and tribulations of such a demanding simulator may have left me shaking with rage, the sheer exhilaration I felt after hitting a series of apexes so perfectly, culminating in a podium finish, was sweet recompense.","Project Cars 2 is indeed a quality racer, one well worth the time of anyone looking for an ultra-realistic experience. Those coming in as casual racers may find the controls a little harsh, but the general nature of racing a high-performance car is certainly put into perspective, and that should be praised in any game looking to give a simulation experience.",,,"Project CARS 2 plays like a pumped-up version of the classic TOCA Race Driver 3 from 2006, redressing many of the complaints levelled at the original.",,,"Project CARS 2 won’t please all racing game fans, but it’ll delight those who crave realism and a challenge; those who want to push themselves to be better. Is that you?",,"Project Cars 2 is the definition of what a sequel should be, taking everything great from the original game, bringing it back, and introducing new and interesting features. Everything feels finely tuned and the options are unparalleled. This is a dream for racing fans and a treat for anyone who even slightly enjoys the genre. Don’t sleep on this one, there are few racing games that offer this much in one package.",,,,"Project CARS 2 is a great sequel to a strong but flawed first instalment.

There is undoubtedly a good game in there as the handling and visuals are exceptional, but it is capable of so much more.",,,,,,,,,,,"Project Cars 2 is a worthy successor to the original game and fixes some of its issues. It still isn’t the most user-friendly game for newcomers, but in time you can get used to its quirks. The game definitely has a learning curve to it, so anyone looking to just jump in and dominate will be humbled quickly. You have to play with a nuanced style and can’t rely on assists to do the hard work of the race for you. It’s a challenging but rewarding experience and the dramatic increase in vehicle types and tracks, alongside new weather setups makes the experience one to remember. Project Cars 2 isn’t for everyone, but anyone who likes a good challenge and loves a finely-tuned racing game will enjoy it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"With all of the trailers, experts, and attention to detail, I expected Project Cars 2 to take the trophy as racing sim of the year. It is definitely not. What you DO get is a game that challenges you to a frustrating degree and does so with beautiful precision. It sadly also takes a bunch of the fun out of it too.",,,,,,,,Project Cars 2 final offers a real alternative to console racing fans and brings to the table a fantastic roster of cars and tracks. Combined with an excellent simulation of track and weather conditions Project Cars 2 is pretty much the pinnacle of racing on console.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Project Cars 2 is an exquisite racing simulator that makes learning the game almost as much fun as winning a race. It demands perfection, refuses to ease up, and still manages to be friendly enough for newcomers.",,,,,,,,,,"Those who aren't huge fans of the genre may find Project CARS 2 a little too uncompromising, even if it is much more accessible than the first time around. If you just want to pick a fast car from the get-go and dive right in, you may find the learning curve too steep. But it looks good—especially in VR on the PC—and there are some cars and tracks that you simply won't find in any other current racing title. What's more, it's a significant step forward from the first Project CARS game. All told, CARS 2 should be catnip for the racing enthusiast.",,,,,,,"A true racing masterpiece, Project Cars 2 takes a lot of the negatives from the first game and actually improves upon them in such a drastic and dynamic way that the transition is as different as night and day. Slightly Mad Studios has set themselves a lofty goal of making Project Cars 2 the best simulation racing game available on the Xbox platform, and I think that they have succeeded triumphantly. In fact, Project Cars 2 doesn't set the bar to a new standard, it single handedly renders any other simulation racing game obsolete. Slightly Mad Studios developed a colossal racing game, and that everything about it became bigger and better and more dynamic, and that game is called Project Cars 2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A proficient sim-racer that brings a lot to the table - both in content and playability.

Beenox's game is just as fun as the original and it adds a lot of content, what makes it enjoyable for hundreds of hours.","Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled is a must have for those who play looking for fun. Flawless mechanics, a lot of options and of course the nostalgia factor.",,,Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled on Xbox One is now undoubtedly the line in the sand; the new benchmark to beat that has left all its competitors’ way off in the distance.,,,,,,,,"Crash Team Racing Nitro Fueled is a beautiful trip back in time. It is also great that PS4 and XB1 owners finally have a truly great kart racer available on their machines. This game is a must-own for anyone that loves these types of games, and for the price it is impossible not to recommend.

Packed to the gills with content, this drive down memory lane still contains a sense of the original’s magic, and artfully decorates your favorite tracks and drivers with an impeccable attention to detail. But it’s not immune to the modern era, and the looming threat of live-service DLC and nostalgia-grabbing looms heavy over the entire game.",,,,,,,,,,"Those who enjoyed the original back on the original PlayStation, or newcomers to the series looking for a new karting title shouldn’t pass on Nitro-Fueled. It might not be perfect, but it’s certainly got enough going for it to make a solid challenge for Mario’s crown as the king of kart racers.",,,"It’s safe to say that anyone who has nostalgia for Spyro or Crash will likely have a great time with Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, and while the difficulty will be polarizing, the game is stuffed with content, and since it’s available at a budget price, picking it up is a no-brainer.",,,,,,Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled Review is a fast paced racer and a great remaster.

There is just a ton of content here that should keep avid fans busy for months to come. The Adventure Mode is pretty decent, with just the right amount of humor thrown in, although the difficulty levels probably could use some tweaking. Easy was way too easy, Medium was a bit too hard, and Hard was… well, not worth the frustration. However, the positives far outweigh the negatives and I wouldn’t be surprised if most of the issues I’ve mentioned are addressed in future patches. Needless to say, if you’re looking for a fun, racing game, you really can’t go wrong with Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed my time with Crash Team Racing: Nitro Fueled, as it brought the original PSone game to life with modern day visuals and sound, and I got to play it on the Xbox One. There is a heck of a lot to do in the game too, so you won’t get through it too quickly, and for completionists out there, you’ll enjoy all that the game has you doing. It’s worth reiterating that the game can be tough, and that is something you’ll have to adjust to, as you memorize the tracks, their shortcuts and all. Don’t let this fact keep you from playing it though, as there is a lot of fun here for those who have not played the game in the past, and for those returning to the world of Crash Team Racing, you’ll be very happy with this remaster too.","Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled feels a bit too derivative, obviously borrowing ideas from competitors. But it’s also the most distinctly challenging of the bunch, almost working best as a single-player endeavor rather than a fun, multiplayer party game. It’s hard to tell if there’s room for that, as Activision itself seemed to struggle with how to sell this one. Crash Bandicoot fans will certainly be happy, and are likely already on board. Those looking for a challenge will have a good time chasing trophies.

It has style, it has charm, and more importantly, it has the interesting concept of allowing the player to shape the foundation of the game along with the characters and their motivations. It’s something I don’t think I have ever seen done before, at least, not in this sort of scale. Fans of story driven games such as this will have a great time with it.

The game brings us back South Park's true self, with its iconic characters, locations and superpowers. Despite not evolving enough from Stick of Truth, The Fractured But Whole offers us a funny and well executed adventure. Join Coon & Friends to save the world.","South Park: The Fractured But Whole is an excellent continuation of its first title, which comes loaded with humour and action. Maybe there are more complete games among the RPG genre, but not as fun and endearing as the new South Park title, which is coming to try to please both fans of the series and newcomers alike. A must have.","A hilarious, entertaining role-playing game that is sure to entertain fans of the popular TV show for hours upon hours.

While it is very similar to South Park: The Stick of Truth, and just as much fun, the theme change from medieval fantasy to comic book superheroes makes this feel different and new. In the end the game may be funnier than it is fun, but it's still a good time.",,,"South Park: The Fractured But Whole is a case of one step forward, two steps back. From a gameplay perspective, it’s infinitely better than it was in the previous outing, but as a piece of entertainment, The Fractured But Whole simply doesn't measure up to The Stick of Truth. There's no censorship this time, which is good, but it almost feels like the whole thing got self-censored somewhere along the way.",,"Anyone who enjoys South Park is bound to love this game, as it's essentially a 20-hour-long episode where you get to direct some of the action. The video game aspect of the experience isn't perfect — aside from still-pretty-basic combat system navigating around the town is a bit clunky and the crafting system is mostly an excuse for you to find humorous things in people's trash — but this is a cool RPG wrapped in an excellent and uniquely South Park adventure.","Fractured But Whole succeeds as an interactive South Park mini-series, while effectively emulating the show's current style of adult-targeted entertainment and satirization of political correctness. In other words, it's consistently amusing and provocative without the edginess the series used to be known for.",,,,,,,,,,,,"While the enhanced battle system is definitely a big step forward, a lot of other elements including the script don’t click as effectively as they did in “The Stick of Truth”. But Coon, Call Girl and Toolshed can be proud to be a part of the “Second best South Park game of all time”.",,,,,"Every aspect is overloaded with both smart and immature jokes, the combat is an improvement, the game is bigger and longer, and the sneaky moments of sincerity make you recall the charm of childhood in surprising ways – just like the show.",,,,"Just like The Stick of Truth, The Fractured But Whole is 100% South Park. This is a must for fans of the show, while those who enjoy a challenging RPG will delight in cranking up the difficulty and working through its many systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As the story progressed and the combat grew deeper, however, I realized that this sequel is an improvement on The Stick of Truth in just about every way. That game gave us our first novel experience of playing through a world that’s virtually indistinguishable from the show, but this sequel is longer, deeper, and more surprising throughout. It may feel like a cavalcade of poop jokes and easy callbacks in the early hours, but the South Park humor and charm shines through more and more as the story progresses.","South Park: The Fractured but Whole has a more polished combat system than the first game, but it still has some of its basic flaws that makes it feel monotonous. Either way, you'll enjoy it the most if you're a fan of the animated show. The plot is intelligent, irreverent and with a few surprises, though it lacks a few epic moments.",,"The Fractured But Whole is a solidly good RPG game that incorporates the South Park attitude with a lot less in-your-face crudeness than The Stick of Truth. It has a better fighting setup, an easier-to- digest storyline, and is still laugh out loud funny at times. What else do you need from a South Park game?","The new South Park game is amazing. Its story is one step behind The Stick of Truth, but overall, the game is fun, entertaining, with a lot of things to do and with a great sense of humour. A must-have for South Park lovers in general.",,,,It's really all that a South Park lover could ask for.,"The new combat mechanics add tons of depth and strategy to the experience, and new exploration abilities really give Fractured But Whole an overall deeper RPG feel. The game is also absolutely hysterical; if you love the humor of South Park in general, then Fractured But Whole is a must have.",,,,,,,,,,,"The Fractured But Whole hits all the right notes from the show’s best episodes. The writing is some of the best you’ll find in a game, and it improves on “The Stick of Truth’s” combat and mechanics enough to make it well worth picking up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In the end South Park: The Fractured But Whole makes me very happy, and I do think farts are funny – at least funny enough for two games.",,,,,,,,,,,"With the great story and new gameplay mechanics its not hard to imagine that the score for this game would have definitely been higher, as the game was good up to where I couldn't progress any further. That being said, since I couldn't fully enjoy South Park: The Fractured But Whole with the bug that stopped me, I'm left feeling mediocre about this game. It's kinda of sad too, as I was enjoying much of what I played, but to have the game 'break', and leave me stranded, is a big letdown, and something that affects how this game scores overall.",,,,,,,,,,,"A fantastic game. While there are some minor flaws, I couldn’t put my controller down. Aside from being one of my personal favorite games of this year, it also holds a special place in my heart as one of the best Ubisoft games I have ever played. If you are a fan of the TV series, as well as The Stick of Truth, I highly recommend purchasing this game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The social commentary in this game is pretty spot on and I got more than my own fair share of laughs, even at my own expense at times as some jokes hit close to home. The fact that this is an RPG that plays really well and has a solid and surprisingly deep battle system is just the icing on the cake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wasteland-3,,"Some small issues aside, Wasteland 3 is a superb RPG and a huge step forward for inXile studio. Wasteland 3 is a classic RPG with great story and characters and challenging but fun combat system that is appealing to both new and old RPG fans.",,,,"Wasteland 3 is overall a great tactical game to play. Add some realism to the game and put yourself in the game, then go off and make your own decisions as you see fit. Aside from the loading times you’re sure to have a great time like I did.",,"It’s certainly one of the more memorable video game experiences this year, and if you have any love for classic RPG’s in general, it should be right up your alley.","Wasteland 3 is a top-notch RPG experience, with an highly compelling turn-based combat system and a well designed multi-path plot. It's not exempt of flaws, mainly in the technical area, and the lack of an Italian localization was quite disappointing, but it's a definitely recommended game.","Wasteland 3 is not a great revolution for the genre or for its franchise itself, but it is one of the main references of an old school of role playing that helped define the foundations that the rest of the proposals have followed since the 80s. There is care and talent in the construction of its world, its stories and its dialogues, as in the rest of the RPG elements, although it is slightly weighed down by a not very striking finish and various technical problems.","Wasteland 3 is an example for future classic role-playing games, and its minor technical flaws do not detract from an outstanding result.","Wasteland 3 feels like it spits in the face the very idea of what a video game is supposed to be in 2020. A carnival of unfiltered violence, relentless and deliciously twisted dark humor, and a sprawling nervous system built of optional narrative branches the vast majority of players may never even see. Wasteland 3 scathingly satirizes the dark underbelly of humanity, while giving you the freedom to embrace the apocalypse or bring hope to a shattered world. This is gaming at its most punk. Raw and unapologetic, but never heartless….This is Wasteland 3, my favorite RPG in years, and quite possibly, my top game of the generation.",,"The story is a corker, bowling along at a fair old lick, and the way it all plays is great, with real tactics needed to win the later combat encounters. Sneaking people into place before getting the drop on a group of enemies never gets old. Add into the mix the multiplayer modes, getting friends in to help with tricky encounters, and the whole package found in Wasteland 3 on Xbox One is a big improvement on the previous game.",,,,,,"Thankfully these issues don’t bring the experience down a great deal though. Wasteland 3 is a meticulously crafted RPG with a world that you’ll truly want to throw yourself into. And if you do, it’s likely to consume a hundred hours of your life, or perhaps even more if you let it. It’s got some brilliant dialogue, plenty of gut-wrenching decisions to make, combat that never becomes a chore, and a character development system that you’ll obsess over. Even if you’ve never dipped your toes into the series before, you should give Wasteland 3 a try. As RPGs go, they don’t get much better than this.",,,"Wasteland 3 is an outstanding RPG. It features a rich world with fun battles, great characters, and plenty of choices to keep you busy for a very long time. This is a best-in-class game that achieves what it sets out to accomplish. Players who opt to take the deep dive into the game’s awesome end-of-the-world landscape are in for something spectacular.",,,"Wasteland 3 is as deep a CRPG as you’re ever likely to play, with meaningful choice and consequence in abundance, if you can get past the frequent crashes and array of irritating bugs.","Wasteland 3, in the field of tactical in general and tactical RPG in particular, will inevitably suffer the comparison with some titles released since Wasteland 2, which proved that one could remain faithful to the spirit of the C-PRG without necessarily lacking a modern and deep approach. However, the old-school character of Wasteland 3 is sure to delight fans of the genre as the baby of InXile knows its lesson and recites it with some enthusiasm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Do you love classic, old-school RPGs? Do you prefer a dirty Apocalypse to a generic fantasy world? Then you’ll love Wasteland 3. We couldn’t have wished for a better successor to the old Fallouts from Interplay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wasteland 3 knows how to open to new players keeping the old school essence.

While the main story is fairly straight forward, how you experience that story is totally in your hands. This is why I can say that Wasteland 3 is one of the best CRPG games you will ever come across. It provides a depth that would allow you a seemingly infinite way to experience the game without being overly complex and hard to manage and all the while not taking itself too seriously in its delivery. If you want a good RPG there are a ton out there that are a dime a dozen, but if you want one of the best CRPG experiences you can have, then you absolutely have to purchase Wasteland 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wasteland 3 is great.

But at the same time Wasteland 3 just can't offer anything we haven't seen before, and myriad of countless technical hiccups is definitely not something we expected to see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fifa-17,"A great story mode and superb presentation, but gameplay clearly lags behind PES. [Dec 2016, p.70]",,FIFA 17 represents the most notorious improvement of the franchise in recent memory. Some areas such as defense tactics and traditional career modes feel a bit neglected this year but on the other hand you have a fresh take on the football experience with The Journey and a complete overhaul of gameplay over the pitch that puts the claim for real innovation to rest... at least this year.,,,,"While it doesn't stack up to PES on the pitch, everything else away from it makes FIFA 17 a worthwhile purchase for fans of the beautiful game.",,"Yet another extremely valid and compelling game in FIFA series, with great variety and a very good story mode. Our primary complaint is about lack of fidelity with many players: what's the point of adding so many of them if visual, animations, and stats fidelity is only accurate in the most popular ones?",,,,,,,,"For all that FIFA promises something for every football fan, from the casual observer to the full-kit fanatic, I still find myself wishing that EA Sports would spend a little more time focusing on the basics. You could probably create the perfect football game by letting Konami handle everything on the pitch, with EA Sports responsible for everything off it. But FIFA plays well enough that the gains elsewhere – in terms of licensing, authenticity, and big-match atmosphere – more than compensate for those shortcomings.","The sports game genre’s toughest task is to make consumers feel a need to buy each year, so an incremental upgrade can often not be quite enough. FIFA 17 was already coming off one of the series’ best outings in awhile, but with features like the The Journey mode and the even more realistic Frostbite engine, EA Canada has once again given players a reason to buy the game yet again with FIFA 17.","FIFA 17 has a lot of strong online activities, some of the best physics in a sports game and a brand new movie-like career. Offline it struggles with a poor AI, but still it's one of the best sports games this year.",,,,"FIFA 17 is visually stunning and ""The Journey"" is a welcome, if imperfect, new mode to the series. The new title is recognizable as a FIFA title, as any long-time fan of the series can attest to, which can be just as negative as it is positive. It's a fun, solid title but one that already has us thinking about what needs to be improved for next year's installment.",,,"Another strong offering from EA Canada, the series' first go with the Frostbite engine has breathed new life into FIFA. Arguably the best one since FIFA 14, FIFA 17 is a positive step in the right direction, despite failing to deliver a game of football that's as responsive, smooth and eminently playable as PES in its prime. That said, FIFA 17 represents a more complete football package in terms of content, delivering unparalleled authenticity with its licenses, commentary and overall presentation.",,,"The Journey is engaging enough that it'll be interesting to see how it's developed next year, but right now, it's not the reason to buy FIFA 17. That remains a combination of still-excellent fundamental gameplay (on a par, at least, with Pro Evolution Soccer 2017's much-improved showing) and Ultimate Team, the game-above-the-game to which PES still has no serious answer. Put together with an improved Career mode and best-in-class presentation, and FIFA 17 is still out in front--even if its lead has been cut this year.",,,,,"FIFA 17, thanks mainly to The Journey, feels like a reintroduction to the things that have made this series EA Sports’ pride and joy for the past eight years. It may be a safe and well-trod story path, but it’s walked with characters I cared about. When I finished The Journey, I beelined for Be a Pro, something I have rarely touched, to create myself there and carry on what I had learned with Alex Hunter.",,,,,,"FIFA 17 moves the whole series a bit further, perhaps thanks to a surprisingly great story mode. But lots of issues still remain, so even though FIFA 17 is the best football from EA of all time, it's still not perfect.",A good soccer game with a cinematic career mode and a lot of enhancements on the pitch. Unfortunately the change to Dice’s Frostbite engine doesn’t pay off yet compared to last years’ Ignite.,,,,,"FIFA's gameplay is on the ascent, but still has some frustrating moments where outcomes are predetermined despite your inputs, as well as occasionally dodgy passes and overpowered keepers. However, the control of your first touch and the increased physical play are assets. The latter is useful whether shielding the ball from an opponent (or vice versa) or trying not to be bossed around on corners.",,,,"FIFA 17 is the biggest stride forward for football this generation. I can’t say it’s reclaimed the crown from PES, and for the players who have made the switch, you’ll still find the controls a little too erratic. But with vastly improved A.I. and more attacking options to complement the defensive backbone, this is the strongest FIFA this generation where it counts.",,,"FIFA 17 has FIFA 16-based gameplay, but it's more polished. It includes a variety of game modes for every taste.","FIFA 17 introduces in football games a thrilling, if limited, journey. All in all is the ""same"" enjoyable and rich game, now visually more polished than ever.","FIFA 17 has pleased us, not only for the graphical overhaul thanks to the new engine, but also for the addition of a story mode and the gameplay improvements made. An excellent soccer game.",,,"There are plenty of improvements in FIFA 17 that will keep franchise fans happy, and the playing time provided by Alex Hunter’s story is almost worth the asking price alone, but the visual evolution has come at a bit of a cost to the gameplay.","FIFA 17 is a great game. The on-pitch action is as realistic as it’s ever been, aesthetically and mechanically, but not without some shortcomings. It’s no longer stagnating like last year’s iteration, but while The Journey is fantastic, Career mode still feels woefully underdeveloped.","FIFA 17 is more or less the same old game again in a new package, but having a campaign in The Journey makes for something fresh, exciting and interesting.",,,,,,"If you're a FIFA 17 fan, go ahead and buy it – you won't regret your purchase. Just be aware that, right now, EA's game can't match the standard of the new console footie king – PES 2017.",,,,"Even if a few additions (on free kicks and corners) won't feel really exciting, FIFA 17 clearly brings the franchise to a higher level with some great gameplay possibilities, great visuals and huge content to keep players coming back.",,,FIFA 17 is a step forward in the series thanks to its new gameplay innovations but specially for the new game mode called The Journey. This new FIFA game feels and plays differently. It's something the fans need.,"Simply put, this is the best FIFA game we’ve seen in years and a superb package that will keep you hooked for months.","The Frostbite engine has allowed FIFA to take the next step in gameplay, with better mechanics and smarter AI to create a bigger challenge. The Journey mode will suck in those wanting a new single player experience while Ultimate Team and Pro Clubs will give all the online players the fix they want. This is a must have for fans of the beautiful game.",,"While the game is amazing at its core, it's beset by infuriating bugs. The Journey shows promise, but drags on too long, becoming a dull grind before it comes to a close. It's a good start for FIFA on its new engine, there are too many kinks that have yet to be worked out.","FIFA 17 is an amazing game. It combines a simulative and refined gameplay to an incredible set of game modes. This year, Ultimate Team is interesting and well-structured, and the career mode is the best offline experience that the genre has to offer. The technical performance is certainly effective, thanks to the new engine.",,,,,"If this is a usual 12 month purchasing decision for you, absolutely no reason to stop now.",,,,"Sure, PES 2017 may once again rule the play through the midfield, but FIFA 17 has so much to offer off the pitch that it’s difficult to not be satisfied. As long as you can get your head around the possession-focused style of play in FIFA, you’ll have no qualms with its gameplay, but it’s everything else that really sells it this year.","Smarter AI and new gameplay make this new FIFA game a very entertaining soccer game with an excellent balance between spectacular and realistic soccer. There are a few minor errors that hold this game back from being an instant classic, but the addition of The Journey, in particular, makes FIFA 17 worth while.","Aside from the missing customization, this is easily the best and most complete FIFA ever. There are other areas with minor issues, but nothing worthy of mentioning in the negatives section. Tightened gameplay, improved visuals and The Journey make this a monumental achievement in the series and it reestablishes the series as the King of the Pitch, yet again.",,,,"FIFA 17 isn't the wind of change we could have expected. In spite of the new Journey mode and the transition to the Frostbite Engine, the game is still fundamentally the same: a simulation with a certain idea of football, attack-minded and individual. And we're becoming sick of it.",,"This season, EA Sports has made a great effort to make its roster bigger than in the previous years. The change of FIFA to PS4 and Xbox One was very conservative, but this year it plays beautifully on the pitch and it shows a great physical form with the Frostbite Engine, The Journey and the exclusive licenses.","Throw in positive tweaks made to Career Mode (the ever-cumbersome transfer network runs itself a bit better than before; there are more objectives that dictate your strategy both in and out of competition), and this is a FIFA game that seems to realize there is competition out there and it has to do a lot more than update the rosters to succeed.",,"FIFA 17 is a great game and without any doubt, is the best chapter of the series on next generation consoles. Frostbite brings brand new physics to the game and the Journey is the first true campaign in the story of FIFA.",,"FIFA 17 is the best next-gen soccer game to date. That's partly because of the new Engine, which performs absolute miracles.","Overall, FIFA 17 performs well and keeps the trophy for football greatness, but it can certainly do better. But with the exclusive licensing and creative game modes, it's tough to beat. However, Pro Evolution Soccer is making great strides in competing against EA's series this year.",,,,"While FIFA 10 and FIFA 13 made huge leaps forward on the gameplay front, FIFA 17 brings it all together. From the world-class presentation to the familiar mechanics, FIFA 17 delivers the most holistic football experience ever.","I liken this year’s football shootout to musicians. In the current season, FIFA is like Madonna – aging but venerable, full of glitz and entertainment value, but ultimately lacking substance. Contrarily, PES is like a fiery independent singer, with minimal flash but much deeper soul where it counts most. In the end, both performers might put a smile on gamers’ faces, but FIFA’s bloat and wrinkles are beginning to show, especially with a younger, hungrier upstart nipping at its heels.","FIFA 17 carries on the good work done by its predecessor, making some changes to the gameplay that make it one of the best games ever into the series. Our expectations for The Journey were a bit higher than the final result, but it's still a good experience.",,"Football has never looked so good, and with a new story mode and some welcome additions to gameplay, EA has got a great football title on their hands.",,"If EA Sports will stay on this path and plans to provide a story next year, this mode should be improved. It's already a great foundation for the future, though not without flaws. Fortunately, the new engine, other, proven and reliable modes, with quick and rewarding gameplay, make this year's FIFA a really good one.",,"Thanks to a new engine and the new mode The Journey FIFA 17 feels brand new. We are glad that the game is still authentic, though it does not really shine. The gameplay can feel a bit slow and it is often frustrating. FIFA 17 is a solid game, but it sure has some rough edges.",,,,,"The impact of changes (new engine, story mode) is not so crucial at the end, especially for the course of matches themselves, but it doesn't change the fact that FIFA 17 is the nicest, funniest and, regarding the content, also the richest game in the whole series. It's just not a revolution. [Issue #268]",,"The story mode is fun, if slightly cliched, and you can simply ignore it if it’s not for you, while Ultimate Team is still as addictive as ever. The slow-paced gameplay and numerous button combinations might irk some people, but get used to it and it’s thoroughly rewarding.",,,,,"FIFA 17 makes gameplay far more realistic than ever before, this is by delivering amazing details and a massive leap in its graphics fidelity in addition to more game modes than ever. It is definitely the ultimate football experience.",,,"The Journey and the Frostbite engine are the two big innovations of FIFA 17. The game is enjoyable in most of the offline modes; conversely, if you are a multiplayer gamer you should beware of the excessive use of skill moves and dribblings from other players, too often decisive in the economy of the matches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"FIFA 17 is a well-rounded product offering up tons of official licenses, several different ways to play, including the intriguing story mode, excellent online features and performance, and gameplay that is accessible and enjoyable. It may feel a little too familiar in some areas, but the additions and improvements that were made have helped to reinvigorate a series which began to stagnate in recent years.","You have to appreciate advancements in the visual department and lots of small but pleasant fixes in the career mode. But FIFA 17 doesn't deserve to be called ""the best virtual football game"". There are too many issues of different kind and this year PES is simply better. FIFA generates fun (as always) but I think the expectations were bigger.",,"Apart from the new graphics engine and some new game modes, FIFA 17 does not innovate and shows itself as a slightly better copy of FIFA 16.

prey,"The aliens don't quite cut it, but Prey offers one of gaming's best settings in years. [July 2017, p.73]",,,,,,"Prey is a game that makes you question what you're seeing with your own eyes. The shooter caters to almost every playstyle by allowing players to extensively customise their character, choose the best course of action and make their own moral judgements. There are surprises hidden in almost every corner and the most rewards are given to players who take the time to explore the large environment that is Talos-1, both through physical rewards and the extra lore that is tucked away through optional interactions. If you prefer games that allow you to run and gun through a linear story then this isn't for you, but if you like to experience a game at your own pace and in your own way, you can't go wrong with Prey.",,"A surprisingly deep game recalling classics like Half-Life and System Shock, with a very compelling story and complex and challenging gameplay that gives great freedom to the player. Some control problems, slightly too long loading times and far from shining graphics keep it from reaching its full potential, but we're definitely facing a new unmissable Arkane Studios gem.","As a whole, Prey is a great game. Difficult to classify, full of choices, with an extraordinary sci-fi setting and most of all, with a marked personality. If you want an excellent adventure, there are so many reasons for not missing this game, such as the huge number of influences underlying it.","Arkane Studios has captured in Prey everything they learned in the previous years with important references such as Bioshock or Dishonored. Prey returns with an wide-open adventure, but one that is equally contained in a closed space, as the Talos I. The gameplay is just a beast in its genre offering multiple options to the player, who will be forced to learn in order to survive in this hostile environment.","Prey might not be the prettiest game, but it's among the most atmospheric. Arkane Studios has proven itself time and time again to be comprised of world-class world builders. Prey is no different. If you're a fan of Dead Space, Deus Ex, or Bioshock, you simply have to buy this game.",,"Prey is what you would expect to find should Bioshock and Dead Space cross paths.

The unsettling sense of paranoia that comes from knowing any object could turn out to be a hidden enemy gives even the quiet moments a palpable tension. All of that picks up the slack for combat and stealth that doesn’t feel fresh enough to sustain it throughout what can be a long game.","Proving that Arkane Studios has no shortage of interesting ideas, Prey is the perfect blend of thrilling action and thought provoking story.",,"Prey expertly blends a compelling narrative with open level design, a fear-inducing mechanic and near-unparalleled player freedom to deliver an appealing, atmospheric and aesthetically pleasing chunk of sci-fi that will get sink its spiky teeth into you and never let go.",,"Coming into this game expecting maybe an above average alien shooter, I was actually really impressed. It has the makings of a BioShock or System Shock while keeping it fresh with new abilities and full exploration to play how I wanted. The horror elements are there and work well, and while the story isn’t the best out there, it is enough to keep people playing. If you’re looking for a new horror game or even a game much like Dishonored where freedom to do what you want is the main crux, Prey is the game for you.",,,,"Prey starts strong, then gets better and better as its compelling narrative gradually unfolds, and new terrors stalk the confines of Talos I. A sci-fi survival masterclass, Prey is quite simply sublime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite those rough patches, Prey is wholly engrossing, begging the player to solve Talos 1’s many mysteries. It works well as a shooter, a stealth game and carries an 70s sci-fi vibe that is nothing short of a delight to experience.",,"Prey has so much gameplay and objectives to accomplish it takes quite a long time to see what all the game has to offer if you choose to do everything. I didn't do every side mission and the game took me around 37 hours to complete. The game is tense and addicting throughout the entire campaign and it's a joy to play. Despite a few shortcoming, it's definitely one of the best games I have played so far this year and I highly recommend it if you're a fan of first person shooter RPGs such as Deus Ex or BioShock.",Prey is a solid gaming experience in which we discover the secrets of the alien DNA investigation committed by TranStar. Its emergent narrative and cohesion between main and secondary missions augur us more than 25 hours of interesting and varied search of the truth aboard the Talos I.,,,,"It’s tempting to go off on one of those tired tangents declaring the setting of Talos 1 as the best-defined character in the game, but while it’s an impressive creation from a clinical design perspective, it’s not exactly spectacular. It’s a space-bound manifestation of corporate banality, a floating office building with all the boring sectors and departments you’d expect from such a thing.",,"Prey is easily one of the best games to come out this year, and I highly recommend picking it up if you’re a fan of BioShock or Dishonored. Arkane skillfully wove together a cohesive narrative, engaging gameplay elements, and a vast environment open to the player. Talos I is an incredible achievement in design and the world of Prey is as intriguing as it is chilling. Its performance issues can be bothersome but aren't a huge detriment to an otherwise excellent game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Prey is simply exceptional. The story is twisting and confusing in a way that is exciting, and it makes you crave the next scene. The survival-horror approach to combat and gameplay creates the right amount of tension, while the crafting elements and ability to use almost anything in the world allows for emergent solutions thanks to the different approaches to almost every situation. Most of the flaws are technical in nature, and they're not enough to severely impact the game, so Prey earns its place as one of the hallmarks of this platform generation.",,"Despite its issues, Prey is an enjoyable first-person shooter which begs you to explore its wonderfully crafted and at times awe-inspiring world.","Everything Prey needed to succeed is in there, somewhere, but it doesn't gel. The game is too undefined, too broad in its ambition and application of its powers, spaces and weapons, that it fails to find and carve out its own identity. [Issue#188, p.69]",,,,,,,,,,,,"Prey really wants to be the strange science fiction cousin to Dishonored, with varied combat and deep world building. Arkane Studios has really succeeded with the latter. It's easy to tolerate the lackluster combat when Talos 1 is such a fascinating place to visit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Prey, despite all the faults and setbacks I have noted, is actually a quality game from start to finish. It has plenty of content that will keep you air locked in for hours on end, and given the faults, you'll be spending so much time exploring that you may not even regard them as faults at all. After 10 years the gaming world was ready for another Prey, and Arkane Studios was up for the challenge and they succeeded more than they failed. Prey does deliver a sound introduction to an IP that has seen a troubled development process, and yes even though there are some drawbacks, there is a tremendous foundation for an incredible future. Do I think Prey could be game of the year? No. Do I think Arkane Studios could make Prey into an amazing gaming series? Yes.",,,,"Prey is a one of a kind experience which has a huge world, a thrilling story and very rich content.

gears-5,"Gears 5 is definitely a success story... it’s just not quite on the same Xbox tier of insta-classic territory as the original Gears Of War. Though combat is satisfying, there’s the nagging doubt it hasn’t evolved enough over the past 13 years – a point hammered home if you play Remedy’s recent Control. Still, despite some overly safe online modes, that refreshed, never-bolder campaign makes Kait’s story a tour of duty you should definitely sign up for. [Issue#183, p.69]","Gears 5 tries to bombard players with tons of content and offers many days of entertainment as it aims to introduce itself as a true AAA+ game. The result is a very entertaining game, but is that enough to justify Microsoft's flagship? Not sure. Maybe the only aspect that Gears 5 really shines in is visuals, and while everything else is also okay, we expect a lot more than that from a title like Gears of War.",After many doubts - which at this point seem ridiculous and unjustified - Gears 5 shows why Gears of War is one of the most beloved franchises in the industry. It is a fantastic game that dared to change so that the franchise reaches the heights it deserves.,,"The gameplay while familiar has been tweaked and the level design is easily one of the best created worlds on a console, especially seeing it on 4K on the Xbox One X.","I can say with absolute certainty that Gears 5 is an astonishingly fun video game. The excellent flow of combat established in prior entries has been implemented here almost flawlessly, the audio/visual feedback is intense, and there’s even a compelling, touching narrative in there to boot. The open world areas let the pace down a bit, and some difficulty spikes can frustrate, but overall if you’re after an action experience, you cannot go wrong here.",,,"With its greatly improved Campaign, many multiplayer modes and customization options, Gears 5 is the most varied, complete and deep experience ever for the franchise. The Coalition managed to improve the game adding many new ingredients, yet keeping it faithful to its origins, and with an astounding technical implementation. A game every Xbox owner should definitely play.","Gears 5 is the best Gears of War to date, with a proposal that has been supported by 5 equally treated game modes with lots of content. The campaign is spectacular, emotional and fun to play while each multiplayer mode (cooperative or versus) has its own nuances and provides a different proposal. This is one of the best games of 2019.",Gears 5 is perfect as a new Gears and one of the best action titles of this generation. You can't ask for more quality content in one game.,"The fact that Gears 5 manages to jam a truly ""AAA"" 12-18 hour campaign, several multiplayer modes, a map editor, and the promise of post-launch support represents one of the best deals in gaming right now. It's an even better value when you factor in Xbox Game Pass. The future of Gears of War has never been so bright — and sure, there's room for improvement, but this is the evolution that the franchise desperately needed.","I played the first Gears of War, and right now, Gears 5 has barely changed the flavour of the original. And while the original might have been a revelation, Gears 5 presents as a detriment.","I have no hesitation in naming Gears 5 on Xbox One as a triumph. The story is amazing, the multiplayer works perfectly, and Horde and Escape are the cherries on the cake.",,"Gears 5 doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it changes enough to keep its signature style of cover-based shooting from feeling monotonous. Going into this review, I was convinced Gears of War needed to change drastically or risk obsolescence. But the Coalition has found a different way forward, using new mechanics to polish the old, making the whole game shine.","What was unexpected is just how effectively it doubles down on story with a character-focused, consequence-filled tale that plays to one of the franchise’s most underappreciated strengths and backs it up with fun, welcome additions to both its gameplay formula and flow. And that’s just the campaign: add in a heavy-hitting multiplayer lineup of Versus, Versus Arcade, Horde, and Escape and it makes Gears 5 one of the best and most versatile action-game packages in recent memory.","Gears 5 once again feels like a safe bet by The Coalition. You can start to see the developer thinking about new ideas and potential directions that the series can go, but Gears 5 feels largely familiar. The additions of some new features and a new mode added to the fan-favorites that return make for a robust package though.","It's time to give a verdict, and Gears 5 is not simply one of the best titles of this generation. It's also one of the best chapters of the series. It fully captures the spirit of the brand and expands its formula, bringing it to its maximum expression. Rod Fergusson, TheCoalition, congratulations, you did it.",,"Gears 5 is an impressive evolution in the Gears of War series with a campaign that feels like a huge leap forward and a dizzying amount of excellent multiplayer modes. The story isn’t without its issues, especially the final act which I’m sure will draw controversy, but that does little to hold back this awesome next chapter in the Gears saga.","Gears 5 is incredible, a true renaissance for the series. The changes made to campaign are exactly what I wanted the series to be. The multiplayer suite has something for everyone. This is just an incredible package that deserves its praises.","It’s unfortunate that Gears 5 continues the trend of ‘games that were clearly shipped before they were ready’ since its diverse offering of different gameplay experiences is virtually unmatched by any other shooter game or franchise. Once The Coalition has ironed out the campaign performance issues and multiplayer network problems, this latest Gears of War game has a very bright future and is a must-play for any fans of the shooter genre no matter their individual tastes.",,,"Once again, The Coalition proves itself as Gears of War's ideal custodian. Gears 5 is one of the best entries in the series yet, delivering an unrivalled package that still boasts the best headshots in the business.","One of the most technically impressive games available on any consoles, Gears 5 tries new stuff and does it so well. Definitly one of the best Xbox One games ever, period.","With gratifying combat, practically unmatched visual grandeur, a new focus on exploration and some of the most interesting locations and characters at the high-budget end of modern gaming, Gears 5 is an incredible leap forward for the original cover-based third-person shooter series.","Gears 5 is very much a return of those best elements of Gears of War, but with a focus on making the game feel somewhat more adaptive to your particular ways of playing. Whether you want campaign or co-op, Competitive or Quickplay, there's an option for you in Gears 5, and plenty of stuff to reward you for time spent and skill gained. Gears 5 might suffer from some of the same storytelling missteps as its predecessors, and it might not venture far out of the past, but the new ideas it brings to the series are all good reasons for fans to return.","The Coalition has slightly fiddled with the formula, and whilst some adjustments need to be refined for future entries, Gears 5 is ultimately the gorgeous third-person shooter you want it to be.",,"Gears 5 offers a familiar action experience that should satisfy fans who gravitate towards its expanded multiplayer options. And yet, the uneven campaign and lack of significant gameplay innovations mean this latest chapter does little to draw in the uninitiated.",,"Gears 5 is personal, like its predecessor, and insistent in focusing on its characters. It’s thoughtful, and unafraid to stop the action in favor of slower story beats and sections focused on exploration. And those are the parts that I enjoyed the most. There’s often a little dab of fighting, followed by a light dusting of exploration.",,"Gears 5 is an odd thing; it's neither a grand leap forwards, nor a complete rehash of what came before, and therefore sits somewhere in the middle of the two. On the whole, the improvements do outweigh the negatives (the non-linear approach to campaign levels and the small changes to horde mode being some of the most notable), and while The Coalition still has some work to do to really make the series its own, this is a far bolder and more varied approach the relatively safe Gears 4. If you love shooters and you want a good place to jump back into the series, this is perfect place to work the rust out of your lancer.",,,,"The campaign is certainly better than in Gears 4 and the core gameplay is fun, but Gears 5 is way behind the original trilogy in almost all other aspects - especially due to the incessant, and boring, lulls in the action.","Gears 5 delivers an entertaining campaign with surprisingly open areas, excellent visuals and a bunch of fun (and sometimes fresh) multiplayer modes. But it also suffers from technical glitches and bugs.",,,"Combat remains exquisitely satisfying, the sound and visual departments have upped their game, the multiplayer is once more highly addicting and the lore of the world has never been so compelling. Gears 5 doesn’t quite reinvent the genre, but instead acts as a stepping stone for a better future.",,"Gears 5 is exactly what it needs to be. This old war vet still packs a punch. The open-world exploration has issues, but that isn’t enough to steal away the thunder The Coalition expertly deploys on the battlefield. The campaign is a fun ride that concludes with a shocker moment and a hell of a setup for a sequel. I’m already looking forward to that follow-up.","The attempts to innovate in terms of storytelling and structure feel superficial and ineffective, leaving Gears 5 to survive purely on its increasingly overfamiliar action.","By most metrics — polish, graphics, writing, acting and engaging game play mechanics — Gears 5 is an impressive product for both solo players and competitive or cooperative shooter fans. But moving forward, the series desperately needs to venture into new ways of telling its stories and pacing its encounters. The tentative toe-dip into open world design is a great start, but not enough. Gears 5’s campaign is robust and almost always fun and its focus on the female protagonist Kait is a welcome tonal and dramatic shift, though it doesn’t much impact the gameplay. I’m always ready to dive into a new Gears game but I’m hoping next time, The Coalition will take some bold chances, make some tough choices and steer the series in a really new direction.","Gears 5 is a big, loud blockbuster that brings so much to the table, it’s easy to under-appreciate it. By building on the stories set in motion by its predecessor, Gears 5’s narrative journey is a benchmark for the series so far with well-rounded characters that are far easier to love when compared to the original trilogy’s gruff, motley crew. Once you throw a polished, brutally competitive online facet, Horde’s best iteration and the promising Escape into the mix, Gears 5 becomes a package too hard to refuse considering the clear value on offer. The story’s driving force might be “bound by blood” but Gears 5 is bound for greatness.",Campaign was sold as an open-world vehicle for Kait and that takes a bit of time to actually be upheld; trust me though: it's worth the wait.,"The developer has done an admirable job of maintaining the core of Epic Games' legacy, yet they have been unable to truly improve upon it. It is still the same cover-shooting action it has always been. Still satisfying and very crunchy.",,"An outstanding game that offers more and better in every aspect of it, making Gears 5 one of the biggest first party games ever released on an Xbox console.","Gears 5 is still the same game it has always been, but in Katie it finds a fresh, new character with a more intriguing story.","Gears couldn’t age any better. This fifth main entry polishes its gameplay to perfection and delivers a great campaign and a fantastic multiplayer full of content. It also takes more risks than its predecessor, and even if sometimes the result has some room for improvement, overall it’s a game that has surpassed our expectations.","By the time we skipped the credits, both of us agreed that Microsoft’s internal studio had created a knock-out experience that stands in flattering contrast to many of today’s big budget shooters.",,,,,,,"Gears 5 is a return to form for the venerable series, and though some new ideas and better writing aren’t quite executed to perfection, they bring a welcome sense of freshness to a series where the fundamentals are as strong as ever.",,"Gears 5 is pretty damn good, huh? A campaign that dares to revitalize the series' formula, backed up by some classic multiplayer, Horde Mode, and all that nonsense. It's real good. It's gorgeous to boot, with great lighting, meaty effects, and an icy new environment with all the snowy fun it entails. I'm tired. I was up all night playing Gears 5. So tired.","Between breathtaking cinematics, slow-paced exploration and blood-soaked gunfights, Gears 5 manages to scratch several gaming itches all at once, without becoming tedious and raw on the skin.",It makes for a relentlessly entertaining and often heart-thumpingly thrilling campaign that would be easy enough to recommend on its own.,,,"Gears 5 is both a very generous and welcoming game. Building on what made the Gears franchise a power house, The Coalition changed the campaign's structure, added useful features to Horde mode, created a fun new coop mode and made the game more accessible for people with disabilities and new players. And it doesn't hurt that the game is really pretty (especially on the Xbox One X) Gears 5 is only being dragged down a bit by a couple technical issues that shouldn't be seen in AAA first party games.",Gears 5 survives on its solid cover shooting gameplay and a campaign that isn't afraid to pose difficult questions about problematic topics. But the largely stagnant Horde mode and general mess of an Escape mode really pull the sequel back from being a bold step forward.,"The game looks really great and has a deliberately brighter and more varied color palette than most of the previous games. While I think the open-world stuff is flat and could have been way better, there are moments out there in the nothingness that just look straight-up incredible, including a late-game weather sequence that, despite not being great gameplay, was worth seeing a couple of times just for the visuals alone.",Gears is finally back with its fifth major game. The Coalition did a wonderful job making the Gears game all the fans deserve.,,,"Gears 5 proves the value of a talented team such as The Coalition. Almost every experience through the game feels that they chose the right decision in terms of gameplay, but fails in the purpose of open world. Here we can find a multiplayer and coop experience, with horde and escape, created to be played over the long term.","There are missteps, especially with the open worlds feeling lifeless, but Gears 5 is a more confident turn from a developer that no longer has to prove it’s capable of making a faithful Gears of War sequel. Bigger, better and more beautiful – and a bold step in the right direction for the series. The action is superlative, the writing hits humorous and emotional notes, and the number of multiplayer modes is extensive. If ever there was a reason to subscribe to Xbox's Game Pass service, this is it.","Gears 5 is a very solid chapter of one of the cornerstones of gaming in Xbox format: an episode that proudly reaffirms the vigorous soul of Lancer's armed fighters and the talent of a studio like The Coalition, stopping just a step away from absolute excellence.","Gears 5 is The Coalition's best Gears of War game so far, and it's because it's a brave and bold iteration of one of the biggest franchises in the shooter genre.","The Coalition has achieved a lot with Gears 5. The writing and action often rivals the best moments in the series, even surpassing its predecessors at times. The overall package is the most robust Gears has ever seen. But, the big structural alteration feels like an unequivocal misstep. Gears 5 is a rousing success, but it could've done without the needless change.","Gears 5 makes major strides in the series’ approach to storytelling. This is the most heartfelt Delta Squad has ever been, and The Coalition backs up that emotion with genuine improvements to gameplay. While its new co-op mode, Escape, is generally underwhelming, Arcade mixes up the competitive meta enough to keep things interesting. All told, Gears 5 is more Gears, but it’s also a bold statement for why this series is still relevant.",,,"As a multiplayer experience, Gears 5 offers up a wide variety of options, and something is sure to please almost every type of player. There are some rough edges, especially with the way character upgrades are handled, but the core gameplay is solid and satisfying. Combined with the campaign, Microsoft and the Coalition have given players an amazing value, especially if you are getting the title via Game Pass. It may not be perfect, but it'll provide hours of fun, and that's what matters.","There's a lot going on here, much of it captivating, some of it just for appearances and some of it annoying. [Issue#338, p.92]",,,"For the first time in forever, Gears 5 is successfully performing a new trick. Thanks to the light rpg elements, fights are a lot more diverse and fun, while the story and the characters bring out a previously hidden human side.",,"Gears 5 is a brilliant experience which can be enjoyed alone or with friends in equal measure. It keeps much of the series' core gameplay and feel, but also takes it in some new directions. It's great to see Gears evolving, opening the door for even more positive changes in the future.","With Gears 5, The Coalition took some risks, and it makes for one of the best entries in the series yet.",,,"After the slightly disappointing Gears of War 4, Gears 5 shows that the series is back with a vengeance, with what is the best Gears of War game yet.","Gears 5 takes a step forward in all aspects, with a campaign with open levels, but still very intense. Audiovisually it's a delight and the multiplayer expands with new more approachable modes and a renewed horde mode with hero shooter features. The best Microsoft Studios game in recent years.","The resounding theme of Gears 5 seems to be marrying old with new. There’s never any mistaking it for something other than a Gears game, thanks to its polished cover-based combat mechanics, gleefully gory action, and 4K, HDR-enhanced graphics that raise the bar of what we can expect from an Xbox One game. But it’s also trying to grow the Gears experience by focusing on new characters, altering the flow of the campaign, and adding daring new multiplayer modes.",,"Gears 5 is the natural evolution of the Gears series: a more daring game, in every possible way. The Campaign took us by surprise, not only with its narration, but also with its bold design choices. The single-player experience prepares the player for a second round, with the gargantuan multiplayer section, where we find the glorious old modes and an Escape mode that punished and seduced us.","With great graphics, a surprisingly decent story and meaty battles with an extra tactical layer thanks to Jack the flying robot, Gears 5 surprises us a whole lot. We were skeptical at first, but The Coalition has managed to outshine Epic’s Gears of War titles in most ways. Just beware of all the bugs.","Gears 5 offers up an amazing campaign that isn't afraid to take risks, while staying true to its core. The new Escape mode is great, just like the additions to the iconic Horde mode. It's a shame the game suffers from many technical problems.",,,"Gears 5, like almost all its predecessors, is an absolutely great action game that has not only technical class, but the The familiar Gears mechanism is so finely honed that I've had so much fun at the cover-up ball games as I've rarely done before.",,"On the whole, Gears 5 is one of the most content-packed titles around. If you’re somebody, you’re probably going to find something up your alley here. Revolutionary? No. The structure is very familiar, and there are bugs here and there, but this is an ambitious package that’s polished in almost every way. No matter what your experience level is with these familiar faces, Gears 5 is the most accessible title in the line, and is ultimately successful in trying to be something for everyone.",,"Gears 5 brings the series to new heights, thanks to a well-directed campaign with an open world approach, some interesting new gameplay mechanics and many multiplayer modes that combine old and fresh elements.",,"If you didn’t think you needed another Gears of War, you were wrong. Gears 5 is a barnstorming success, and a triumphant return for the series. This is the essential first party game the Xbox One desperately needed.",,,"The Gears 5 singleplayer is better than any in the Gears of War series has ever been, with a stunningly beautiful, spectacular and (emotionally) satisfying campaign. Too bad the multiplayer part of the game hasn't been improved as much, making it only a slight disappointment. But on a whole this is a seriously fun and complete rated M for Mature shooter package.","With Gears of War 4, The Coalition demonstrated the essence of Gears, but with Gears 5 the developer finally dares to take steps forward. It's the impactful campaign that makes Gears 5 a strong game.",,,"At the end of Gears 4, Kait receives her grandmother's necklace from her dying mother. On that necklace is a Locust Horde symbol, and clearly there's some sort of strange connection between Kait and the Locust Horde. The way Gears 5 explores this is brilliant. It's inventive, it's surprising, and the method of delivery is wrapped up in a scary and enticing series of events that is delightfully gripping.",,"Gears 5 offers a solid portion of brutal action with several refreshing new things. If you have intentionally avoided games from this series, the fifth sequel probably won´t change your mind, but if you are looking for a quality action game and you are still a fan of multiplayer, try it. [Issue#298]",,"Gears 5 is the series' most ambitious entry to date, bringing with it an endless wave of revolutionary ideas that the franchise has been in desperate need of for years. The Coalition's mark has finally been made, and it's one that focuses on narrative importance alongside bright, energetic mechanics that show that Gears 5 can happily stand alongside this generation's other blockbusters without fear.","It’s been a long time since I’ve had Gears on the brain, and now that Gears 5 has been extremely addictive and taking a large chunk of my time lately, I’m glad to say that not only is Gears back, but better than ever with a slew of additions, changes and improvements. Kudos to The Coalition for taking the risks they did. I’m no longer worried that one of my most beloved franchises are in safe hands going forward.","Gears 5 is a sequel that delivers on everything I was hoping Gears of War 4 would be. It’s the same tried and true gameplay loop, but with more console power juicing it up and a few new gadgets, weapons and tools to play around with. The open world stuff is sort of boring, but it’s at least nice to look at, and the co-op experience being so well integrated makes up for it (minus the dreadful, illegible UI). There’s much more ambition and creativity in its storytelling and more competent writing from a mechanical standpoint. Combined with a clean, user-friendly multiplayer suite that even finds time to add brand new ways to play, Gears 5 is a standout even among its own series. It’s rough around the edges, but in a good way.",Gears 5 has a solid single-player campaign which is full of interesting ideas and a brand new PVE mode. It might be a breakthrough for the franchise if it keeps providing high-quality multiplayer content in the future.,"Gears has had its ups and its downs, and thankfully, Gears 5 does a good job of lifting the series back up. Its improved focus on characters and more open areas really helps to strengthen the campaign, and the multiplayer offers the same over-the-top action you've come to expect. It won’t likely bring in many new converts, but if you’re a fan who’s felt alienated by more recent entries, Gears 5 is a great place to jump back in.","Gears 5 adds some welcome additions to the formula and presents a compelling story that teases an epic climax, although its high time that we see a new Gears formula with the next instalment.","Gears 5 has a lot to offer, with multiplayer, co-op modes, and a single-player campaign with wide range of emotions, from humor and laughter to despair and tragedy. It leaves the fans with a bit of a cliffhanger ending, but that just means that fans will want Gears 6 to come soon.",,,"Gears 5 is the best Gears of War game so far as it features one thrilling campaign and plenty of exciting online multiplayer modes. In fact, it's so much fun that I highly recommend playing it if you're not already a Gears fan so you can see what the series is capable of.",,"Gears of War 4 saw The Coalition faithfully tracing from the established Gears of War formula. Gears 5, on the other hand, shows the studio is ready to draw. A more engaging and emotional campaign introduces features we hope to see in all subsequent games, and the addition of Escape gives more aggressive players more reasons to keep coming back. Though Horde mode’s different upgrades can get a little unwieldy and we could do without the microtransactions, this is the best version of Gears of War we’ve played in years.",Gears 5 is perhaps the best entry in the long-running shooter series and stands as one of the best games of the Xbox One era.,"It’s a strong campaign, then, and one made better when you play with friends – as is always the way – and the suite of features that accompany it will likely keep you busy for some time.",,,,,,,"Though a tad slow to get going, Gears 5 has reinvented itself in ways many of us didn't dare dream was possible, blending what we loved about the franchise with a fresh story, personable protagonists, and some of the best visuals and shooting mechanics we've seen.","Gears 5 gives a lot of content for players to chew on. The campaign is by far the best part of this meal because of the deep character-driven story and the bombshell decision made near the end of the game. Multiplayer fans will not be disappointed with the updated versions of Horde and Versus. On the other hand, Escape feels out of place, but still brings fun and intuitive map building.",,,"Gears 5 is simply a very good game, tailored for the fans of the series. The new installment works great regardless of whether you play alone, or in coop, as well as during multiplayer battles. Sure, maybe it's not very inventive and rather similar to previous GoWs, but in this case, it's a great recommendation.",,Gears 5 has become the biggest reference in Xbox One: The Coalition has managed to understand the roots of the franchise in order to create an excellent game that perfectly represents the IP and everything it stands for. We start saying goodbye to the current generation with an incredible game thanks to all of the new options added to both the story mode and the multiplayer.,,"Gears 5 has the worst single player campaign in the series so far. However, the multiplayer is still excellent.",,"Gears 5 is a beautiful balancing act of new and old, and it manages to offer the franchise’s trademark action and gore while telling a compelling story that sets up the future of the series in a big way.",,,,,,"Gears 5 is a return to form for Microsoft’s hardcore series, delivering fans the roadie-running, head-bursting, visceral joy that made the franchise such a success in the first place. A few odd design choices can’t dull the sheen of what is a well-produced, well-optimised and truly beautiful piece of brutal, bloody good fun. Gears 5 is well worth a play for anyone that owns Xbox Games Pass, and absolutely worth consideration for anyone that wants to own one of the best Xbox One exclusives of a generation.",,"Gears 5 proposes a breathtaking solo campaign and a generous array of multiplayer modes. Even if the recipe remains classic, we really want to go through with it. The characters are rather well written, the environments are often spectacular, and Jack the robot adds some salt to the gameplay. A visual feast and glorious action game that perfectly demonstrate Xbox One X's true power.",,,"Despite dropping “of War” from its title, Gears 5 is the first time the series has made the brutality of its combat feel not only bloody and cathartic, but also captivating and disturbingly intimate on a human level.",,Mixed multiplayer and a depressing grind can't dim the light of a superb new Gears campaign. [Eurogamer Recommended],"The creative team for this series has changed a lot since its beginnings. The world around Gears has changed, too. Gears 5 seems like a reflection of those changes. It’s a game that further complicates its world and stars a more complex hero. It’s still a game with a chainsaw gun, but now, those chainsaw guns can have a grenade launcher attached. Sometimes, change is good.",,,,,,,,,,,,"I can’t imagine anyone walking away from Gears 5 disappointed. This is a complete package, tied together with some of the most consistently engaging gameplay you could ask for. The storytelling on display proves that the franchise has yet to peak, and it lays the foundation to continue improving with whatever comes next.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s just sort of fine. Gears looks, sounds and clearly wants so desperately to be what we hoped it would be. But it also never finds a narrative focus to pin everything onto, and it feels very much like every Gears game that has come before it.

Whether you go for single-player, multiplayer or horde mode, GoW4 hast plenty to offer. The visuals are stunning and the gameplay is the best in the series thus far; and despite shortcomings in the story and development of characters, GoW4 is easily one of the best third-person shooters of this generation.","Gears of War 4 delivers a solid entertainment experience. Supported by a great multiplayer and cooperative modes as well as an amazing campaign, the game only falls short on its script and character development. Horde 3.0 is awesome and deep, the new multiplayer modes are fun and the history feels like a 3D Contra game. Leaving other minor technical setbacks aside, Xbox One users can't go wrong with this one.",,"Gears of Wars is back and new developers The Coalition not only pay homage to what came before but enhance the experience. Sure, the mechanics are almost identical to the previous games but with new executions, vehicles, defense building plus new enemies/weapons and you have everything you need for a great Gears of War 4 experience!",,"While the gameplay and storyline certainly aren't lacking and will likely keep Gears fans amused, The Coalition seems reluctant to let the past go and to move on. Away from the campaign, there are tweaks to competitive multiplayer that include a couple of new game modes, but the real focus of the title is the improved Horde mode.","I think it’s safe to say the franchise is in the right hands, and I look forward to seeing more from both the developer and this series in the years to come.","A GoW game made for GoW lovers: it manages to successfully leverage all of the series strengths with a convincing story and a new cast of characters, awesome graphics and a contents-packed multiplayer, even if they're not trying to innovate the series.",,,"Gears of War 4 just feels great. It feels like the return of an old friend, and The Coalition masterfully weave that nostalgia into the game without smothering us in it exploitatively — which is something they very easily could have done. Gears of War 4's greatest moments can be found in between the lines. They're in the shadows of familiar silhouettes, in the tones of nostalgic sound effects, in every COG tag you find scattered around the battlefield, and every ridiculous, over-the-top set piece.","While not as immediately memorable as Gears 1, Gears of War 4 does a similar job to J.J. Abrams’ Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens -- it takes positive and familiar themes from the first game and dresses them up in modernity and pretends it’s an entirely new, and fresh start. So it’s not bad, but it’s not groundbreaking either.",,,"Gears of War 4 is a focused, confident exercise in how to relaunch a franchise. As effective as a direct sequel as it is a soft-reboot, it’s a game crafted of thought, wisdom, and objective calculation blended with a real passion for finding the fun. It may err slightly on the safe side in its campaign, but it does so understandably, in order to strip the series back to what matters, and re-evolve it with a carefully considered outlook.","I never expected to compare Gears of War 4 to The Force Awakens, but I couldn’t be happier to do so. Like the latest chapter in the story from a time long ago in a galaxy far, far away, Gears of War 4 is directed by a new generation of creators, shares a lot of similar narrative structures to the beloved first piece of the trilogy it succeeds, and is an experience you’ll walk away from with a big smile on your face.","Gears of War 4 is exactly what you've come to expect a Gears of War game to be over the years -- an impressive visual showcase in the campaign, with the accompanying competitive and cooperative modes to keep you busy long after the credits roll. Its good to finally see a new Gears of War game on the Xbox One. The wait has been long for Gears of War 4, and now we've seen that the wait has been worth it.",,"Gears of War 4 is a triumphant return to form for the series. What’s more, it proves that the franchise is more than safe in the hands of The Coalition. A visual spectacle that dials back some of the macho ridiculousness of the original trilogy whilst refining and expanding the gameplay, it’s genuinely a game to own an Xbox One for.","Gears of War 4 also has the most stunning presentation we’ve seen in any Gears game. For the first time in the series, characters look more photorealistic than they do cartoonish, and the environment is alive with insane weather, deep darkness, and particle effects that are truly stunning.",,"It’s difficult to fault The Coalition for not running with new ideas when it comes to Gears of War 4. The game definitely feels like a Gears of War title, but it’s more of a revamped reboot rather than a proper sequel. If you’ve been a fan of previous Gears titles, there’s a lot to like about Gears of War 4, but for anyone who wasn’t already sold on the series, don’t expect anything here to suddenly change your mind.",,"With an interesting, albeit familiar narrative, great gameplay and some really brutal battles, Gears of War 4 offers exactly what fans of the series have been yearning for: hours upon hours of great, weighty combat.","A cracking first effort from The Coalition, Gears of War 4 might be the studio playing it safe for its first proper go around with Gears, but it successfully manages to retain everything that's special about the series while re-igniting mankind's struggle for survival on Sera. That means there will be sequels. Lots of sequels. Fortunately, Gears of War 4 is a superb game, so if they're anything like this, bring 'em on.",,,"Gears of War 4 makes the best of the franchise's multiplayer modes, but delivers a lackluster campaign in the process.","And any game that features characters who perform one-arm pullups to go up ladders is automatically in my good books. Gears of War 4 features such characters. There's no doubt that the long-term appeal of Gears 4 lies in its suite of multiplayer modes, but I would 100 per cent recommend playing through the campaign. It's some of the best fun I've had in a shooter for quite some time.",,,"It’s the ideal handoff title, delivering the franchise from the last generation of stars to a new cast, and powering the franchise into a new era. And it does all this without ever compromising the soul of the series, maintaining the pace and rhythm of the franchise to a tee.","Taken all together, Gears of War 4 doesn’t completely reinvent the genre, and it’s not always ""bigger."" But it’s a remarkably consistent, complete package with the kind of refinement and focus few other games can manage, providing excellent solo, cooperative, and competitive options that rank it as one of the best action games of 2016.",,,"The multiplayer mode is still excellent but I can’t stand how much this game as a whole is stuck in the previous generation both in terms of design and form. [12/2016, p.62]","The campaign leans on everything that worked in the first game, all while adding new flourishes to further make the world of Gears of War more compelling. The multiplayer is as enjoyable as ever, with the new modes keeping Gears online elements fresh, and more importantly, addictive. It's undeniably good to be thumping around in COG armor again.",,"Although the old dog didn’t learn many new tricks, at least not in campaign, the old dog is still a determined fighter who can put up a fight. Rock-solid campaign can be compared to the previous episodes without any shame, plus there is a great multiplayer mode - especially Horde 3.0 mode, in which you can spend dozens of hours and still experience something new.","Enthusiasm and disappointment go hand in hand with Gears of War 4. While the campaign lacks the punch that you are used to from the 360-classics, the enhanced multiplayer gives you almost everything you can dream of.","Gears of War 4 may adhere to a seemingly old-fashioned template but, in practice, it feels anything but archaic. Its single-player campaign is much more varied and engaging than those of its predecessors and the online mode is exhilarating, catering for all shades of gamers, from the less adept to those with pro-gamer aspirations. The horde thoroughly deserves its 3.0 designation upgrade and as a whole, the fourth iteration gives the Gears of War template the rejuvenating shot in the arm it sorely needed.",,"Don’t go into Gears of War 4 expecting a thought provoking story; go into it for its action packed scenarios, superb multiplayer experience and top tier shooting mechanics.",,"Even with a new studio leading the development charge, Gears of War 4 is a return to form for the series, and is continual delight, even if it does unnecessarily cling for dear life to the past.","The story campaign can be a little bland, at least when playing on your own, but otherwise this does a fine job of bringing Gears into the current gen.","Gears of War 4 is one of the most visually impressive games on the Xbox One, period (and yes, I am one of those who think that graphics matter). While the combat is familiar, it is also fine-tuned and polished for maximum challenge and enjoyment, whether in the multiplayer modes, or plowing through the campaign alone.",,"The Coalition’s multiplayer offerings make up for an inconsistent campaign in Gears of War 4. Even then, and as much as I hate to admit it, what’s been presented has me eager for more – even though I would have preferred some resolution in this title, thank you very much. Gears fans will love it and newcomers should find enough to get them geared up – pun intended – for more.",,,The Coalition has made a proper Gears of War. GoW 4 has a new setting and enemies but everything else there is what made this franchise an instant classic on Xbox. One of the best TPS out there on Xbox One or PC.,"Gears of War is back with a very solid entry in the beloved franchise: the lack of courage and the apparent fear of taking risks prevents Gears of War 4 from entering the absolute elites of the genre, yet with its compelling campaign and the usual, stellar multiplayer, this remains one hell of a ride.",GOW4 fits perfectly as a fourth episode. It keeps the same core of the franchise and expands it with good new ideas in every aspect of the game.,This is still a franchise about muscle-bound men and alpha women using machine guns fixed with chainsaws to eviscerate battalions of antagonists. But I love it unlike any other big-budget shooter series.,,"Gears of War 4 is a solid and fun, if overly familiar, entry in the beloved cover-shooter franchise. Veterans will feel right at home, and newcomers will feel welcome.","Gears of War 4 is a great game which is let down by its campaign to some degree due to the unanswered questions. However, the ending teases a massive surprise and you’ll be shocked as to the direction the game is heading in.",Gears of War 4 builds on the design we learned to love during the last generation. The result? Another great game in the series.,,"Gears of War 4 is a return to form for the franchise. The campaign plays it pretty safe, but a near-perfect pacing and outstanding variety of gameplay make for an entertaining experience that is best enjoyed with a friend.",,"Gears 4 gives me the same sense of wonder and excitement playing through the campaign as I first had with Marcus and Dom a decade ago. It is a 'Gears' for a new generation, and The Coalition has risen to the occasion to give a top notch package with heaps of production and replay value both. The Ultimate Edition specifically is not worth its hefty price tag, but Gears of War 4 itself should not be missed.","The campaign is flimsy, and despite claims of signifying a new generation for the series, Gears of War 4 is ultimately an upholder of the status quo.","The multiplayer stuff seems as strong or even stronger while the visuals are absolutely stunning. It's not the blockbuster restart you might have hoped for, but there's enough good stuff here to make you hope The Coalition gets another run.","Its thrilling, opulent campaign is tempered only by a lingering sense of familiarity and hesitation to capitalise on some interesting new ideas. While its online offerings feature all the bells and whistles you would expect of Gears of War. There is some work to be done for The Coalition to make Gears their own, then, but as the first page of a new chapter for the series? It is a helluva place to start.",,,Gears of War fans can finally breathe a sigh of relief: Gears of War 4 is truly a worthy sequel to the first trilogy. The Coalition managed to create a game that is both faithful to what made Gears Gears all the while adding new gameplay ideas and expanding the GoW mythos.,"The Gears of War series returns in fine form. The well-scripted and fantastic-looking campaign ends rather abruptly, but while it lasts, it's an exciting thrill ride of intense firefights and over-the-top set pieces. It can feel a little repetitive and relentless at times, but overall it's a lot of fun. The game's six-mode multiplayer PvP feels refined and well designed, and offers plenty of long-term potential, while Horde 3.0 is ideal for those who want to join friends in a long, and very challenging firefight.","My time with Gears of War 4 left me with a feeling that the game could have been a little more ambitious in spots. It feels a little too safe and too unwilling to ditch some of the traditions of the initial trilogy. But the ways it plays around with and reintroduces the characters from those Gears of War games is expertly handled, making for some great moments along the way.","Gears of War 4 is a great product. An epic Campaign, robust multiplayer mode with competitive elements and the new Horde Mode, makes it one of the best and more complete games of this year. Great addition to the Xbox One catalog.","The majesty of the original trilogy is absent in this game, but after the bland first few chapters the pace is lifted and we end up with a decent addition to the franchise. Next time The Coalition must try harder.","A strange combination of both familiar territory and a fresh feeling, Gears of War 4 provides and enjoyable and robust experience. While there isn't much new ground broken in the experience, it does a lot to remind us what was so great about the original games in the first place.",,"Gears of War 4 is a satisfying, if not overly familiar, return to some of the series’ best beats. A distinctly dark campaign dishes out welcome surprises and disappointing repeats in equal measure, while its refined Horde mode and thoroughly engaging multiplayer round off a package that any franchise fan should be happy to rev through.","Gears Of War 4 is an honest act of love for the saga, and for the countless fans who - over ten years - never stopped hoping for a glorious return to the heyday of the brand.","The Coalition’s debut in the Gears of War series is a very good action game, but at the same time it’s a shame the campaign falls short of the high standard of the IP.","This was a fine first showing but it'd be nice to see The Coalition carve its own identity for Gears of War. Using Epic's foundation is understandable and expected, but it often feels like a crutch. Marcus' boy had grown up just like him.","Gears of War 4 looked at the series’ core formula and figured that if it wasn’t broken, don’t fix it. Most of the additions The Coalition put onto that core simply helped enhance and refine something that was already great. A couple of missteps were made, but this is still a great overall entry in the franchise.","The series is certainly in safe hands, but we wish new developer The Coalition was a little bolder. [Dec 2016, p.70]",Campaign is worthy of its ancestors and will probably prompt more than one play through for hardcore fans. Versus and Horde 3.0 both add tons of replayability and the presentation package is the best in series history and is contemporaneously adroit.,"From the single-player to the co-op and multiplayer, every aspect of the game sings with quality as they successfully blend old traditions with new mechanics. There's already a ton of content in the game, which is great at giving you many possible ways to access it all. While the PC is the preferred platform to play the game, the Xbox One version is no slouch, as it still comes up with a solid experience. Overall, action fans will have a blast with this title.","While its bulk is impressive, it lacks a distinctive personality of its own. [Christmas 2016, p.106]","Gears of War 4 is the real deal - gorgeous to look at, smooth to play and packed full of content.","Gears Of War 4 is a success, then, even if it does take The Coalition a little too long to find its feet in its single-player campaign.","Gears of War 4 takes all the best things from the previous Gears of War-games and offers a new, thrilling part of the story. The balance between battle chaos and excellent controls offers hours and hours of fun.","The amount of quality content in multiplayer, and the ability to change Horde difficulty levels and play casual or competitive in Versus, makes Gears of War 4 a terrific deal, especially given the quality of the product.","The competitive multiplayer isn’t much of an evolution from previous efforts, and the campaign drags for a bit, but the high points make it worth the ride and the new Horde mode is simply stellar. If you’ve enjoyed this franchise previously or have a few friends looking for co-op, give Gears of War 4 a close look – it’s definitely worth the time.","As a complete package, Gears of War 4 is everything I could have asked for and more. Yes, I’ve got a few slight gripes with the lackluster final fight in the closing moments of the campaign and Horde 3.0’s class system, but as a whole, this is one game that every Gears fan needs to own.",,"Gears of War 4 is not a breakthrough for the franchise, but it underlines a successful transition from Epic Games to The Coalition. We would have loved more risk-taking, but overall it's still a great game.","Gears 4 is a painstakingly crafted love letter to those that have a meaty soft spot for the franchise. Aside from the costly cosmetic-focussed transactions, this is the exact experience that fans have been waiting for.","The Coalition Takes the best of Gears of War and makes it faster, fluid and spectacular. Gears of War 4 is the best reason to buy a Xbox One.","When it comes down to it, though, I play Gears games for their spectacular campaigns, and Gears of War 4’s single-player mode just doesn’t live up to the standard set by its predecessors. It’s too conservative to wow us the way we expect, and it lacks many of the larger-than-life personalities that made the original trilogy so fun and memorable.","Gears of War 4 offers everything you'd expect from a Gears title, and a surprising amount of great new ideas that enhance the core gameplay. Its campaign has problems in terms of story and characterisation, but in terms of fun is up there with the best the series has produced. The overall impression is that Gears of War is in thoroughly capable hands The Coalition. With more confident storytelling the studio could well produce a classic.","Gears of War 4 lives up to the expectations and even improves an almost perfect formula. The campaign introduces a new generation of heroes and enacts the passage from the past to the future, while the classic multiplayer modes and the most competitive ones are very entertaining and might keep players busy for an unquantifiable amount of time.","Gears of War 4 has pretty much the same mechanics that we are used to. It sure is entertaining, but at the same time a little too safe. Overall though, it’s still a great game that every Gears of War fan probably will enjoy.","Gears of War 4 delivers a familiar gameplay experience, while still feeling fresh and new. Although the campaign has its flaws, the story stays interesting. Together with the new and improved Horde mode and multiplayer, Gears of War 4 is a blast to play.","I might have my issues with the second half of the campaign, but I did like the return of Marcus Fenix.",,,"This is the best entry in the series. While the campaign isn't my favourite it still has a lot of character, the graphics are unmatched, the new Horde mode is fantastic, and it is all around one heck of a good time.","Gears of War 4 doesn't reinvent the formula but it definitely brings enough improvements without changing the core feel of Gears. With stellar production values, incredible action, series' best multiplayer, engaging new characters, and an introductory story that should satisfy new players and returning fans alike, Gears of War 4 may just be your new favorite Gears game. It's certainly mine.","After one day of playing GoW4, I knew it was an awesome title. After one month of diving deep into all campaign and multiplayer modes, that feeling hasn’t wavered. The developers showed hints of brilliance with their remake of the original Gears, but no one could have predicted just how firm a grasp they had on the intricacies of what makes this series so special. Its few flaws knocked my score down a few notches, but the gameplay is well-paced, gorgeous to watch, and tremendously satisfying. GoW4 a system-seller and a must-have title for any self-respecting fan of shooters.","Gears of War 4 is 100% a Gears game. Big man firing with big guns at big enemies, bad jokes and testosterone. Marcus is still too big to pass the torch to his son, even if we don't play his role. The multiplayer offer is a big tasty buffet and the visuals are stunning. It's good, but new ideas are still to be found.","Everything you could have hoped for, especially as a fan. Not as complete a story as expected, but that just gives us higher hopes for a follow up. This is our idea of fun: Wilder, bolder - either alone or with a mate.","Gears of War returns with a bang. Consistently thrilling and relentlessly entertaining, Gears 4 is comfortably one of the best shooters of the generation so far.","A gleefully gritty, gruesome, and grand continuation of the franchise.","Gears of War 4 as a whole looks interesting and it's definitely a pleasure to once again become an armed warrior and jump from cover to cover. The game may not impress in terms of graphics, and the universe is not as captivating as it used to be, but it's still good, demanding ""Gears"" - and that's crucial.",,"Gears of War 4 is a best of-game, offering all the things we love about previous Gears of War games. It's obvious The Coalition knows the franchise, and respects it.","If you own an Xbox One, you'll have a fine enough time thanks to smooth, 60-frames-per-second multiplayer combat. But the game's best performance—with higher settings and resolutions, still easily locked at 60fps—can only be yours if you have a moderately powerful Windows 10 PC.",,,"The fourth installment of Gears of War tells a lighter, more personal tale, but it always returns to the defiant thrill of survival. The silence of the music cutting out and the guns going quiet after the end of a terrible battle. The deep breath. It’s what the old character here is getting at, I think. In a place like Sera, where everything wants to kill you, the opportunity to fight—and win—is a blessing. I missed it, too.","Brutal action, addictive multiplayer, shredded bodies and stunning visuals. Developers from The Coalition showed that they belong among the leaders in this field. The fourth part of Gears of War can only be recommended. [Issue #268]",,Gears Of War 4 does everything required to bring the franchise roadie-running into 2016 without losing what made it so good to begin with. One of the best games on the Xbox One.,"If you were nervous how the new studio was going to handle the Gears series, put those fears to rest, as The Coalition has delivered an experience that feels new yet familiar at the same time and worthy of the Gears of War title. Whether you’re coming for the campaign, competitive multiplayer, or Horde mode, Gears of War 4 has tremendous value and replayability and ushers in the new generation some change for the series.","It does, however, stay true to the gameplay mechanics of its predecessors, and provides countless hours of rewarding multiplayer options. The Gears faithful should rejoice, as a new saga is just getting lubricated.",,"What does stand out are the weather effects, which fill the screen with debris and drop cover in your path - or just as easily rip it away. With constant windflares and lightning storms, this might be the loudest Gears yet. There are some off-the-wall vehicular segments and executions are at their goriest peak. Technically speaking, Gears of War 4 is solid.",The Coalition’s development team did a fantastic job adopting the Gears of War series. They’ve preserved what makes it special in our hearts and added in new bells and whistles which are absolutely welcome.,"A very well-executed, bug-free game with awesome technical effects. The single-player campaign is on the short side at nine hours, but it gives you everything that you want and expect in a Gears of War game. The Coalition does a decent job walking the tightrope of providing something that fans want and giving them something different at the same time. The Horde mode has taken the co-op play in a very good direction, and I expect that fans are going to enjoy multiplayer quite a bit as well. If I had to pick one flaw, it’s that this game has too wide a range, with a lot of humor and a lot of terror all at once.",,"Gears of War 4 is exactly what a fan of the series was waiting for. The campaign does not introduce anything new, but it works and it's graphically astonishing, while the online modes are totally fun. Go and buy GOW4 without any hesitation.",Gears of War 4 is an impressive return to form.,,,,,,,"This is one of the best games to be released this year, without a doubt. While the campaign may have felt a bit short with its abrupt ending, it left me itching for a sequel.",,,,,,,,Gears of War 4 is simply more of the things that players know and love. The developers may have failed during the creation of a cool single-player campaign and the new heroes are pale shadows of previously used veterans but the multiplayer portion of the game shines. This is its strongest part that deserves every praise.,"The ship has a new captain, but Gears of War is still about guts, glory and camaraderie. Buckle up, grab your Lancer and go kick some Swarm buttocks. [Nov 2016]","The new installment of the Gears of War saga is just what the fans were expecting after Judgment. Even though its story mode is a bit short, its gameplay mechanics and graphics will make you fall in love with Gears of War 4.","Gears of War 4 is the best game in the series so far with more likable characters and a better and more well-written story. The story of friendship and family fits well with the summer blockbuster style that the series has always strived for. Full of action, some humour and maybe even a few scares thrown in with the mix, more than anything else it looks like The Coalition is determined to mature the Gears franchise, and that is hardly a bad thing at all.","With a solid campaign, and the brilliant multiplayer which will keep you going for days on end, the Gears of War franchise is in safe hands.","It's a tacky but thoroughly pleasant reminder of what we remember as simpler times, back when a game could just be about cover-based shooting, when developers felt that dumping millions into baroque campaigns of love, loss, and headshots seemed to make some sort of sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,The game's successes as a continuation of Gears of War's narrative falter in the face of stubbornly archaic gameplay.,,,"I’m left wondering what a true metamorphosis of Gears could look like, how this series could go about defining a new generation of video games. It’s a lot to ask. Gears of War might continue as on as it has, a single revolution followed by a lifetime of refinement. It’s enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I’m impressed by how well The Coalition has remained faithful to the core of Gears of War while putting their own mark on the series. A memorable single-player experience blended with a robust suite of co-op and competitive multiplayer options, Gears of War 4 is a surprisingly great return to a franchise I thought I could live without...Genre-defining? Not quite. Maybe that will come with Gears 5. Or Gears 6. That’s the thing about a Fenix – they always rise again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[Christmas 2015, p.55]",,"Halo 5 has a short, albeit dramatic campaign, full of action and huge, visually striking environments that will leave you wanting for more, literally, because its ending is a little bit anticlimactic too. But, despite all of this, fans of the Halo Universe will have a great time playing through it, especially if they've got a team of friends at hand. And the multiplayer component might well be the best we've seen in all the series. Warzone will soon place itself among the most memorable and beloved game modes in the story of Halo.",,"There are some changes to the Halo franchise in terms of gameplay but overall 343 Industries have done a decent job to the series through its slight tweaks to gameplay. Sure, the campaign mode is a little dry but nonetheless I still enjoyed it and really wanted more Master Chief areas.",,"The story may well be confusing – especially for newcomers – and many characters are sadly lacking in depth, but that doesn’t detract from how fun shooting your way through the game’s fifteen missions is when playing solo and even more so with three friends.","It’s a well-crafted Halo experience with enough new bells and whistles to turn around even the most jaded Halo fan, and feels exactly like what you’d want a next-gen Halo game to be. There’s a hefty amount of content to explore here across the campaign and multiplayer modes, with a large map variety at launch and an enjoyable story to uncover. And it all looks and sounds absolutely gorgeous, with fantastic enemy and map designs on top of the excellent technical groundwork behind it all.","Halo 5: Guardians shines thanks to its great environments and level design; the story is satisfying and even surprising, but we would have liked a deeper characterization for the new Spartans, and while online co-op is great, we miss local split-screen. Where the game really flexes its muscles, though, is in the multiplayer modes: Warzone is a brilliant and addicting new addition, while Arena gets rid of many complexities of the past offering us a very straightforward, solid and rewarding competitive experience.",,,,"For the most part, Bungie achieved this lofty balance with its Halo games, but after an impressive first shot at the sci-fi series with Halo 4, 343 Industries has fumbled with one of the most important parts of a Halo experience: the solo campaign.",,,"Certainly not a bad Halo game, but one that succeeds despite its innovations, not because of them. With multiplayer the high point, Halo 5 is worthwhile, if not always truly convincing.","Guardians’ multiplayer harkens back to the Halo 2 glory days with tons of balanced maps and fun modes, and the tactical new Warzone mode absolutely steals the show.","Any worry that Halo might be in the wrong hands with 343 Industries has been wiped out by Halo 5: Guardians. Taking what works, removing what didn't, and refining nearly every aspect of the experience, Halo 5 is an immediate classic that is on par with its predecessors.",,,"A masterpiece, and quite possibly the best Halo game so far. The campaign is top-notch, even as Master Chief shares the spotlight, and the multiplayer is largely a return to everything that has made the franchise so beloved to begin with.","Halo 5: Guardians is a fantastic step for the series. 343 Industries proves it knows the series, and this being the first official game on the Xbox One,",Going through the campaign once by myself was fun. But doing it again on heroic or legendary with friends is even better. Plus Warzone is addictive.,,,"Halo 5: Guardians is an exciting Halo package, marred only by some questionable design decisions, like microtransactions and some shoddy friendly-AI in the campaign. It’s not a classic Halo, but 343 is moving in a good direction with the franchise.",,,"In some ways, Halo 5 is the boldest Halo yet. The franchise's multiplayer is at its peak, with a mode I'm sure I'll return to several times over. But then there's the campaign, which introduces fluid new movement and open level design, yet can't tell a coherent story to match. There are signs of a phenomenal shooter here, but certain narrative aspects feel underdeveloped, holding the franchise's newest sequel back from true excellence.",Halo 5 Guardians hits all the right notes in a campaign that is thrilling from end to end and delivers a multiplayer suite full of many delights that play impeccably.,,,"The entire game is plenty of fun, and despite those light storytelling flaws, this is one of the finest games of 2015. Halo 5: Guardians held the pressure of the Xbox One on its shoulders, as well as the pressure of one of gaming’s most well-known and legendary franchises...The greatest compliment to Halo 5? It handles all that pressure just fine.","Aside from some extremely minor hiccups in matchmaking that appear to have been quickly resolved, Halo 5 has been rock solid, and has also seen regular playlist updates and tweaks to address community concerns.","343 Industries is clearly passionate, but it’s shown a criminal misunderstanding of what makes the franchise work. Halo 5: Guardians has moments of greatness, but it’s a shadow of its former self.","While the multiplayer components are the best since Halo 3, the campaign disappoints in a few key areas. It's still enjoyable and exciting on the whole, but it lacks the narrative concentration and the memorable gameplay scenarios to stand neck and neck with the best entries in the series. Halo 5: Guardians still gets a massive recommendation from us for many reasons, though there's certainly room for 343 Industries to improve and evolve the campaign formula next time around.","The latest Halo is a big deal only for hardcore Halo fans. For me the single player campaign was unbearably pompous and despite 1080p and 60 fps the visuals are not as breathtaking as they once were in Halo 4. The game builds a solid foundation for Halo 6, but it’s not one of those games you absolutely have to play. [13/2015, p.48]","Though the story is a draw for longtime fans, most people will be stopping in to check out Halo 5's multiplayer, and it's there 343's direction really shines. Warzone is a lot of fun, and Arena's classic inspiration is made all the better thanks to 343's latest twists to core mechanics. It's gorgeous, it's fast-paced, and it's a blast to play regardless of your skill level. Halo 5 is absolutely the flagship title the Xbox One deserves.",,"Chaotic story campaign which ends with a cruel cliffhanger is rescued by a gameplay and great cooperation. Plus, a perfect multiplayer with an amazing Warzone mode prevents any possible disappointment.","While the campaign is rather bland in comparison to older Halos, the multiplayer shines brighter than ever and promises more fun than ever before – if you can live with the microtransactions.","With so much at stake, Halo 5 needed to be a new perfection of old triumphs, or a landscape-altering revolution. In terms of its campaign it falls short of both of these ideals. Online, however, 343 has taken more significant risks, of the sort that first convinced Apple and Microsoft to place bets on the series. Warzone, in particular, is a kind of bold design that we almost never see in expensive FPS game-making any more.",,"Halo 5: Guardians is a fine-tuned machine. It has a robust and highly addictive competitive multiplayer component, a large variety of aesthetically pleasing customizations and some of the tightest controls to ever grace a Halo title. Unfortunately, the campaign leaves much to be desired.",,"For the first time, Halo is fully embracing the broader fiction established in other mediums, drawing in characters and concepts of greater complexity. As a result, the universe feels more nuanced, even if some less devoted players may get lost in the jargon. Beautiful cut scenes lend a cinematic vibe to the ongoing adventure, which sees Master Chief chasing the one thing that can make him turn away from his duty, and a new generation of Spartans ordered to bring him back.","The story campaign is a mild disappointment but the multiplayer is a bold reinvention of the Halo experience, that should keep the series fresh for years to come.","Halo 5: Guardians obviously isn’t meant to be played for its by the numbers campaign. If your love for Halo falls strictly within the realm of multiplayer, then prepare yourself for a grand old time.",,,,"Solid multiplayer action, but brought down a notch by a campaign that just doesn't live up to the hype.","One nice return, despite leaving some core features behind. Halo 5: Guardians manages to entertain and sets the basis for the franchise's future.","Halo 5: Guardians is one of the most fun shooters of this generation. It has some problems in the single-player, but emerges and petrifies its competitors in multiplayer.","Halo 5 is a game Xbox One users cannot miss. There are some aspects of it we haven't enjoyed so much, but in general terms it's an experience that lives up to the bar set by its predecessors.","Halo 5’s campaign has the sleek, varied confidence of a guaranteed moneymaker.",Guardians feels like a huge missed opportunity to evolve Halo beyond simple combat.,"Flawless gameplay, one of the best multiplayer experiences on the market and a shiny, new coat of paint make Halo 5: Guardians an easy contender for Game of the Year.",,,"Top echelon storytelling, new gameplay mechanics, vast and beautiful landscapes, and a superbly designed multiplayer, has soared Halo 5: Guardians to my favorite in the series.","Halo 5 is an outstanding game and one of the finest first-person shooters ever made. Its design is versatile, and it’s the best-playing entry in the series so far.","Halo 5: Guardians is Halo evolved. The campaign ends with a whimper but is great until that point, and Warzone ably expands the series' peerless multiplayer.",,"Halo 5: Guardians is okay. Its campaign is rubbish, but the multiplayer is solid thanks to the foundation it’s built upon. Warzone is a really enjoyable experience, and while combat is still mostly about tossing grenades and hitting the melee button, the whole Requisition gimmick adds some much-needed flavor to proceedings.","Halo 5: Guardians features an underwhelming, confusing and surprisingly banal campaign that's not actively bad, but equally not quite good enough to warrant a purchase on its own.","Halo 5's campaign will not be the groundbreaking adventure that sends players flocking to the Xbox One, but Warzone's sprawling battles twinned with the precision of Arena just might tempt competitive shooter fans to take the plunge. Work to be done for both 343 and the Xbox One, then, but this is a formidable start.",,"What happens in Halo 5‘s story, by contrast, feels disappointingly by the numbers, the mysteries not so mysterious after all, the archetypes shuffled back to their starting blocks by the finale. The big plot twist, where the game finally tries to provoke an emotional crisis, feels strangely underwhelming, its sentiment too one-sided given how sanguine and taciturn the story’s heroes are. The novelty of poring ourselves as players into the emotionally blank space where a person ought to be in these games may no longer be working.","Halo 5 : Guardians is undoubtedly a game worthy of the Halo name. Its campaign opens an interesting new page in the Halo saga and its gameplay is, as always, on point. The game also benefits from the addition of the Warzone mode, a fun new twist on the classic Halo multiplayer experience. It really is too bad that local coop/multiplayer was taken out.","The campaign mode hits some great highs over its somewhat short 15-mission span, but also occasionally suffers from a lack of variety, and some boss fights that feel disappointingly one-note. Halo 5: Guardians' strength is found in its PvP. Arena and Warzone offer two distinctly different flavors of action, and both are solid, very well designed, and a lot of fun to play. Ultimately, campaign is a good way to ease you into the game - but it's the PvP that delivers the best of what this game has to offer.","There will certainly be some players who find that the specific omissions in Halo 5 are extremely disappointing, and you'll see a rough edge or two, but all in all there's a fantastic big-budget shooter in Halo 5 with lots to see and enough multiplayer options to keep you going for quite some time.","Halo 5: Guardians it's a versatile FPS with a high value for any fan of the genre, including the campaign and the multiplayer equally. It definitely keeps most of the essence of the franchise, sadly, the split-screen is highly missed.","Another masterpiece by 343 Industries that retains and advances all those elements for which Halo became a beloved FPS series. While the perfunctory character of Locke could be described as a mishap the campaign nevertheless opens up exciting new prospects for the next installment of Halo. Moreover, the multiplayer remains as fresh as ever, especially due to the addition of the utterly enjoyable and hectic Warzone mode.","It's not perfect, but this might be the best single-player Halo campaign ever written. 343 finally feels like it's taking the franchise in a new direction—and it's a good one. Just don't expect closure.","Halo 5 Guardians is a great new iteration in the Halo franchise. Frantic and intense gunplay against a large number of enemies, though it could be better in vehicles missions. 343i's game shines with the new and great Warzone mode and balanced and intense Arena multiplayer.","A short, disappointing tale makes nearly no progress in 343’s trilogy, and offers nothing that lives up to the billing of a tense showdown between Halo 5’s two protagonists. Thankfully the improved gameplay and consistently great multiplayer shine in Halo's uneven debut on the Xbox One. The multiplayer is fantastic, and the co-op is magical. Bring friends.","The online really shines, since it's able to offer something new in Warzones and something really solid and classic with Arena mode. On the other hand, the campaign focuses too much on cooperative Covenant killing, and much less on the quality of the script, and that, considering the precious heritage of the saga, is a real shame.",The combination of an excellent campaign and an amazing multiplayer makes Halo’s debut on Xbox One truly a must-have.,"If it weren't for Warzone, Halo 5: Guardians would probably be somewhere on the lower end of the franchise's spectrum for me. It's still a fantastic and well-oiled machine, but the story falls flat, and the shift in gameplay mechanics result in the loss of some elements that made the series so unique in the first place. Still, if you're looking to shoot some dudes online, Guardians is your huckleberry.","The continuation of a new Master Chief saga, the refinement and additions to multiplayer for casual and pros alike, plus a gorgeous presentation made possible by current generation technology—all add up to the makings of a FPS worthy of the Halo series’ best iterations.","Although the story feels less of an event, Halo 4's campaign is a thoroughly satisfying spectacle. [Dec 2015, p.64]","Guardians is a very good game. Campaign is very strong while adding a few items here and there that make it an independent experience. Multiplayer stands tall along side the best in series history, and time will tell where it ultimately ranks among H2 and H3.","Halo 5's single-player campaign is fun, but the game is at its best when you're coordinating with others and attacking objectives as a team.","Halo 5 is full of good decisions and fantastic multiplayer experiences, but in trying to catch up, it might have shown how far behind it really is. [Christmas 2015, p.98]",,"Halo 5: Guardians exists only because it had to. It isn’t a bad game, it’s just a catastrophically uninteresting one.","343 Industries shows that it is not shy of renewing a franchise so familiar. Especially with Arena, it shows how much quicker and more precise Halo 5 feels. Thanks to the perfect combination of shooting, hitting and throwing grenades, it is still exactly what we have loved about this franchise over the last 15 years.","Halo 5: Guardians is a smashing success. The campaign isn’t the strongest of the series, but it’s still a fun space opera romp, and it’s ending transforms the Halo universe completely...The phenomenal multiplayer makes this a must-have game, and probably the most compelling Xbox One exclusive to date.","It’s not the best Halo game I’ve ever played, but it is good, delivering most of the Halo essentials without compromise.","Halo 5 has come through addressing a lot of the concerns that fans had leading up to its launch. The online multiplayer is stable, delivers classic Halo multiplayer, and freshens it up all at the same time. The single player campaign is enjoyable enough for those looking for a classic FPS experience, but not all too bothered about a strong story.","The narrative missteps and overly complicated lore intrude on what should have been another shining moment for Master Chief; while it sets up an intriguing future, the campaign is an unqualified disappointment. But even the greatest of heroes stumbles, and Halo 5’s stellar online play is certainly strong enough to pick up the Chief and keep him moving.",By staying steady on the steed 343 industries insures a nice game with Halo 5 Guardians. The solo offers a smooth ride and the new Warzone multiplayer mode is a great addition to the game as it offers a good option for more casual players.,"Halo 5: Guardians may stumble in regards to split-screen multiplayer, but it’s still a game that’ll grow in the months proceeding its launch.","Halo 5 Guardians has lost some good elements, like the split screen or the armor abilities on campaign mode but the perfect weapon balance, the excellent level design of the multiplayer maps and the Warzone mode are so good that nobody should care about those missing items. It has enough content to keep us playing for months.","Warzone is actually the first Halo multiplayer mode I can see myself jumping into with strangers more than a few weeks after the game comes out. In the past, Halo multiplayer got so competitive so quickly after launch that it simply became no fun unless you had enough friends to fill out the teams.",,"What 343 Industries did with the gameplay is definitely great. They had the balls to change a beloved formula, and finally hit their true mark in the series. Halo 5's competitive multiplayer is also an amazing experience, varied and fun, and the addition of Warzones is fantastic for those players who love chaotic battles in large maps. The campaign, though, is disappointing both in structure and in story. Characters, situations, and all the possibilities given by the presence of two different teams were completely wasted, and that's truly a pity. Get it for the multiplayer, not for the story.",,"Halo 5 Guardians is a great new installment in this massive series. The game mixes old and new elements resulting in an awesome gaming experience. However, the lack of couch co-op makes it less fun, and our iconic hero Master Chief seems to be a background character.","If you’re looking for a frag-fest, plus all the enticements of the new Warzone mode, Halo 5 is a must-own. All the new abilities and maps are terrific. Those who care about the single-player campaign might not find the story to be as compelling but will appreciate the treatment of lore and production value. Either way, In the coming months, Halo 5: Guardians will undoubtedly have both supporters and detractors playing and commenting about it for years.","Halo Moments are revelations of accidental mastery, happenstance perfection, the butterfly effect of a shock wave blooming out from the epicenter of a frag grenade. A grenade that only you could have thrown. It only matters that it happened, and that you and your friend, for a simultaneous second, remembered why it was you loved playing games in the first place.",Halo 5 is a first-class sci-fi shooter with a great campaign and diverse multiplayer modes. The best shooter for Xbox One.,"What Halo fans should worry about is that Halo 5 drops best practice when it comes to gradually increasing campaign difficulty and replaces them with a formula that counts the number of mini bosses already defeated and respawns them all plus one more boss every few levels. Trust me, when you’re fighting 3 identical bosses at once, the whole encounter feels like it lacks originality.",Visually the game is pretty much a stunner.,"343 Industries made a terrific impression with their first dip into the franchise, but with a lackluster campaign and multiplayer that still needs tuning, Halo 5: Guardians makes them look like one-hit wonders.","Halo 5: Guardians stands up to all the hype with stunning battles, brilliant sound, hugely inspired campaign, dedicated servers and balanced gameplay. 343 Industries finally reached maturity just in time to give Xbox One its much needed top notch first person shooter.",,"The best Halo campaign since Reach, Guardians is a return to form - but more Chief next time, please, and less microtransactions.","Fantastic gameplay, vistas and multiplayer modes, with a story that’s on the cusp of being an epic.","Halo 5 lacks something fresh and surprising, a breath of new life. The campaign is interrupted in the wrong moment and the lack of split-screen is disappointing, but these cons are balanced out by addictive and satisfying multiplayer. The game is not without certain defects, but it's still worth recommending.","On principle Halo 5: Guardians’ grade should be historically low due to the fact that 343 Industries left out the splitscreen co-op, but that would be unjust. Because its single player campaign has been improved from that of Halo 4 –although not narratively-, the multiplayer has been modernized (more than the single player) and the new Spartan skills are almost all great additions. Halo 5: Guardians is a great shooter, but once again not one of the greatest entries in the Halo saga.","343 Industries is not Bungie and that shows in Halo 5: Guardians. It is a unique Halo game that offers the series a new future. The single player has the feel of a triple A science fiction epic, while the addictive multiplayer often makes us reminisce about Halo 2 in those good old days.","Currently, there's still a lot of Halo 5 to love—and just about as much to raise our eyebrows at—but the multiplayer is the winner here. Even Warzone's card-collecting gimmick hasn't stopped us from loving the series' biggest battles yet, while our experiences in Arena have ranged from solid, standard Spartan blasting to some of the most eye-bulging fun we've had dueling on Xbox Live in years.",,,,Developers from 343 Industries have finally caught the right way and with the fifth part they fixed the mistakes which they made in the previous installment. So they provide the players with an absolutely perfect and catchy campaign. [Issue#258],,,,"From the groundbreaking graphics to the adrenaline pumping campaign and the online component, this game is a must-own for any shooter fan that is looking to see what the ‘true’ next-gen gaming experience should be like. If you have an Xbox One (with Xbox Live) and love competitive shooters, Halo 5: Guardians is a must-own.",,,,The saving grace of this game is multiplayer.,,,,"343 Industries managed to rectify some of Halo 4’s mistakes, but most of its shortcomings are still present. [Issue#203, p.56]",,,,,,"Halo 5: Guardians isn't 343's first Halo game, but it's the first that really makes the series its own. This isn't a reflection of Bungie's efforts, or a remaster, or stage-setting. The studio has put its own identity on this Halo game with smart moves like a more identifiable story and a wider array of multiplayer options, along with increased polish like Guardians' incredible visual punch and impeccable multiplayer balance.",,,,,,,,"Halo 5 has a run-of-the-mill campaign that isn't as interesting or exciting as the one from Halo 4. Of course, that doesn't make the game weak - you can play with pleasure and impatiently wait for the final chapter of the new trilogy. But Guardians shines in a different aspect: the multiplayer portion of the game is phenomenal and will keep you glued to the screen for hundreds of hours.","With a more accessible and engaging story and solid new designs for the Prometheans, Halo 5 is a major improvement over Halo 4. Warzone is a great addition to the multiplayer, though the mode seems to have some game balance issues. [Nov 2015]",,"Halo 5: Guardians deserves credit for taking chances and trying some new things. It would be safest and easiest to simply modify what has worked in the past and gloss it up and send it out, but modes like Warzone in multiplayer and the shift to a party structure in the campaign are chances that mostly work out well.","Halo 5: Guardians might deliver a shaky story, but with fantastic gameplay and new abilities you've never felt more like a super soldier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,The ultimate irony here is that what gets our species in trouble in the campaign's narrative is ultimately the kind of needless combat that the game excels at.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I’d worry I was being too harsh on Halo 5’s story if I didn’t know so well that the Halo universe is capable of supporting some great storytelling. It’s impossible for me not to reflect on games like Halo: ODST and Halo: Reach when I play the Halo 5 campaign. It feels like pastiche of earlier days that I hope Halo eventually returns to.,"It's a difficult verdict: For the first time, Halo has left its own roots and tried something different. The Campaign mode is below expectations but multiplayer modes and features are shining. Welcome back John-117.","A superb campaign, particularly in its level design, coupled with the all-new Warzone mode and the return of arena multiplayer makes Halo 5 the best FPS game of this generation and possibly the best Halo title ever.",,,,The multiplayer is worth the ticket price.,"Halo 5: Guardians is a massive game that we intend to keep playing for the foreseeable future. There are parts that let us down, particularly the story, but it’s hard to feel too stung when there’s just so much fun to be had. Halo 5 has a lot to prove and it seems fully capable of doing just that. It’s a pleasure seeing the series in top form once again.","Halo 5: Guardians is an entertaining action adventure whose fate rests on whether the online mode works or not (still to early to raise the green flag). Besides that, it's a really well made Halo game. The graphics are detailed, and the frame rate is smoother that ever. The campaign is solid enough, but lacks those memorable moments that defined the first couple of games in the series.","It's a shame that Halo 5's story is disappointing, because nearly everything else surrounding it is fantastic. The friendly AI definitely needs work, and there are a few too many enemy types that need to be attacked from behind in order to damage, but the level design is some of the best the series has ever seen, and the new abilities the player can use dramatically improve both the campaign and multiplayer. Throw in the robust Breakout and Warzone multiplayer modes and I think it's safe to say that you could find yourself wrapped in Halo 5 for quite some time.",,"Everything looks and plays spectacularly in Halo 5: Guardians, and it was so close to having the complete package for a first-person shooter. Unfortunately, the hype oversold and underdelivered when it came to story, and the non-shooting missions should have been scrapped until the team figured out a more creative way to entice player exploration in the middle of a shooter.",,,,,,,,"I think die-hard Halo fans will love Halo 5: Guardians, as it’s a game made almost exclusively with them in mind. The rest of us might find ourselves a little lost, a bit let down and wistful for an old horizon that once reached for the heavens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[Nov 2017, p.76]",,,,,,"Building on last year's already successful iteration, F1 2017 has been tweaked, polished and refined. On top of all that, a whole load of new content has been added making it feel that there are almost two games in one. There's more to motorsport than just driving speedily around tracks and this year's installment has done its best to capture this. The massively expanded research and development tree and the new engine management system bring an extra level of detail that might frustrate the more casual player but that no doubt delights true Formula 1 fans. The racing remains as good as ever for all levels of drivers and with all of the new championships and invitationals, short track variants and classic cars, there is plenty of racing to be done. In short, this is possibly the most complete F1 title for a long time, and arguably the best in the franchise.",,"Codemasters keeps on improving an already great franchise, adding more variety and tactical depth to all races. A must buy for any F1 lover.","F1 2017 is a very fun and entertaining game to play but it doesn't look as good as it should. If we focus only on gameplay and game modes, this game is excellent and delivers a magnificent experience for the F1 fans around the world as Codemasters used to.","F1 2017 is the best F1 game developed by Codemasters. Included are an improved career mode, new and impressive physics and a totally new game mode.","It's a shame that it suffers from so much tearing. It's admirable that Codemasters wanted to keep a high frame rate going, and that much is fact. But it's hard to deny how horribly distracting they are when they come...Everywhere else, F1 2017 is a thoroughly enjoyable, deeply engrossing experience that both fans and newcomers will enjoy.",,"So yes, it seems that we have finally got it - the one true to life Formula One racing experience we have been begging for in recent years.",,,,,,"If you’re a fan of racing games, F1 2017 should be considered an essential purchase — even if, like me, you don’t follow the sport. The racing is seat of your pants stuff just like it ought to be, and its career mode is simply phenomenal and offers tens of hours of in-depth gameplay. With F1 2017, Codemasters may have just made the best Formula 1 game ever, and I just can’t wait to see how they aim to top it.",,,,,,"F1 2017 delivers big in all departments, with every mode you can care to think of, an expansive, in-depth Career mode, and a fantastic selection of online options. Add to that lot the return of classic F1 cars, and F1 2017 is a champagne-popping winner and no mistake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For me, the true tell of a successful game is one that excites that passion for racing and vehicles. Racing is more than just laps on a circuit, but vehicle management, lap times and the thrill of the chase and victory. F1 2017 easily achieves this, and continues upon the brilliance that was F1 2016 last year. Fans of the motorsport and racing in general would certainly do well to check out this title, with Codemasters once again proving themselves as one of the leaders of the genre.",,,,,,,,"At first glance, F1 2017 may appear to be a minor update to an annual franchise, but the truth is that it’s a real evolution for the genre.","At the end of the day, F1 2017 is basically what you expect it to be. A Formula 1 simulator that does a solid job which will likely serve many for hours on end. I can’t see it pulling in many new players but it certainly should suffice for the existing fanbase. It would have been nice to see Codemasters take it to the next level with lower tier Formula cars and non-calendar tracks but it is what it is. Give it a try if you’re an avid racing game fan but otherwise there are currently many more accessible titles out there for getting into the genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"F1 2007 is the best racing game of 2017 thus far and is astounding from start to finish.

A-1 graphics, driving feel, skill-tree, and most importantly – career mode, there is just nothing better out there.",,,,,,,,You may not find the real life 2017 Formula 1 season engaging and exciting but in the gaming sense it’s the best its ever been. The addition of historic cars is wonderful and weaving them into the career as special events a masterstroke. Codemasters have paid careful attention to where they needed to improve and left well alone the areas that they didn’t. This was mostly in the career mode and the cars themselves as really very little had to be done in regards to time-trials and multiplayer racing. It’s paid off in spades and I’m even more excited to see how much better things will look post-XBox One X release given that F1 2017 is one of the games that will be enhanced for Microsoft’s new console. Gaming F1 fans like myself have been waiting for Codemasters to realise the potential of their past titles since they took up the license in 2010. They’ve taken their time and had a few missteps along the way but my word have they got it right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's simple: F1 2017 is the best Formula 1 game ever made.

When the game works, it’s great, incomplete sure but great, but that’s just the problem, when it works. I’ll keep at it and hopefully more patches will bridge the gap in play-ability and maybe with a few little tweaks as well this game can return it is series’ former glory.","Despite some very minor issues, F1 2018 is the best of its kind, and certainly the best in the series so far. The high level of visual and audio detail, grouped with the care and attention to authenticity, collectively makes for an experience that’s robust, faithful and deep. Codemasters’ subtle yet noticeable changes over F1 2017 takes an already distinguished racer and makes it bigger and better than ever.","F1 2018 is the best game in the series we've seen in this console generation. It is just about as complete an F1 experience as it can get without going into the realm of full-blown simulation both from the action and management side. The extra depth added by contracts, rivalries, media and team management may not be for those who just want to race, but diehard fans of the sport who follow the headlines day in and day out will have a sense that they are really being involved in a virtual version of the sport. Racing remains the core of the game and Codemasters has continued to make this accessible to all players regardless of their racing proficiency.",,"Codemasters keeps on perfecting its F1 sim, adding even more gameplay choices and making its Campaign yet more engaging and interesting.

It can feel a little bit continuist with some technical flaws that are recurrent, but its new options in Career Mode and its multiplayer will make you feel the passion of the real Formula One Circus.","A complete, positive and visually very good experience. One of the best F1 games.","F1 2018, just as with last year's game, is a game worthy of your attention and something fans of the franchise will love.

battle-chasers-nightwar,,,,,,,"Battle Chasers: Nightwar is a magnificent success. At first glance, the beautiful visuals draw you with hopes the gameplay could match how excellent they look... and it does. The JRPG combat requires deep, tactical thought in nearly every battle as you push through your foes. Unlike most RPGs, even the random fights will often require some thinking to determine what to use to benefit you both in the current fight and in future fights, as resources are not always infinite. Bosses most of all can feel like epic battles where your strategy plays a key part in the process. Backed by strong character development and plenty of side content to keep you going, this is an RPG any fan of the genre would be a fool to miss. It's not perfect, but few games ever are. What's here is excellent and it comes highly recommended.",,"A solid old school turn-based RPG, graced by Madureira's awesome art but a little bit unbalanced towards combat rather than narration. Definitely a game to consider by lovers of the genre.",Battle Chasers: Nightwar is an awesome modern exponent of the great virtues of the most classic RPGs. A long and fun game with a fantastic design that the veteran players will appreciate for their tactical turn-based combat and character progression.,"Airship Syndicate brings a title where some points fail, such as optimization or a more immersive soundtrack, but has an excellent artistic section, a very intuitive combat system and an acceptable duration, which will be the perfect excuse for those who have never dared to take turn-based RPG games.",,"I played on both PC and Xbox One and found -- for the most part -- it to run satisfactorily, but it does suffer from some long loads and frame-rates can chug a bit if you’ve had it running in any background for too long.

Addictive, challenging and charming in its throwback love, coupled with stunning art, Battle Chasers: Nightwar is a gamer’s game. It doesn’t over-promise to under-deliver, and perfectly delivers on its premise. Absolutely worth your investment.","Battle Chasers: Nightwar is a throwback to classic JRPGs, but in many ways an improvement.

yooka-laylee-and-the-impossible-lair,"Yooka-Laylee smartly ditches 3D to instead focus on perfecting 2D platforming. [Issue#184, p.77]",,,,,Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair is very enjoyable and should appeal to many with its distinctly memorable characters and almost limitless customisation opportunities. It certainly has a high entertainment value bringing a more up to date and fresh approach to a genre that other developers have tried to revive with somewhat less success. The music is exciting flowing seamlessly through different areas and never becomes irritating. No part of play gets frustrating because of the ability to skip or customise levels and the depth of design in every character and their dialogue brings it all together so seemingly effortlessly. A confident thumbs up.,,,,,"The dynamic duo Yookay and Laylee returns in a new adventure, although this time in 2D. A worthy sequel with a classic and deep gameplay that manages not to fall into monotony. All in all, Yookay-Layee and the impossible liar is a great platform title.",,"If there’s one gripe to be had, which could be said of the original Yooka-Laylee from 2017 is that some of the stages feel overly large to traverse – which can adversely affect the pacing. That said, that’s only a minor gripe as Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair succeeds in delivering a fun, challenging, and rewarding old-school romp. By incorporating some of the classic 2D design of previous generations this once N64 throwback has matured and grown into its own slice of platforming gold.","Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair really feels like a game designed for all ages. Veteran players will appreciate the standard difficulty of the game, whilst younger ones may benefit from a few Tonics to help them on their way.",,,,,,"It’s challenging, humorous, beautifully designed and offers a surprising amount of variety. However you feel about the insurmountable challenge of its final level, there’s still plenty to enjoy outside of that. If you enjoy platforming games, you’ll find a lot to love here. And did I mention how cute Yooka and Laylee are?",,"I love this game. Playtonic definitely made something special here. It’s going to be hard to look at other platformers without wondering why they didn’t ape more of the concepts from The Impossible Lair. Not to mention the soundtrack by Grant Kirkhope and David Wise – which is probably one of my favorite soundtracks of the year. While I hope they give the 3D platformer another fair shake, I will be more than happy if Playtonic does more sidescrolling platformers in the future because The Impossible Lair is impossibly good.",,,,"After the first Yooka-Laylee, you could be forgiven for not being desperate for more, but Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair is a more accomplished and markedly different game to its forebear. And it's all the better for it.","Yooka-Laylee finally succeeds in bringing the platformer to the next level. With an original structure, made of puzzle and reverse narration, this new episode brings a fresh OST and some great ideas, while being sometimes too difficult or unprecise. A really good game for nostalgics and newcommers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair ironically does justice to the impossible task of living up to the name of great platforming games like Super Mario Bros, Donkey Kong Country, and Rayman Legends. It’s a joy to play, feeling simultaneously modern and yet nostalgic. The odd omission of boss battles and some issues with variety aside, Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair is a game any self-respecting platformer fan should play.","While I’m annoyed that the Lair itself is more frustrating than fun, it’s that very quality that keeps you coming back to beat it.","A love letter to the Donkey Kong Country series, Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair goes beyond a standard homage, and crafts something beautiful of its own. Fantastic challenging platforming, spanning across 40 imaginative levels, and a charming graphical art style. This is an essential 2D platformer that should not be missed, even more so by the fact that it is being sold for budget point.",,Yooka-Laylee and The Impossible Lair manages to surpass its predecessor in almost every aspect. The change to the two dimensions has been great.,,"Yooka & Laylee are back with a outstanding platformer. This is a great take on the Donkey Kong Country formula, but also with its own personality. If you like this genre, you cannot miss it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair neatly captures the essence of Yooka-Laylee and reimagines it as a new type of game. It's a distillation and a simplification, but it's effective. Then, as its grand finale -- a necessary conclusion that looms over the whole game -- it turns uncharacteristically punitive. It's rewarding, that much is undeniable. But it also leaves you feeling like all those hours spent beekeeping never really prepared you for the final challenge. Those bees just afford more leeway over the course of a very long struggle. It's kind of a buzzkill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
soulcalibur-vi,"Excellent single-player offering for those who aren't usually into fighting games. [Christmas 2018, p.74]",,,,,"Soulcalibur VI offers a surprisingly deep game with some robust systems laying on its impressive foundation. Here, strategy and timing is equal to brute force, making for a fighter that’s tactical, fluid, and engrossing. The game’s two lore-heavy story modes, although convoluted, serve up a great deal of content on top of the game’s PvP sections, with no shortage of additional extras to unlock elsewhere.","It’s fun, challenging, accessible and deep enough to keep this casual player around, and the few negatives can’t stand in the way of what makes the game so excellent. I’d recommend this to anyone with even a passing interest in the fighting genre, and especially to those like me who just want a fighting game that’s fun to play.",,"One of the best games in Bandai Namco's series, with a great roster of fighters and two very compelling and well-thought-out story modes with a very good character editor.

With interesting campaign modes adds to the rest of game modes, with a great roster and the creating tool gives a lot of possibilities to keep fighting. Is in the gameplay where everyone can notice than Soul Calibur VI is one of the best experiences, giving a thrilling experience for fighting fans.","SoulCalibur VI is the most dignified return to the stages of the Soul saga, which recovers the throne of 3D fighting games. With two intense story modes and solid gameplay that returns to its origins by adding new features that make it even more accessible, we'll enjoy exciting battles filled with epic nature and fun.",,,You owe it to yourself to play SOULCALIBUR VI if you have even the slightest interest in fighting games.,,,"Despite some minor issues, the soul of Soulcalibur 6 is so strong that they don’t do much to bring down what is one of the best entries in the series. The new Reversal Edge and Soul Charge mechanics add new layers of strategy and mind games while the one-two punch of Libra of Soul and Soul Chronicle will provide hours upon hours of fantastic single-player content. Beyond that, Soulcalibur 6 is just straight up fun for players of any skill level.",,,,,"Soulcalibur VI is a great way to bring back the franchise. There is a ton of content to be found and outside of a few omissions, the roster is great. Character creation leaves the door open for plenty of interesting designs. The Xbox One version had a few loading hitches and issues, but it never hindered my enjoyment. For anyone who grew up playing the original in dorms with friends, this is the first entry to capture that magic in years. The soul still burns, and it burns hot.",,,,"Back after a six year hiatus, SoulCalibur VI proves that the series has lost none of its sparkle. If this is the final SoulCalibur we ever see (and we sincerely hope it isn't), at least we can rest assured that the series went out with a bang rather than a clang.","SoulCalibur is back! Even if it feels visually out-dated, and it is, SoulCalibur VI brings many new mechanics and game modes which make it the best entry in the serie since SoulCalibur III.",,"Like all the best titles in the genre, it has a low barrier to entry and high skill ceiling. For those looking to get in a few games with friends it's welcoming and immediately enjoyable. For those committed to ploughing the depths of its systems to get tournament ready, it has plenty to unpack and understand. Better still, those that want to play alone will find SoulCalibur VI has some of the most substantial single-player content in any fighting game today.","SoulCalibur VI is an addictive and satisfying fighter, and more importantly the strongest the series has been in years.",,,,,,,,,,,I always thought that the Soulcalibur series is superior to Tekken - and Soulcalibur 6 as rather a reboot than a sequel proves my point. The fighting mechanics are among the best on this console generation. Unfortunately some lackluster solo modes hold the whole experience back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Soulcalibur 6 might not be quite as groundbreaking as past games, but it’s still a must-buy for fighting game enthusiasts or fans of the franchise.",,,,,,,,,,,"As a reboot to the series’ story, Soulcalibur VI is interesting and accessible to all players. As a fighting game, the title is just as accessible and is a quality addition to the genre as well. Though the game could use some more characters, Soulcalibur VI brings the series to contemporary gamers with its classic roster of characters, fun game modes, and robust gameplay under a fresh coat of paint and improvements. If you enjoy fast-paced, exciting combat that is easy to pick-up (and hard to master, as per usual), give Soulcalibur VI a look.",,,,,,,,"This is a very thorough arcade fighter, which offers many different fighting styles and dynamic fights. The controls are spot on and and the new gameplay mechanics are a welcome addition to the franchise.",,,,,,,,"Soul Calibur is easily my favorite traditional style fighting game, and seeing it get back to form with a solid new entry in Soul Calibur VI warms my heart, and my thumbs. Bandai Namco has taken great strides in getting the franchise back on track, and it seems all they had to do was listen to its fans. Gone are the weird and increasingly questionable combat mechanics; instead what we have is a product that feels clean, inviting, and refreshingly fun.",,,,,"If I was a more cynical and lazy person, I could have written this review in one sentence: Yup, it’s Soulcalibur. But I also happen to like Soulcalibur, so I won’t complain too much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It has depth if you want to find it, but you can also mash away for hours and still do some pretty sweet combos.

The difficulty will no doubt put people off – especially those going in blind – but persevere and there’s a deep, rewarding strategy title here that will get it’s hooks in, and drag you down with it.","Frostpunk can be overhelming and would benefit from a longer tutorial, so it’s understandable if those new to the genre find it too tricky. But a well-conceived narrative and premise makes it worth picking up whether you’re new to the genre, or have years of city-building experience behind you.",,,"Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable.",,"Evocative, atmospherically stunning, and endlessly addictive. Frostpunk is now the best strategy simulation game on Xbox One.",,"Frostpunk is another incredible title from 11 Bit Studios, and an utter triumph for the genre. It’s an incredibly unique and engaging deep dive into the bowels of the icy tundra, a textbook example of emotional storytelling through gameplay. If you can stomach it and face the cold, Frostpunk is an experience you will likely never forget.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Without skipping a beat from the original PC game, Frostpunk’s console port is a slick and efficient strategy game of misery and compromise in the coldest apocalypse.

the-missing-jj-macfield-and-the-island-of-memories,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Missing: J.J. Macfield and the Island of Memories is an evocative, offbeat adventure with a sinister yet imaginative gameplay hook. Its story suffers slightly from subpar voice acting and an eagerness to tell more than show, but for the most part this is a dark, strange and utterly compelling journey into the tortured mind of its main character, and one absolutely well worth taking.",,,,,,,,,,,,"The faltering plot twist doesn't detract from the overall experience. The Missing is smaller and more mechanically conventional than Deadly Premonition or D4, but its components remain focused on distinctly a Swery game: a dark, idiosyncratic experience that tells a deeply personal story that's as confronting as it is sincere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Besides being a fun puzzler, The Missing provides a look into depression and psychological torment. It’s grotesque yet elegant. I would even go to claim that it’s a borderline masterpiece. It leads you in one direction then turns out you were wrong the entire time. When it ends, it clicks all at once, and you suddenly want to read all the message conversations over again and play through to see everything in a different light. I couldn’t stop playing and actually spent seven hours straight playing until it was finished. I even kept replaying chapters afterward to collect what I missed. Overall, I think bold design choices were made, and we are rewarded with one of the best platformers available.",,,"It’s bit of a shame, then, that The Missing locks a poignant message behind such a tricky game, built from bricks of pain. On the other hand, all the hardships are there for a reason: to understand J.J. and what she has to go through to accept herself. A unique and powerful experience, I can tell that the game will linger long in the mind after finishing it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Missing’s clever innovations on the platforming genre are more than just gimmicks. They underline the game’s deeply emotional core and create a uniquely affecting experience. Like any Swery game, you might run into some technical difficulties, but those are easy to overlook when the experience as a whole is so fully realized. The Missing is like a dream in every sense, but it’s one that you won’t forget after you wake up.",,"This Missing is a heartfelt affirmation of identity expressed through emotional turbulence and macabre staging. Its performance as a puzzle-platformer—suspiciously slapdash and presumably exploitative—revels in instability, but finds resolution through a singular and concordant message. The Missing's pieces fit its puzzle, even if the player (and The Missing's protagonist) believe they won't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Those rough spots aside, The Missing isn’t just a great game — it’s an important one. It uses grim and upsetting content to put players inside of the mind of a troubled person, then offers them a path towards healing. It doesn’t suggest that overcoming mental and social problems is easy, but it resonates like few other things have in recent memory. I can’t say that I personally related to J.J.’s struggle, but by the end of the story, I can say that I felt her pain — and isn’t that what art is for?",,,"The Missing is a compelling, interesting and unique horror-adventure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dishonored-death-of-the-outsider,,,,,,,"Dishonored: Death of the Outsider comes just a year after the second game and even though it isn't given the numbered sequel treatment, it feels like a worthwhile final chapter to the Dishonored story arc, albeit brief in comparison. Introducing new abilities on top of the always remarkable level design is the game's strongest suit. Some small bugs disrupt the game and the last level doesn't feel as special as any that came before it. Still, if this is truly the last chapter, Death of the Outsider cements Dishonored as one of the best new franchises of the last ten years and places it among the most consistent trilogies ever seen in video games.",,"An unmissable, even if a bit dumbed down, experience for any Dishonored fan, bringing a satisfying closure to a 5-year-long arc and opening new avenues for the future of the series.","The Death of the Outsider is a fantastic stand-alone expansion that plunges us back into the dark world of Dishonored by focusing its attention on one of the most iconic characters in the series. A highly enjoyable game in each moment that inherits the best of the saga, its brutal gameplay and freedom of action, but we expected more ambition and depth in its proposal.","Dishonored: Death of the Outsider is a step forward into the right direction in the Dishonored world. Billie Lurk portrait bring us some of the most interesting themes and topics in the franchise. The game is pure poetry, and it comes in an excellent price point that every Dishonored fan or gamer should give it a shot.","Dishonored: Death of the Outsider builds on an already established foundation for both storytelling and gameplay mechanics after two main releases. This latest expansion leverages several of Dishonored 2's biggest strengths into a much more condensed form factor, without compromising on the core philosophies of its predecessors. Even after stripping out some of the complexities of full games, Death of the Outsider still has much of the substance of a full Dishonored experience.","A no brainer for fans of the series, and a great way for newcomers to see what all the fuss is about.","Fans of the universe will love the way this huge chunk of content gives you new characters and locations. However, it might feel a bit familiar at times, and it never goes into proper sequel territory. But that’s because it’s not.",,,"It was wonderfully satisfying to have more Dishonored to play, even if Death of the Outsider doesn’t quite meet the high bar Dishonored 2 set in story or mission design. Even though it’s a shorter and slightly shallower game, there are some exciting new abilities and interesting changes to the energy system, and the freedom from consequences of Chaos further encourage experimentation and freedom. All in all, it’s a worthy end to the story that began five years ago.",,,"There are times when Death of the Outsider feels a little too familiar but, despite the game’s reuse of art assets, these moments are far and few between. An engrossing, well-paced send-off for a series that already tops the stealth genre, Dishonored doesn’t get any better than Death of the Outsider.",,"Death of the Outsider is a fun, bite sized Dishonored game that opened my eyes to the series once again. I enjoyed the open-endedness of the entire experience, and while I didn’t get a lot of details of the story, it was still enjoyable and fun to see. Dishonored fans will love this one as well, and people that may have been turned off from the first game may find this one much more enjoyable. There’s still some issues with stealth and difficulty, but in the end, it’s a fun experience overall with some great options.",,,,"Dishonored: Death of the Outsider is another masterful entry in the series that in spite of its relatively slender runtime, is still a good few hours of first-person nirvana. Like Dishonored and its sequel before it, this is utterly essential.",,,"Dishonored: Death Of The Outsider is a solid, inventive, yet somewhat subdued capper to the stories from the previous Dishonored games. While the smaller scope can be felt throughout, the approach to allowing players to express themselves as a master assassin is just as strong as ever. It's uncertain where the series can go from here, but this stand-alone release proves that Dishonored is still a remarkably designed stealth-action game with much potential, that offers players the chance to be creative in ways they'd least expect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite a feeling of being watered-down, Dishonoured: Death of the Outsider is a DLC-length standalone title that provides a satisfying resolution to the franchise. Fans of the original iterations will appreciate the added content, and those who’ve been meaning to play past games can get a reasonably good idea of what the entire package can deliver.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dishonored Death of the Outsider has enough playable novelties to be attractive and helps to known the story of one of the most interesting characters in the saga.

thimbleweed-park,"Perfectly evokes the brilliant point-and-clicks of old, from the puzzles to the one-liners. [June 2017, p.77]",,,,,,"Thimbleweed Park is a strange ride. It's compelling throughout, with a strange story full of eccentric characters coupled with some very competent and rewarding puzzle construction; arguably the best of its kind, even including the LucasArts classics. It takes a while to get going and stumbles on a few points along the way, particularly with its incessant fourth-wall breaking and a lack of meaningful engagement between the playable characters. As a lovingly-crafted piece of fan service, there are few games out there that can match the level of passion and community spirit on display here.",,"A challenging and highly satisfying old school adventure, from the people who pioneered this genre. Great characters, lots of humor, brainiac puzzles and awesome pixelated environments make this a real must have for point-and-click adventures lovers.","Thimbleweed Park is a piece of living videogame history that draws upon nostalgia. Even in 2017, the game teaches us that graphics are not everything; it also shows us where we came from and that this formula is as good today as it was 30 years ago.","Thimbleweed Park is a magnificent tribute to both the classic graphic adventures of LucasArts and the pop culture of the late 80s. It promises to make you have a good time with its peculiar sense of humor and with the fantastic story that you will discover. You can not miss it if you are looking for a successful mix of exploration, puzzles and hilarious conversations.","Thimbleweed Park is a fun and challenging point-and-click adventure game. With a great noir feel, a cast of interesting characters, and tons to explore, this game is great for old fans of the genre and new fans alike. There is a ton to see, do and interact with, delivering a fantastic all-around game.",,"The story will hook you in and keep you playing, some of the puzzles will have you banging your head on the wall (or sneaking onto Youtube for a look at the solution), and the animation and personality of the characters will have you really caring what happens to them. If you never liked this type of game, this probably won’t change your mind, but for everyone else, the crazy world of Thimbleweed Park comes highly recommended.",,"Thimbleweed Park is like the HD remaster of a lost LucasArts adventure from the '80s, with all the hilarious, self-aware dialogue and sometimes frustrating design of the era brought forward into the 21st century.","You certainly get your $20’s worth out of Thimbleweed Park. The voice cast doesn’t elevate the script in the way they always did in the LucasArts “talky” days, but an enjoyable, self-referential story and hundreds of puzzles to solve make it worthy of a place on your shelf next to Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Thimbleweed Park is so much more than a nostalgic throwback. It's a distillation of everything that makes point-and-click adventures great, and a modern perfection of a classical type of game design. It's an absolute must if you are or ever were a fan of the genre. While it may be a bit too niche to bring in new fans, I'd still say it's worth a recommendation to even the most puzzle-adverse among us.",,,,,,"Thimbleweed Park is a modern throwback to the classic point-and-click adventures from LucasArts, with heavy influences from Maniac Mansion and The Secret of Monkey Island. It has an engaging story at the beginning that slowly intertwines with the various other characters to become a little more open, as there seem to be bigger, underlying issues than figuring out who the killer is. Although the game is forgiving by banishing cheap deaths to extend gameplay, it doesn't make the puzzles any easier to figure out. Thinking outside the box for illogical solutions to logical puzzles is the way to go, yet it can be frustrating and grating at times.",,,,,,,,"Overall, Thimbleweed Park is a great game which is elevated by its story rather than its mechanics. While selecting commands is a novel concept, younger players will be frustrated by the gameplay. Many will want to give up because it can take several minutes to decipher which combination of words and items work. However, the dialogue choices and quirky nature of the game may overcome that. Only time will tell.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A real pleasure for point and click lovers. It's not only superb on its own merits, but also as an homage to the great classics of the genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ron Gilbert and his team have created a wonderful piece of nostalgia, and for a few hours, brought me back to my younger days, playing on my 386 PC. For those that have the same fond memories of games of yesteryear, like Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island, it is a must-buy. Not only will the memories flood back, you will also notice the little easter eggs the developers have slipped in. For less than $30, you get a near 20 hour experience, and in my opinion, it's worth every cent.",,,,,,,,,,,"I was smiling constantly while playing, and even afterwards while writing this review, I already know it’s going to leave me with some great gaming memories, just as their other title did 30 years ago. Thimbleweed Park is full of personality, not just from its characters, but its setting, writing, and everything else that encompasses the experience. It’s clear that this was a labor of love, and there was no two better people to be at the helm of bringing back this long lost genre. “Give” your money to developers Terrible Toybox and experience one of the best point and click adventure games in decades. And as an added bonus, this is the first game in history that I'm aware of that has a setting for 'proper' rolling of the toilet paper in game. That alone is worth a purchase and speaks about its level of detail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is more than worth the price of admission, and I am glad to see it hitting more and more platforms for more players to experience the pure joy it has to offer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In the end, Assault Android Cactus didn’t meet my expectations; it exceeded them. The five zones that are offered grant a unique experience with each level and boss you face. Some of the bosses can be a bit overwhelming at first, but even with the different attacks they have, the variety of android heroes available to play as assures the player that there is something for every encounter. The different modes that are offered ensure that there is something more for the player to do after the main story has been completed and for a true competition, the game offers the challenge of earning a S+ rank on every level, requiring the player to complete every level without ever letting their combo end.

hitman-2,,,,,,"Hitman 2 is surgical – it’s a focused experience that knows what it wants to achieve and exactly how to do it, much like its protagonist. All six maps are wonderfully replayable, and in reshuffling older content, IO seems to be on the cusp of the “games as a service” wave in a way not attempted by other developers. More locations would have been welcome, and Hitman 2 feels like somewhat of a supplementary package to its episodic brother at times, but there is nothing else out there like it.","IO deserves praise for knowing their series so well and bringing the types of changes to this sequel that longtime fans will appreciate most of all. It's the most accessible Hitman to date thanks to improved information sharing, but it also runs deeper than anything before it, making it a game truly built for the fans that know Agent 47 best. No other stealth game plays like Hitman, and Hitman 2 is the best this unique series has ever been.","It’s serious if they want it to be serious, but it’s also incredibly silly if you’re in the mood for that. Which ever way you choose to play it, though, it’s consistently fun, and that makes Hitman 2 well worth checking out.","Hitman 2 feels like a slightly improved content pack over the previous game, with new missions and locations but not enough innovation or meaningful changes in gameplay. If you liked the previous game, though, it won't disappoint you providing many hours in its quality stealth sandbox experience.","Hitman 2 repeats the successful first chapter formula, but in this case, with some improvements and all the content at once. However, the feeling of being the same game, with more content, is here. New scenarios, more options, the same approach to challenging missions, multiplayer mode and more doesn’t seem to be enough to define it as a sequel. You can even play the first game directly, and also, you can buy it from the game itself. Maybe Hitman 2 seems to be an expansion more than a complete game.","The new game of IO Interactive, this time partnering with warner is a great game, with superb stealth mechanics that rewards planning over direct action, and in a refreshing way.","IO Interactive set out to perfect the assassination sandbox with Hitman 2. Though the studio fell short, Hitman 2 is a commendable stealth experience that fans of the series shouldn't miss out on. Its future now rests in whether or not its Ghost Mode and celebrity elusive targets can hold people's attention.",,"The sandbox elements, the amazing level design, and variety of gameplay options on offer are all superbly crafted and highly addictive, but I do think that fans of the previous game may well look at this more like a Version 1.5 of the previous title.",,,"Hitman 2 doesn’t add much of note to the structure of its predecessor and thus feels more like Hitman 1.5 than a full-blown sequel. But that’s not a bad thing. By offering more of the deepest, fullest stealth sandboxes in gaming in one single package rather than six episodic ones, it earns its keep. The inclusion of Hitman (2016) is a bonus for those that didn’t catch the reboot initially. Here’s hoping they put more effort into the plot next time.",,,"It might not propel the series forward by leaps and bounds, but it takes small meaningful steps that improve the formula nonetheless.","It’s a strange thing to find yourself smiling so much while playing a game that has you carrying out a series of grisly murders, but that’s exactly what Hitman 2 does. Whether you’re disguising yourself as a cupcake salesman to get close to a target, or spending an hour to make someone’s death look like an accident, Hitman 2 is the best stealth action game of the year.",,,,,"Hitman 2 is a solid follow-up to our 2016 Game of Year, delivering five huge killer sandboxes to explore to your heart’s content. Yes, the maps might not be as unique as iterations gone-by and there is seemingly fewer than normal, but boy, are they great maps. Factor in Contracts mode and the excellent Ghost Mode, and Hitman 2 is very much worth your time. Where else can you dress up as a mascot or get involved in a poisonous drinking game to take down a target? Answer: no-bloody-where!","With Hitman 2, IO Interactive didn’t take much risk. The team simply and smartly refined its formula, rubbing away some of the first game’s flaws. And it works: Hitman 2 is a generous and fun game.",,"Hitman 2 is a familiar experience, but in the Hitman world, familiarity is an incredible strength.","Hitman 2 walks familiar ground and provides the type of delightful moments you expect in the maps on offer, as well as a multiplayer mode with bundles of potential.","It’s a cliche to say one game or another is a love letter to … whatever. But after a period of time where the future of the Hitman series seemed uncertain, where its most recent predecessor felt compromised and broken apart due to the dire financial realities and constraints of the modern games industry, Hitman 2 is hard to read as anything other than a fierce love letter to fans of the series. It’s not a perfect relationship — none ever will be. But at its heart, “Hitman 2” succeeds at being the most well-realized articulation of all of the things that the series has ever done well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The lingering black humor relieves the dark subject matter (Agent 47’s deadpan delivery in disguises is so tip-top!) and no matter what, you can’t help but summon that sadistic smile you’ve been trying to hide. Granted, Hitman 2 doesn’t do much differently than the first season but it doesn’t even need to - it’s just so cool.","Though some elements are clearly still being developed and will evolve in the future, HITMAN 2 is a great example of games-as-a-service done right. Specifically, the base game is a an already strong offering that will no doubt grow into something even better as time goes by. Eclipsing the previous game in practically every way, HITMAN 2 successfully leverages strong level design, creative kills and absurdist situations to offer the best Hitman experience to date.","Despite IO’s assertion that Hitman 2 has improved AI, I don’t see it – this simply feels like new content for Hitman — and as I said, I’m very okay with that.",,,"Hitman 2 complies with what is expected of a sequel: greater and better content. IO Interactive does not try to revolutionize its formula, simply presents more killing opportunities on each map.",,,,,"Although it suffers from some framerate hiccups, Hitman 2 delivers a solid, enjoyable experience that's stacked with tons of content designed to keep you entertained for hours on end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This sequel offers plenty of reasons to revisit the world of assassination, whether you're an experienced hitman or just trying out the fiber wire for the first time.",,,,,,,,,"Hitman 2 may seem like more of a second season than a full sequel, but there’s still nothing like a Hitman game. It might not represent a massive leap forward for the series, and it might be missing some of the bells and whistles that the last game had, but it should still satiate fans of Agent 47, thanks to its more satisfying stealth and its complex, lively mission areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hitman 2 is possibly the best version of this darkly comic murder simulator we’ve seen in quite some time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hitman 2 might just be one of the best games I’ve played this year, and it was a pleasant surprise given I did not know what I was getting myself into going into this review! While it’s not without its faults, as the narrative cutscenes were disappointing, it can be a bit overwhelming to those new to the series, and some of the controls need improvement, the overall experience is fantastic. With great stealth gameplay, amazingly creative ways to eliminate your target, incredibly immersive environments, and high replay value, these elements make this a must play for both newcomers to the series and for longtime fans of the elusive Agent 47.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

control,"A stylish shooter that subverts and surprises at every turn. A little glitchy, though.

Period.","Control takes us right the other side of that door you do not remember having unlocked, to the middle of the that dark hall that you started crossing while thinking that there’s nothing hiding in the dark, specially not behind you. The dark tone and creepy setting of the Oldest House remains all through your adventure and even though you’ll eventually get enough powers to kick around any enemy you find, you’ll never get to chase away that feeling that something is not right. Control is a reminder that Remedy is still a developing powerhouse.",,,,,,"Control carries on Remedy's legacy of great story-driven adventures, adding greater freedom to the player and highly dynamic and spectacular fights coupled with a great artistic design. Definitely a game to have for lovers of supernatural plots and third person shooter-adventures.","It will not have the impact Alan Wake had in his day, but Control may be Remedy's best game in recent years. It shows the effort of the team to improve the great weakness that had been dragging in their games, the gameplay itself. Storytelling and the graphics are really amazing.","Control is a game with a superb pulp sci fi plot, that could have been a masterpiece thanks to it's level design. Unfortunately some very bad design decisions drags the game to the ""interesting but flawed"" territory.","Control's story has a great premise, but its characters leave a lot to be desired.",,"When you take into account the standout moments and combine them with brilliant visuals, some audio that is out of this world, a smattering of puzzles, a top drawer narrative and super intense gameplay, and yet again we find that Remedy have delivered the goods with their latest adventure.",,,,Control is definitely Remedy's best game since Alan Wake.

It's just a shame that a couple of annoyances hold Control back from being flawless.",,,,,,"Control is another absolute hit from Remedy, one that delivers from both a gameplay and narrative perspective. One of the generation’s most intriguing game worlds and almost perfect pacing, the only thing that holds Control back from being an all-time classic is its unfortunate and frustrating technical issues.","A really strange 15-hour experience, one that is unfortunately too linear, brings intense gunfights, psy powers, and a really great living environment that defies the laws of physics and time.","From the depth of its world-building and its gratifying combat to the unexpected twists of its story and a handful of truly unforgettable kaleidoscopic fighting sequences, this is an inspired game that manages to match its crazy, beautiful, otherworldly storytelling with action that's every bit as good.","It's not often that a game invades my thoughts the way Control has. I'm at the point where I want to consume every last thing it has to offer. And if I'm honest, it also makes me want to go back and replay Remedy's past games, too. Sure, it's a faulty metroidvania in some respects, but there are so many exceptional qualities afoot that Control handily deflects any momentary ire. I can't wait to take part in discussions about the game, to see what others have figured out, and to better understand where it all fits into Jesse's story.","Control is Remedy at its best: pulpy, weird, and immensely satisfying to play. Its setting is a potent concoction of '60s brutalist style and wacky sci-fi. Performance issues hamper the shootouts, and the characters are a little cold, but it's the setting and atmosphere that win the day.",,,,,,,,,,,"On one hand Remedy shows off nicely executed action mixing ballistic and supernatural elements in destructible environments, while on the other presenting unusual design flaws.

resident-evil-3,,,,,,"Resident Evil 3 is another solid Capcom reinvention. There’s a wonderfully tense atmosphere punctuated with an action slant that means it’s never really as scary as it could be, but it still manages to get a good few moments in. Nemesis is initially terrifying, though his best moments come when it’s a one on one fight, the encounters in the world with him tend to be brief and easily overcome. Even at it’s worst though it’s still better than the majority of titles out so far this year and well worth a look.",,,"Resident Evil 3 is a good remake with a brilliant technical production and a compelling story, but it feels a bit too linear and with too few puzzles, ending up in a limited longevity. The multiplayer experience doesn't help much too, as it suffers too many issues of youth. All in all a good experience, but far from its predecessor's splendor.","Resident Evil 3 takes us back to Resident Evil 3: Nemesis roots. Capcom leaves survival horror back and instead mixes both action and horror. But don't get it wrong, because it works. Jill and Carlos are flawless, enemies are insane and Nemesis is Resident Evil 3's star once again. Just play it.",Resident Evil 3 Remake is a necessary game for the franchise. Its focus on action and the new graphics and mechanics suit it perfectly.,"While a couple of things could've been tweaked to provide a longer experience, Capcom provides a fantastic survival horror remake that carefully balances the action with the terror. You will fear Nemesis.",,"After an explosive start, Resident Evil 3 on Xbox One quickly falls into a familiar rhythm. Having a Tyrant hunt you down is now the new norm for Resident Evil, but the most feared of all will always be Nemesis. He quickly disappears into the cutscenes however, without as much of an impact as you would perhaps hope. Thankfully though, there are enough environment and enemy variations crammed into this short experience that you never get a chance to settle down and acquaint yourself with any one enemy type, and as a survival horror game that is exactly how you want to feel.",,,"Overall, Resident Evil 3 is a wonderful continuation of Capcom’s latest remake efforts. Although its just-okay multiplayer mode falls short of the bar set by its magnificent single-player campaign, the latter does such a good job at balancing 2020 gameplay and a classic Resident Evil tone that I recommend it without reservations. Hopefully, we’ll see more classic games in Capcom’s library remade with such finesse and loving care – along with some new games, too.","Fans will certainly be happy that the Resident Evil 3 remake exists and will be excited for a potential Code Veronica follow-up, but unfortunately this adventure just wasn't as worthy of a revisit.",,"In terms of thrills and spills, Resident Evil 3 offers what is perhaps the best Resident Evil campaign ever. There's less busywork to bog you down, allowing you to move through the game at an enjoyably brisk pace. And while it is no doubt more action-focused, it's incredibly tense at times.",,,,,,"Short it may be, but Resident Evil 3 is also delightfully sweet. Or as sweet as a survival horror game possibly can be, anyway. Pared back, streamlined and completely brilliant, you'll have a blast outrunning Nemesis all over again.","Fans may not forgive some of the cuts made to the basic story, while newbies will enjoy an epic that is worth a look. Asymmetrical multiplayer mode struggles to convince.","Overall this game could be seen as a missed opportunity to flesh out what was — in 1999 — a quick but quirky followup to the more substantial RE3. But from the insane locations and intriguing characters to the stunning looks and satisfying action, this is a stellar game in its own right, and that can't be ignored.",,,,,,,,"Resident Evil 3 is a short, heavily scripted and somewhat scrappy follow up to last year's sublime Resi 2 remake. The series' trademark slow-burn tension and gentle puzzling are replaced here by all-out action that feels far too safe and linear – for the most part, a series of tightly confined corridors bookended by sloppy boss battles and chase sequences which tend to wrestle control away from the player in an effort to add unnecessary cinematic flair. There are a handful of highlights; graphically, it's the best the series has ever looked and both Jill and Carlos are decent re-imaginings of the original characters but, overall, this one struggles to reach anywhere near the heights of its predecessor. Combat feels disappointing for the most part, the Nemesis is underutilised and the whole thing is over far too quickly, with very little in the way of replay value.",,,,,,,,,,"With this remake, Capcom has greatly improved one of my least-loved entries in the series. Resident Evil 3’s greater focus on action affords you fewer opportunities to stop and think, but Jill's adventure is an incredible thrill ride. From the first moment that Nemesis burst through the wall and reached out with one of his tendrils, I felt my heart begin to race. I don’t think it slowed down again until the credits rolled.",,"All in all, Resident Evil 3 goes on to prove that the traditional Resident Evil formula, only souped-up to meet today’s needs, works better than, excuse me for saying this out loud, the first-person flatness that was introduced in Resident Evil 7 or brainless shooting action of super-overvalued Resident Evil 4 that took the illustrious series entirely in the wrong direction, only to be redeemed by these excellent remakes.","Resident Evil 3 take some more creative liberties with its source material but still comes out on top. The remake offers a more refined take on the original game to become something much more memorable. While some spirit has been lost in translation, Resident Evil 3 is superbly paced and one of the better modern Resident Evil games, and a chapter that any horror fan shouldn’t miss.",,,"Even though the remake of RE3 trips a little during Jill's last escape, the game is still a fine retelling of a classic.","Resident Evil 3 Remake does a great job of reclaiming the potential the original already had, one of the franchise's most underrated installments. Some extra modes or replayability variety would have been welcome.","The return of Resident Evil 3 manages to maintain the balance between memory and adaptation. Even if the withdrawal of certain characteristic aspects of the original game could disappoint the most avid fans, the care taken in the reconstruction of the atmosphere and of the feeling it is visible an above all, perceivable. Nemesis could have more stage time, of course, but even so its presence hovers in the apocalypse of Raccoon City, and when it finally manifests itself, it is as beautiful as it is distressing.","Resident Evil 3 is a great remake, even if not a very ambitious one. It lacks content, and it even feels like a wasted opportunity to create something bigger that expanded the original story. It is, however, a fantastic horror/action adventure with incredible visuals that builds upon the solid foundations of its predecessor, and its multiplayer mode definitely adds a few more hours of fun.","Parts of the game, such as the opening in Jill’s apartment, look positively cinematic — so textured and atmospheric one can almost imagine that video games will draw near the end of the uncanny valley in our lifetimes. If and when that should occur, I hope that Capcom will have found another horror template than zombies.",,"Like a well-oiled machine, Resident Evil 3 delivers a chaotic burst of action in a short amount of time. Capcom has done an excellent job of bringing the classic into the modern era with tight gameplay, gorgeous visuals, and overhauled character designs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It was always a long shot that a new take on Resident Evil 3 was going to be able to live up to the expectations set by 2019’s Resident Evil 2 remake, and that’s exactly the case here. Still, beyond a few examples of missed potential, this is another stellar attempt by Capcom to bring its survival horror series into the modern era and retains a sense of individuality and personality that make it stand out from its peers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Resident Evil 3 remake will appeal to hardcore fans of the franchise and those needing their survival-horror fix, but its especially short length and lack of replay value, even compared to the PS1 original, definitely makes it harder to recommend than Resident Evil 2.",,,,,,,,,,,"If Capcom continues to push these remakes out with the care and quality of Resident Evil 2 and 3, then I can’t wait to see what we get in the future. While the game still stubbornly hangs on to a few of the original’s mechanical shortcomings, the vast majority of the package is a breathtaking recreation of material we fell in love with two decades ago.",,,,,,,,,"As of press time, Xbox One X is woefully behind compared to PS4 and PS4 Pro on performance. While we lack discrete pixel-counting gear, we can confirm that both PlayStation consoles do better at locking to a 60fps refresh, and XB1X noticeably stutters in the act of play. RE3 is one of the more action-oriented entries in the series, so frame rates count.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Another great Resi remake that delivers action by the bucketload, but is somewhat lacking in replay value.","Resident Evil 3 has swapped out the horror genre for action-adventure, which makes for a short, yet highly-enjoyable campaign.

The result is a game that is not like what you would expect, but for those who want to find something to love here, there's something to find.",,"Even if taking advantage of a solid gameplay and a very satisfying open world structure, Final Fantasy XV suffers from a too patchy design, with an underwhelming second half and an uneven storytelling. It lacks balance and an unified vision, but all in all it's an entertaining game and a first step in the right direction for the franchise.","Final Fantasy XV is one of 2016's best games, and definitely a must have. Its story will catch you and make you go through Noctis’s troubles, and it is worth playing till the end to discover how all is ended. The side quests are enriching and interesting too. This ten-years-long wait has been worth it.",,"FFXV mostly delivers. While it takes some getting used to, its combat is infectious and fun. Its artwork is utterly breathtaking, and some of its set pieces are awe-inspiring. Its characters are fun and memorable, and the plot is engaging enough to keep pushing you forward. FFXV trips over its own character lore on occasion, with key details either missing or poorly explained, but it's not enough to hinder the experience as a whole.",,,,,,"Final Fantasy XV had quite a lot to live up to after so many years, and while it may have taken a decade to get here, the journey was worth the wait with this phenomenal entry in the series.",,,,,"Final Fantasy XV is a tremendous return to the franchise and includes a lot things we love about the series.

As a Final Fantasy game, it lives up to all the tropes, despite the variations it’s taken from the more ‘classic’ games. Final Fantasy XV is a title that's aimed super high, and although maybe it hasn’t quite hit the targets it set for itself, it certainly doesn’t disappoint, and is a strong enough RPG experience to stand aside The Witcher as one of the best open-world role-playing games of this generation.",,,,,,,"Only kernels of Final Fantasy’s old style remain in FF XV, which is both liberating and frustrating.

Beautiful to look at but filled with redundant and basic fetch- and kill-quests, it is too evident, that Square’s open world experience stems from MMOs.

Sure, some might find the premise absurd, as did I initially, but give it a chance and Chicken Police may take you by surprise if you give it the time to sink its beak into you.

The game’s difficulty may spike from time to time, but nevertheless, it goes without saying that Overcooked! 2 offers a robust co-op centric experience that rarely gets old, with online multiplayer to boot.","Overcooked! 2 is a Michelin Star game. As a co-op experience, there are few games better at bringing together players of different skill levels for some fun.",,,,"A delightful refinement of the first game. Overcooked doesn't add much to the mix, but it proves that when something works, why change it?","If you enjoy fast-paced strategy games, than Overcooked 2 is guaranteed to give you a good time, though I think anyone can have fun with this game due to how simple the basics are, how lighthearted the tone is, and the fact that the game doesn't really get hard until later on. People who can't multitask well will admittedly struggle, but in general, I still think Overcooked 2 is definitely a title you should pick up.",,"Overcooked 2 is simply brilliant. It comes with a massive story mode that is full of various recipe types to keep you busy, an arcade option for those wanting to hone their skills, and a versus mode which sees the very best chefs pitting themselves up against one another in a cook off to the death. All that combined means that it is a must purchase game… especially for those looking for some multiplayer madness.",,,,,,,,,,,,"A tasty dish, Overcooked 2 adds extra spice to the first game's stupidly enjoyable co-op shenanigans, with online multiplayer finally in the mix and the ability to throw food around making for even more gastronomic madness.","If you enjoyed the first Overcooked!, Overcooked! 2 is a slightly better version of that game. The online multiplayer adds some more fun, but that’s probably not enough if you grew tired of the first game. Regardless, it's a great game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Overcooked 2 is a perfect example of how to make a great sequel to a smash hit. It takes everything we knew and loved in the first game and cranks it up to 11.,"The Overcooked series is similar to that restaurant that made a name for itself with one signature dish. Not much has changed between the original game and the sequel, but the recipe has been honed to reduce frustration and make it easier to chew.",,,,,,,"An outstanding co-op game that is better than the original in almost every possible way, but still offers a short campaign and isn't a good single player experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A new and improved recipe for family fun. [Issue#204, p.70]",,,,,,,"Overcooked 2 is better than the first game, but yet again, there is room for improvement.

fifa-18,,,"Despite an uneven evolution on and off the pitch, FIFA 18 manages to muster enough innovation and improvements to make it a worthy iteration of the franchise with a fleshed out Journey mode, the interactive transfers, and the real motion technology as its most juicy contributions. While the unbalanced action on the pitch and some abandoned modes constitute the most glaring weaknesses.",,,,"FIFA 18 offers the best game of football that the series has seen in some time and provides the best overall package for fans of the sport. It might not be up there in terms of authenticity with PES on the pitch, but this year's release has made up some ground, excelling at providing those wow moments that gets fans of the real sport on their feet and punching the air. With an interesting return of Alex Hunter, new game modes to try, and a level of presentation and detail that can’t be found anywhere else, FIFA 18 is easy to recommend to long-running fans of the series and is a solid jumping in point for people who might have skipped a few years.",,"Even if not revolutionizing its formula, FIFA 18 introduces many new features improving playability, variety, online options and graphics. It's definitely the highest point reached by the series so far, even if still not perfect.","FIFA 18 does everything FIFA 17 did, but better. The Return of Alex Hunter is a much-improved version of last year mode and turns out to be a must play for everyone who owns this game. Visuals are stunning but gameplay is still the king on the best game of the most played sport of the world.","This new title offers us the FIFA experience we know but also brings new features such as its renewed FIFA Ultimate Team mode, which has achieved the perfect balance to fit any type of player. Alex Hunter's new campaign, online modes and single-player modes make FIFA 18 one of the best games in recent years.",,,"Is FIFA 18 the best in the series? No, but there’s a whole load of things to do once you’ve embraced all the gameplay enhancements to ensure it’s still a decent game.",,,"Ultimately, FIFA 18 introduces enough new ideas to suggest it’s not sitting on the laurels of its success. However, it’s a simplified experience, one that fails to embrace the complexity of football at the highest level. Its focus on attack makes for spectacular matches, but they often feel like extravagant offensive training sessions than a proper match with depth and strategy.","While there are often many years that sports games phone it in, FIFA 18 doesn’t feel like one. From head to toe this game is both dripping in style and substance with so many compelling game modes its really just a matter of where should you start. Wherever it is, soccer fans will find very little to be disappointed in this year.",,,,,"FIFA 18 is what many folks wanted FIFA 17 to be. Overall, it's the best soccer game money can buy right now.",,,"FIFA 18 has come out fighting this year, with an improved game of football, another chapter in its excellent story mode, and more besides. It's still not quite there yet, failing to deliver something as fluid and immediate as it could be. There's ample room for improvement, sure, but FIFA 18 is still a genuinely marvellous footie game.",,,"It's off the pitch that EA excels. From the variety of game modes on offer and how everything's presented, to the constant updates in FUT's Team of the Week, Daily Objectives, and discussion of real-world happenings in commentary, FIFA 18 captures the world of football and confidently translates it into a video game. On the pitch, however, EA's soccer series is still lagging far behind PES 2018's more fluid, satisfying football.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"FIFA 18 improves across the board and continues to offer an astonishing amount of options, without comprising on quality.",,,"Despite promising ""the greatest leap in gameplay in FIFA's history"", FIFA 18 is a product quite similar to FIFA 17 in which there are small improvements, but not major revolutions.","FIFA 18 is still a spectacular rendition of ""the beautiful game"", but also a step back in the series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"FIFA 18 is a solid game, with everything that made FIFA 17 an instant classic, plus a deeper story mode and a few additional bells and whistles. But it’s not the huge step forward that FIFA 17 was, and it suffers from some areas lacking the polish that EA could have easily applied, considering that it did all the hard work of building a foundation for a killer soccer series last year. That said, if you’ve been waiting to get back into soccer sims, FIFA 18 is as good a place to start as any.",,"There was nothing outright “wrong” with last year’s product, but there was room for improvement. It seems EA Canada was receptive to what could alter things for the better, as many beneficial changes proliferate 18. Gameplay feels much more natural and welcoming, equating to more accessibility. The ways to play are well thought out and varied, adding to replay value. And the garnish of presentation scores big, leading to a pleasant sensory experience. If you like soccer and video games, give this serious consideration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In the end, FIFA 18 isn’t a tremendous, leaps-and-bounds improvement over FIFA 17, but EA Canada did fix what matters most — the on-field gameplay. While the other modes either stay the course or take a melodramatic dip downward, ultimately FIFA 18 shows that EA Sports is aware of the competition breathing down its neck, and is willing to make the necessary changes to regain the throne.",,,"While the changes across the board make for a better game than last year, there are still cracks that need cementing, not papering over. Evolution, not revolution this year for FIFA, then, but still a fine game fit to burst with things to do.",,,,,,,,,,,"FIFA 18 is simply magnificent. Streets ahead of what came before, and continuing its dominance over its rivals, EA has done a superb job. With huge improvements across the board, this is the game FIFA fans have waited five years for. While the offline offering may continue to lack the depth of NBA 2K18, but the continued improvements each year have culminated in a brilliant game this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While FIFA 18 may not excel in every area and has some issues on the pitch, the game offers great value and something for everyone. The story mode is excellent, career mode is improved, the online suite of features is especially strong and everything surrounding the pitch such as the visuals, presentation and atmosphere work to enhance the moments that make the sport so exciting.",,,"FIFA 18 is probably the best football simulator right now. Although it is a little bit iterative and still has some issues with the goalkeepers, this game is more polished than ever, it has amazing graphics and a soundtrack that fits perfectly the game. FIFA 18 also has the official licenses of most of the great football leagues, which is wonderful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sonic fans will definitely love it.","Sonic Mania is one of the best Sonic games ever made. The hedgehog is as fast as always and the level design is, in a few words, awesome. Classic taste for one of the best games of the year.","Sonic Mania is Sega's love letter to his iconic blue hedgehog and the fans that have come since the 90's. It's more than a remaster, it's a completely new game developed with mastery that mixes the best of the Sonic Saga, alongside some extras for 1 or 2 players that'll keep us doing loops for a long time.","If not for the clumsiness of the new moves and the hair-pullingly hard bonus stages, it would be a perfect game. But Sonic Mania is still a long, wonderful return to form for the series that fans and newcomers alike should enjoy. Hopefully the upcoming Sonic Forces can maintain this level of quality, like Sonic deserves.",,This is how you do a Sonic game.,,,,,,"A Sonic fan couldn’t really ask for more than what’s been delivered by Sonic Mania. It’s got the gratifying Sonic physics, responsive controls, thrilling speed, open levels and brilliant bosses. It truly is a return to form for our favourite speedy blue hedgehog, which is ironic considering that it’s not made by Sonic Team.",,"Sonic Mania is the Sonic game fans have been wanting. It hits all the notes (and problems) the originals had. But it is also why the series has remained relevant for so long. It delivers speed, fun, and chaos (no pun intended) all in one package. It also finally removes the stigma that all Sonic games are terrible. Let’s hope Forces is as well polished and enjoyable as Mania is.",,,,"A beautifully crafted love letter to Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Mania is everything a Sonic game should be and more. I'd be deliriously happy if SEGA carried on making them like they used to; if it carried on making more games like Sonic Mania.",,,"An excellent 2D platformer, Sonic Mania goes beyond expectations, managing to be not only a proper evolution of the series' iconic formula, but the best Sonic game ever made.",,,,,"As a synthesis and expression of a specific era of Sonic, Sonic Mania is devout toward its inspiration, for devout fans of Sega's beleaguered mascot. If more of what Sonic is what you want, then this is very much that, but more, and bigger, and faster. But for me, as someone with fond memories but key criticisms, Sonic Mania seems content to paint over some of the series' problems rather than fix them, making for a game that falls a little short of what might have been.",,,,,,,,,,,"By going back and looking at what made everyone fall in love with the series in the first place, Sega was able to deliver the best Sonic game in ages. It's a long-lost relic from an alternate history where the franchise got one more great Genesis game. While a bit too caught up in its past, it's undeniably amazing how well the core gameplay still holds up today. Sonic Mania is a fast and fun platformer that should not be missed by any fan of the series or anyone who just enjoys a good side scroller.","A return to the series' roots in every sense, Sonic Mania is a joyful reminder why the franchise became such a hit in the first place. Though it's content with reliving past glories, it does so exceptionally well. Exciting level design, a stellar soundtrack, and cool expansions on the original formula work in one accord to deliver the Sonic game fans have been waiting for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"I could go on and on about Sonic Mania but what you need to know that it’s a must-buy for any Xbox One owner. The title, despite its slight issues, is one of the best games available on Xbox One and elevates the franchise. The developers understood what made the past entries so great and built upon that. Sonic is all about speed and this game dishes that out by the bucketload. You should get it right now because I can’t recommend it enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Great mix of retooled old stages and new ones, still with the same feel and replayability as the classics. Sonic Mania is everything that Sonic The Hedgehog 4 Episode 1 and 2 hoped to be and then some.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sonic Mania is what fans of the blue hedgehog have been wanting for years, as it is a return to what made Sonic who and what he is with lighting fast 2D side scrolling action and some new levels to blast through. With some bragging rights on the line, SEGA has thrown into the mix the Time Attack and Competitive modes which will add some replay value for some of the serious Sonic players out there.

The cover-based combat just feels so much better now than I remember it. Not sure if that has to do with the rock-solid frame rate or just the passing time, but this game is sublime. Pulling off stylish actions feels natural. The sliding mechanic just works, and makes combat more fun than most cover shooters. This is a game that has stood the test of time and somehow works better today than it did ten years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,"In terms of a clean, simple release of two classic games at a fair price, playable this smoothly at this high of a resolution on modern consoles? It’s hard to complain. If you’ve ever wanted to play Bayonetta or Vanquish on your current-generation console, or have yet to pick up the PC releases, this is a great excuse to do so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"These are two very fantastic games that need to be played by action fans. Bayonetta is the star of the show with its flawless execution and Vanquish is a damn good game, but its slowdown in its cutscenes keep it from being a flawless upgrade. Either way, this collection is a great representation of the best that Platinum Games has developed. If you want to see their best work, then look no further!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,If you have a fondness for no-holds-barred action games then playing Bayonetta and Vanquish is a must. These suckers may be 10 years old but they hold up beautifully and even rival most modern AAA games.,,,"The Bayonetta & Vanquish 10th Anniversary Bundle isn’t a sexy release by any means. Besides the nice steelbook that the physical version of the game comes with, there’s not a lot else included in this package other than the expected slight boost in graphical prowess. This collection will surely please both longtime fans and new ones who have been looking to give both of these titles a shot, but it’s hard to say that there is anything else all that alluring included here. This is just your pretty standard, run of the mill remaster of two great games – nothing more, nothing less.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you haven’t player either Bayonetta or Vanquish, now’s the best time.

Surely some issues like not so good music, long loading times and weak user interface are somehow annoying, but when compared to positives, you will not mind them.

The sheer carnage on display as you smash and crash with your fellow racers is quite the sight, especially in the destruction derby style modes. Those looking for a racer with a little extra edge will no doubt find it here.",,,"Wreckfest brings back its FlatOut roots with an heavy and destructive racer, but leaving behind some good features like the destruction-fueled Nitro system.

Fierce, frantic fun.",,,"It’s fun playing games like Forza Motorsport and Horizon, but Wreckfest offers something that they just can’t: carnage.

Still, there is some improvements to make on the AI and Online side.",,,,,,,,,,,,"While not a fan of the racing genre in general, I do have my moments when I would like to just smash into someone else’s car (in a totally victim-free virtual environment, of course), and Wreckfest hits the spot perfectly. By comparison with what other games attempted in the past, I have to say that it is a true masterpiece and has pretty much taken the crown as the best title in a rather unexplored game sub-genre. So, gear up, tune up your car, rev your engines and try to make it to the finish line with a number of wheels that is higher than 1!",,,,,,,"The video game market is filled with racing simulations, and it’s nice to see oddities like Wreckfest that deliver the exact opposite. Why race a clean path when you can race dirty?

It features a great handling model that's sufficiently deep and rewarding to master. The wild and dirty races tend to be quite enjoyable too. Of course, the chaos can sometimes become frustrating. There are few things worse than getting knocked off the track at the last possible moment. It's even more agonizing when it's not entirely your fault.

[Aug 2018, p.80]",,,,,"Forgotton Anne houses a gorgeously fitting art direction that’s not too dissimilar to Laputa: Castle in the Sky. This design sits extraordinarily well with its carefully crafted platforming and puzzle elements, collectively putting forward a wonderful adventure that never loses its grip. The dialogue may well be hit and miss at times, but the overarching plot is captivating, well paced and thoroughly entertaining.","Those who already enjoy anime in both its art and its typical sensibilities will likely adore the game. Others who may have avoided anime to date but enjoy a story-driven adventure game should not overlook it either. Its premise is strange, but always charming and engrossing too. Issues with controls and platforming hinder the experience, but not enough to sour all the good that is present, like subtly branching storylines and a host of memorable characters. Anime fan or not, you won't easily forget it.",,"A fascinating interactive anime, with an adult story, satisfying gameplay and great art and sounds. Some bugs and imprecise controls show it could have been refined more, but it's definitely a worthy experience and one of the most interesting adventures released lately.",,,,,"Forgotton Anne is a lovely looking game, with the constantly moving art really impressing as you advance on the adventure, creating a world full of interesting characters. The story starts slow but comes into its own as you delve deeper, with sadness, humour and joyful moments all part of the experience lasting over six hours. Capping it off is a beautiful orchestral soundtrack that is often relaxing and never feels out of place.",,,,,,"Forgotton Anne’s gameplay, then, is fairly standard. But coupled with the gorgeous visuals and storytelling, it becomes something worth remembering.",,,,,,"A nice surprise, Forgotton Anne is an endearing anime-style platformer that doesn't deserve to go to landfill.","Forgotten Anne isn’t revolutionnary in any way but still, it finds a good balance between narration and gameplay and brings the player in a unforgottable journey.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Forgotton Anne is slow and clunky and a bit frustrating at times, but it has its heart in the right place when it comes to story, which challenges the player morally and concludes with a satisfying choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A beautiful platform adventure with gentle puzzle solving and a strong anime influence. Highly recommended.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, Forgotton Anne is a phenomenal addition to any gamers collection.

A new Modern mode in addition to its Retro mode makes it even more accessible for everyone.",,"It feels like Crash 4 is stuck somewhere down the middle in terms of Crash games; way off the lofty heights of Crash platforming at its peak in Warped, but well above some of the stuff that followed the original trilogy. Does it try to introduce too much? Maybe. But then in a weird paradox it doesn’t do much more to bring the franchise to modern consoles. Much like the plot of Crash 4, it is unsure which time period it is in.",,,,,,"There’s a lot holding Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time back from being the leading platforming experience it could be.

But it is a beautiful-looking game, and fans of the series will undoubtedly get a serious kick out of being back in control of Crash – even if they will need god-like patience for some of the game’s more trying sections. Its extra content is a let-down though, and the full RRP for a game that most players will be done with in around eight hours leaves a big question mark over whether Crash Bandicoot 4 is a worthwhile purchase.",,"Crash Bandicoot 4 is a game that has been a long-time coming. Toys for Bob have really captured what made the original games special, while also modernizing it and delivering their own stamp on the franchise.

It looks and sounds phenomenal, is a touch more lenient, injects some new mechanics and takes much more care with the delivery of its story and characters. Given how poorly previous attempts to update Crash have turned out, this is a marvellous effort that should please old fans, their kids, and those just looking for a brilliant if potentially gruelling retro platforming adventure.","Even more so than playing the N.Sane Trilogy, which literally remade the original Crash games from my youth, playing Crash 4 felt like getting back in touch with the series. It's an injection of new ideas into now-classic gameplay that surprises and delights, even as it feels like a homecoming. Truly, games like this are why we come running back to long-dormant franchises with open arms.",,,,,,,"Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time is an excellent modernization of a decades-old franchise that was beginning to really show its age.

What has also made the jump (no pun intended) to this sequel though is the difficulty and control issues of the past. I really do wish the game was more accessible to new and younger fans alike, as some people may be turned off by this, but I don’t think it’s fair to heavily penalize the game for this fact, as it still is what made the series what it is.

dirt-5,,,,,,"DIRT 5 is superb and will quench the thirst of anybody who believes racing games have become too sim-heavy and boring. Some will lament the lack of true rallying and the ostentatious Americanised presentation but why complain when you can fully embrace the arcade richness on display here. Simply put, DIRT 5 is excellent and will leave you craving for more – now go out and there and drink it up.",,,,"Throughout this year we have seen so many racing games, but all of them try to be realistic driving games in circuits. Codemasters and DIRT 5 has taken advantage of this lack of arcade racing games to bring one of the most impressive velocity experiences of this year. The action becomes part of races in an extensive experience with so many race modes, circuits, vehicles and a complete tool for creating and personalizing as you want. Really, DIRT 5 seems to be a breath of fresh air to the racing games space this year.","DIRT 5 takes off-road racing to another level. The game is 100% recommended, and comes with Smart Delivery to enjoy it on Xbox Series too.",,,"DIRT 5 on Xbox One isn’t the best DIRT title there has ever been but it definitely deserves a place in the line-up. Just involve yourself in the racing, forget about the faff, and you’ll be sure to have a jolly good time.",,,,,In DiRT 5 you will find the right mix between adrenaline and fun. Codemasters has managed to bring the saga back into the spotlight.,"DIRT 5 is one of the most joy-inducing racing games of this generation. Nothing quite compares to hurtling around a muddy track in an exotic locale, using the handbrake to get the back end out around sharp corners and trading paint with opponents as you fight for positions, all while navigating bumps and breath-taking jumps. The dirt being thrown up by tyres realistically accumulating on your vehicle until it’s a mess only adds to spectacle of it all. This is a showy game, but one that also has perfectly-honed physics, making it challenging but accessible to all. And while some of that magic is lost when you make your way into Playgrounds, the sheer creativity it offers is more than enough compensation.",,"DiRT 5 feels like a game that is built to showcase new hardware. Still, if players stick with the frame rate mode it works just fine on the last generation as well. I cannot wait to dig in once I get my Series X, but even on One X this game is truly a looker. The game play feels fantastic, it just feels like a game that will showcase better on more powerful hardware.",,,,,"The big disappointment comes from the lack of inventiveness of the title, whether in the course of the career or in the articulation of the modes of play. The body of DiRT is rather nice this year, but the engine needs a supplement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dirt 5 isn’t at all the game I thought it would be. Far from a clinical rally sim, what it is is a simple, fun off-road racer that has a big personality. While it doesn’t dive too deep underneath the hood, it still tears up a huge number of tracks across a great number of race types—it does more than enough to keep players firmly in the driver’s seat.",,,,,,"Dirt 5 is a great racing game with tight controls, tons of content and fun multiplayer. It needs some polishing to get rid of minor technical issues, but overall, it’s a great experience.",,,,,,,"Overall, DIRT 5 fixes everything that was iffy about the prior entry and does so in a way that breathes new life into the long-running series. DIRT 5 has smoother controls and more versatile framerate options than prior entries have had – at least on consoles – and the addition of non-position objectives helps makes races more replayable and a bit more fun since you may have to step outside of your comfort zone, or more accurately, increase your comfort zone over time, to fully embrace it. DIRT 5 clicks with the player faster than any prior entry and is an absolute must-play for anyone who has loved the series before, or who hasn’t and wants to start fresh. There’s no better rally racer on the market than DIRT 5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dirt 5 wants to be an immediate racing game, accessible and devoted to pure fun, at the cost of sacrificing a realistic driving system and embracing a physics that is at times hyperbolic and saucy.

Too bad for a fluctuating technical sector lacking in terms of optimization on consoles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dirt 5 is an excellent rally racer offering plenty of race modes and car classes to choose from. The Career mode is engaging, and the presentation is gorgeous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dirt 5 is a content-rich, diverse arcade racing game that is unlike anything else among racing titles of this year. Codemasters’ new direction in the Dirt franchise might not be what veteran off-road enthusiasts would’ve expected. Still, Dirt 5 accomplishes its mission of expanding to a broader audience with engaging arcade-y gameplay, and sets the series off on an exciting new path.",,,,,,"Dirt 5 continues Codemaster's tradition of creating some of the finest racing games around that have neither the words ""Gran,"" ""Forza,"" or ""Speed"" in the title.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Although Dirt 5 is very different from previous entries in the series, it’s still a great racer that embraces its arcade approach with a vibrant art style, fun game modes, and joyful gameplay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"A new studio in charge sees Dirt retain some of its old swagger in a fun, frequently beautiful but occasionally hollow arcade racer.",,,,"Dirt 5 feels like a game designed for the new generation of consoles, but there’s still plenty here for those not upgrading in the short-term. Whilst it has some technical issues and frustrating AI, the driving is as solid as ever, Playgrounds is a great new addition and there are some genuinely stunning moments to be experienced. It’s one of the best rally games in recent memory and I can’t wait to try it on a new platform.",,,"Every console generation has to begin and end with an outstanding racing game, and this is the one for Xbox One/PS4 and PS5/Xbox Series. DIRT 5 is a fast & furious game with a fun twist on its style and gameplay. May not be as deep as the DIRT Rally Series, but proves to be much more varied than them while playing alone or even playing with you friends locally with a 4 players split screen mode or online.",,,,,,,,,,"All in all, it's playable and enjoyable; however, the game will need some more content and definitely more bug fixes in future updates. In other words, it's not entirely polished. Although it may not be polished, it's highly recommended for arcade racers, no doubt about that. If you've been on Forza Motorsport or Project CARS 3 before, then this might be something for you. Great track layout and astonishing graphics makes the game special. Dirt veterans may also recognise the similarities between this and the older games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nba-2k19,,,,,,,"NBA 2K19 continues the series' decade-long trajectory of becoming the very best sports sim in the world. That's certainly still true on the court thanks to improved gameplay mechanics that fix trouble spots, a genuinely interesting and well-written story mode, and quality of life additions across the board. Sadly, the series still feels like something less than it should be thanks to predatory and invasive pay-to-win tactics that make their shameful return. Hopefully the day will come when this player base revolts and gets the game at least down to cosmetics-only buying options.","I still think this series has some ways to go to get back to the very high heights it once achieved. While 2K clearly learned from last year, they had to fix so many problems that they still have some ways to go before they can truly call themselves the standard for sports game. But it’s important to look on the bright side: NBA 2K19 shows that none of last year’s problems broke the game permanently, and there’s hope for the game to return to its former glory sooner rather than later.","NBA 2K19 further improves on an already perfect formula, adding more realism both visual and in gameplay, and offering us a wide choice of modes. This is the game to have not just for basketball fans, but for every sports game lover.","NBA 2K19 is the best basketball game of all time, a must have for all NBA fans.

Everything seems real, from the way the players move and communicate on the court, the TV presentation and even the player mannerisms; it is just stunning. The abundance of customisation that is offered with almost every game mode makes for much replayability too and the only thing that lets it down are those damn microtransactions.",,,"For many, basketball is more than just a game, and NBA 2K19 doesn’t take that lightly. It throws every resource it has into the theatrics of the sport, creating charismatic presentation, a well-written story mode, and strong core gameplay. The series’ persistent weaknesses are still apparent in areas like the transition game and ludicrous microtransactions, but there’s so much variety to how its extensive MyLeague mode plays out that there’s always a reason to look forward to the next game of basketball.",There still isn't a better alternative when it comes to video game basketball.,,,,,,,,"Another superlative iteration of video game basketball with very few flaws, NBA 2K19's biggest problem remains in its implementation of those pesky microtransactions that threaten to eclipse everything the game does right. Look past that, and NBA 2K19 is still unsurpassed.","NBA 2K19 has a better career system than previous entries in the franchise with improved defense mechanisms and more intelligent gameplay. Beside some deja-vu feelings about the content, it delivers a great experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With the pressure from NBA Live mounting, Visual Concepts outdid themselves on the court, while the cinematic part of the career mode is the best in years. Unfortunately the impact of microtransactions on the career and development of the player is still felt - although the grind to get virtual currency in-game has been reduced.",,,,,,,,,,,,Year after year 2K shows how it's possible to improve a product which is near perfect. Jaw-dropping graphics and realistic mechanics combine to make NBA 2K19 the best sports game on the market.,,,,,"The on-court action of NBA 2K19 has never been better, and the new Takeover system adds a fresh wrinkle to the gameplay. However, the continued presence of microtransactions continues to bog down the otherwise overwhelming amount of content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NBA 2K19 had a real opportunity to learn from last year’s mistakes, and in some ways it did. The Neighborhood is more convenient, the Prelude is way more interesting, and the gameplay has seen some subtle but important improvements. Unfortunately, all this is marred yet again by the game’s predatory microtransaction system, which turns the MyCareer stuff into a grind-heavy, pay-to-skip farce.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For every step in the right direction, NBA2K19’s price tag keeps it from being a truly outstanding installment in the 2K series.","When actually playing basketball NBA 2K19 shines, the action on and around the court feeling as authentic as a video game can achieve. The ebb and flow of the game comes through masterfully whether in exhibition or in a deep playoff run. The ancillary parts of the game have their moments of greatness too, but those can be overshadowed by the constant shaking of the virtual tip jar. I enjoyed the heck out of NBA 2K19, don’t get me wrong, but man do I wish the letters VC weren’t as heavily involved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a game that is in need of some patches and, hopefully in future installments, adjustments that make the online interactions more enjoyable for people who do not want to grind endlessly or pay extra cash.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NBA 2K19 is as complete a sports video game as any ever made, and only its aggressive monetization tactics hold it back from being considered one of the greatest.

It’s definitely a worthy investment for Rally fans, especially if you skipped last year’s WRC 8, though I’m not sure it’s worth upgrading straight away if you’re still plugging away at that title. At least not until a good sale comes along. While it does have some multiplayer modes, at the time of this writing I was unable to find any open lobbies. But to be fair most people probably prefer the career mode, because you really aren’t racing head to head anyway.",,,"WRC 9 pushes forward KT Racing's series with a deeper and satisfying managerial aspect, a great car feeling and top-notch audio. It only gets dragged down by not too satisfying graphics and lack of meaningful visual damage, aspects we hope will be improved in the future.","WRC 9 is a logical evolution. It offers the same rally experience with the official license of WRC, giving a simulation experience, and it is not a game for novice racers. Improved physics, dynamic weather, and the career mode offers more to fans, but without important changes.","WRC 9 is a little bit continuous from the previous edition, but it is undoubtedly overflowing with quality for another year.",,,"For fans of the genre, WRC 9 is a very good facsimile of what it must be like to run a WRC team, but for those of you who want their rally driving to be more enjoyable and less like being mugged, then DiRT Rally 2.0 is where the smart money goes.",,,"WRC 9’s incredible stages make it easy to recommend to series first-timers, although it's not a huge leap from WRC 8.",,"WRC 9 is the best chapter produced so far by the French team Kylotonn Racing, improving a very solid career mode and innovating the multiplayer.","With the addition of the new Clubs mode, this is the most competitive entry in the series yet, and it’s also the biggest thanks to the three new rallies that have been introduced.

An incredibly tactical game, with a great artistic design and a surprising plot. A real must buy.",,,"For anyone who grew up with a love of action movies, Superhot's value can be found in the concept alone. The game has managed to capture the choreographed combat of classic action movies and implement this into an interactive scenario. Superhot is among the best indie games available on the Xbox One, successfully executing a unique and innovative idea.",,,,"A puzzle game dressed like a twisted, Cronenberg-inspired shooter, Superhot's methodical, slow-motion approach to the genre is as cerebral and deliberate as it is unhinged.",,,,"Those who view the story as a prelude to the many hours that can be spent in the game’s Endless and Challenge modes however, completing speed runs, seeing how long they can last against a constant stream of enemies and beating levels only using swords for example, will find a game with as much longevity as it has originality.",,"I wanted to love Superhot more than I did, but its simplistic design and lack of variety really hurt it, even with its short campaign length.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Absolutely essential.,,,,,,,,,"It seems a bit paradoxical that SUPERHOT simultaneously plays exactly like every other shooter you’ve ever played and nothing like them at all, and yet, this is the case.

It’s dark and stylish-looking, with a rich and interesting progression system – and the cycle of slaying, looting and upgrading is as compelling as it is in Diablo 3. Given the price, it’s hard not to recommend. Grab some friends if you can, then join the trail.","Without question, Path of Exile is a great, if not one of the greatest, values for dollar you can find on the Xbox platform at this very moment. Grinding Gear Games has demonstrated that you don't need to spend $60 and up on a game that is going to be shelved in a matter of weeks as you wait for more content to arrive. Despite a few hiccups, Path of Exiles is a pure joy to play, and with a quality microtransaction system in place (Editors Note: I know, who knew we'd say something like that), it's worth every single penny to play this game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It ends earlier than we'd wanted though, leaving us with more questions than answers.","Little Nightmares could be a horror tale created to scare a child. Given its unique atmosphere and design, I’m sure there will be plenty of adults who will have nightmares about this game. And that’s all I want in a horror game.","A piece of art with a stendhalian beauty for those who love the horror genre. Much closer to Spirited Away than the burtonesque aesthetics, Little Nightmares is a terrifying experience that challenges our inner fears.",,,"Little Nightmares is a well created, superbly executed affair. I’d prefer it to be longer and I have to admit to not only being disappointed, but also shocked, at its short length. In fact, unless you’re going back through things for a second, third or fourth time, just in order to pick up all the collectibles, then chances are you’ll be done with the five chapters and then everything Bandai Namco and the development team at Tarsier Studios have given you in no more than a few quick hours. I guess the price reflects that though and when something is so good, perhaps it’s best to keep it at an enjoyable length. If you’re after a tense game that will have you questioning every little moment from start to finish, then Little Nightmares is most definitely for you.",,"At times mechanically clumsy, but artistically sound, Little Nightmares might get on your nerves every once in awhile, but its imagery will burrow into your brain and never leave.","Like Hide and Seek, Little Nightmares confidently captures the exhilarating fear of waiting to be found by something that’s hunting you. But it also replicates the alien horror of being a child that doesn’t understand what’s happening to and around them, and of a seemingly familiar environment turned into a series of opportunities for safety and danger. Smart, grotesque and never-endingly weird, this is a very different, extremely welcome kind of horror game that left me wanting more than its brief five hours provides.",,,"In all seriousness, Little Nightmares does a fantastic job of pulling off “childish horror”. It strikes a good balance in introducing horror without ever being too scary; anyone who loves a little bit of the macabre without the intense dread of true terror will love this indie title. It is a bit on the short side, taking me only a little over four hours to beat – and that was with me getting stuck twice – but what it lacks in length in makes up for in brilliant content. If you enjoyed the likes of Limbo or Inside, you’ll be sure to fall in love with the world featured in Little Nightmares. With its brilliant setting, wonderfully whimsical characters and clever puzzles, it’s hard not to recommend it as yet another essential title from what’s shaping up to be an incredibly stellar year of gaming.","While Little Nightmares might not scare your pants off, it will definitely get your heart racing. The game’s mix of incredible art design and enjoyable gameplay create a memorable game that gets better with each level. While Little Nightmares’ long load times will hopefully get patched out currently, they make exploring a lot less desirable. Puzzles in the game could be better, but its main gameplay elements come off very thrilling and fun.",,,,Little Nightmares is a freshly scary experience that feels like a gothic storybook come to life despite some technical hiccups and awkward controls.,"Little Nightmares is surreal, supernatural and odd, but it's great too, its ending equally weird and disturbing, the whole thing will leave an indelible mark on your brain. And that's exactly why you should get it bought.",,,,,,,,,,,"Unique Burtonesque art direction could not avert my attention from the fact that Little Nightmares is one of the poorest platformers I’ve played in years. [07/2017, p.43]",,,,,,,,"Little Nightmares is dark, eerie, startling, gross and sinister – all without resorting to M-rated content or a first-person camera. It's a great puzzle-platformer that is amazingly atmospheric, where the scariest parts are a fun gameplay experience rather than a game-halting fright. In many ways, it reminded me of Inside, but I have, to be honest: despite being a little more rough around the edges, I like Little Nightmares more.",,,"Little Nightmares is based entirely on its visual appearance but at the same time it couldn't exist as anything else but a game. Unfortunately, it's the insecure practicalities of the gaming mechanics that somewhat detract from an otherwise sublime performance. Full of subdued innuendo, Little Nightmares is like a demented puppet show or diorama, somehow lifelike but at the same time disturbingly artificial. It certainly doesn't look like your typical game and is a nightmare worth experiencing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Little Nightmares is a thrilling and interesting horror game that feels fresh and creative with good puzzle design and a rich universe inspired by our childhood fears.,,,,,,,,,,"Little nightmares is a very good game. The story of Six is a quick one, but you gather everything you need to know as you move along in the game. Think you can brave your childhood fears? If so pick up Little Nightmares and learn about Six’s story.",,,"Little Nightmares is a beautiful, clever, and at some points breathtaking game, that is only let down by a few minor frustrations.",,,,,,,,"Ultimately, Little Nightmares strikes a fine chord between charming and creepy in a way that perhaps only a former LittleBigPlanet developer could do.",,"The older I get, the more I want to play games like this.

a-plague-tale-innocence,"The story never lets you settle – it never guarantees the safety of Amicia or Hugo – and, even as some of the mechanics grow a little stale, that keeps A Plague Tale feeling breathless across its 12-hour runtime. [Issue#178, p.88]",,,,,"A Plague Tale: Innocence is grim, dark, and constantly provocative, and yet, it effortlessly manages to remain emotionally radiant throughout. This isn’t just another survival game, it’s a tale that consistently and articulately interlaces beauty with brutality to excellent effect. Whilst the gameplay could have benefited from a bit more depth, the overall journey is mechanically well balanced, and to its credit, unlike anything else. This, is a must have.",,"The story isn’t terrible, to be fair, but as I said, it’s built around a girl escorting her mostly useless little brother through peril after peril. Even after he gains a few more abilities later in the game, it still doesn’t make for the most compelling gameplay. On a similar note, you’ll really need to enjoy skulking in the shadows and running for your life if you want to get the most out of the game — which, to be completely honest, I just don’t.","Asobo Studio's new game is a rare gem, with a solid stealth gameplay and a touching and exciting storytelling. Maybe something more could have been done in the enemy A.I. and replayability areas, but it doesn't prevent it from being one of the most interesting games around.","A Plague Tale: Innocence is a refreshing take on stealth, riddles and RPG elements. Amicia and Hugo's story is well written and, as characters, they show one of finest and strongest relationships in videogames. A Plague Tale: Innocence mixes perfectly fairy tales, death, Plague and 14th century hardness. Just enjoy one of the best AA games of the year.","A Plague Tale: Innocence is an intense story of powerful narrative that engages from beginning to end. The endearing charisma of Amicia and Hugo fuses with a very effective gameplay that blends stealth with action and riddles, resulting in a novel product, pampered in detail, and impeccable artistic direction.",,"If you don’t mind being “kicked in the dick”, narratively, while having your hand held through gameplay, and utterly enjoy mood, even if it is sonically amplified gloom and dread, A Plague Tale: Innocence does deliver.","A Plague Tale: Innocence delivers a brilliant story, innovative mechanics and truly immersive gameplay. Yes, the whole dying and repeating exercise occasionally borders on the the fine line of annoyance. But when you consider the visuals, the audio and the experience as a whole, I would highly recommend this journey into the past.",,,,,,"An adventure game at heart, A Plague Tale: Innocence expertly fuses storytelling, stealth and action to form a coherent, flowing and altogether gripping experience that's hard to put down.",,,,,,,"A Plague Tale: Innocence brings a really good balance between narrative design and game design. The duo, well written, explores a rich universe during 14 to 15 hours of infiltration, puzzzles and tense sequences.",,"One of my favorite moments is when Amicia spots another wildflower in a lone trek across the city, nestled among the decay of the rats’ revolting nests. Without her brother around, she picks it up, and places it gingerly in her own hair--a personal reminder to keep trudging on amidst the hardships, and a testament to her growing strength and tenacity. Despite flashes of predictability, moments like these will bring a lump to your throat, as it did mine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A Plague Tale, at times, feels like a missing early chapter of the Assassin's Creed catalogue. Its ability to bend a truly fascinating point in documented history into a fantastical, mythical story that keeps you invested from start to finish is remarkable. It's a cinematic journey that is uncomplicated in its delivery, managing to occupy gamers without distracting from the game's narrative and the bond that develops between the de Rune siblings which, in the end, is A Plague Tale's undoubted strength.",,,"I was very pleasantly surprised by A Plague Tale. Don't let its setting or theme cloud your judgment and keep you from playing this game. It's a fun and rather unique game, and one that will compel you to keep playing it until you reach its end.",,,"A Plague Tale is a beautiful but dark adventure, about fear, death and love. It isn’t perfect, but it doesn’t try to bite more than it can chew, and delivers an experience where nothing feels redundant, and absorbs the player from beginning to end.",A particular strength of the game is that it alternates between perilous action and periods of reflection where the characters process the changes they’ve observed in the world and in themselves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A lot of people are probably going to sleep on, or not even know about, A Plague Tale: Innocence—and that’s a shame. It’s a gripping, touching, emotional, yet at times horrifying experience, one that feels quite unlike almost any other game out there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A Plague Tale: Innocence is a flawed yet thrilling adventure. While we love the characters and mostly enjoy the stealth sections and combat, the game is just too linear and limited; “walk there and do that – or die”. There is little room for exploration, no challenging puzzles and just a handful of fights that will test your skill. However, if you like the premise and don’t mind the linearity and lack of challenge, this game might still be well worth your time.","A Plague Tale Innocence is an intense and beautiful tale of Amicia and Hugo De Rune, about bonding and surviving. The solid story of the game combined with the nice level design and gameplay, make for a solid adventure.",,,,,,,,,"A compelling plot, grounded characters who aren't instant heroes, crafting and upgrades without arbitrary levelling and some beautiful environments to solve your way around.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Asobo Studios needs to be applauded for creating something so stunning and fantastic in every way. It’s not easy to make you care about characters in a short dozen or so hours, and the fact that A Plague Tale will be etched into my memory is no small feat.

A remake that could pass for a modern game thanks to the visual magic of Toy for Bob.,"Spyro Reignited Trilogy is an excellent remake of the originals. It's a lot of fun to play and looks stunning. Unfortunately, the lack of a 60 FPS option, even on the Xbox One X, and the awkward camera controls in some levels detract from the experience. Despite these issues, the remake pays homage to some of the best platformers ever created, and it's evident that developer Toys for Bob spent many years crafting this package.

Minor frustrations regarding traversal to the side, this is a perfect example of meaningful innovation.","The beautifully drawn and wonderfully composed Yoku's Island Express is another nice addition to the Xbox One's library of platformers. There is a ton to unlock and collect on the island's large map, which is rewarding and fun to explore, although the size of the world can sometimes lead to problems. But while the mashup of pinball and platforming is enjoyable to play, players aren't going to see anything in Yoku's they haven't already seen from either genre.",,"Yoku's Island Express is a small, highly creative, indie gem.

This is my personal arcade highlight so far this year.,,,,"Yoku’s Island Express is a highly compelling mix of genres. Its pinball is fantastic, and its world is full of fun things to do. Through brilliant game design, this odd combo is merged into an inseparable, cohesive whole. The blend is not perfect, off-balanced in a way that will likely appeal more to pinball aficionados than fans of more classic Metroidvania fare, but still does justice to both genres. For the first shot at this unique idea, it definitely hits the mark; Yoku’s Island Express is so fun and charming it’s impossible not to have a blast.","Yoku’s Island Express critical path can be completed quickly, and there could definitely be more meat on that bone, but it’s a journey I urge every pinball and Metroidvania fanatic to play.

From the redesigned Kick Off mode to the Journey’s conclusion, there is a lot of game here.

That said, this is as good as FIFA has ever been.",,,"FIFA 19 reaffirms the series' strengths, even if some smaller problems, like not so real-like player models and a bad commentary keep it from reaching a better score. It still holds strong thanks to very good and even more refined gameplay, new licenses like UEFA Champion's League and the Italy's Serie A, a more accessible FUT mode and a great soccer feeling overall. Definitely the game to have for soccer fans.",FIFA 19 is a step forward from FIFA 18. The UEFA Champions League was a fan-requested add-on that they can finally enjoy. Gameplay has been improved and new game modes have been added that are meant to be enjoyed with friends.,FIFA 19 follows in its footsteps year after year to enjoy another title of the most complete football simulator on the market.,,"This year’s FIFA sees a variety of notable changes to the formula, and makes for one of the better iterations of the series in quite some time. While most changes aren’t necessarily game changing, the introduction of the UEFA Champions League and Europa League licences are most certainly going to change the landscape of the series for some time to come. And while The Journey is fairly disappointing and FUT continues to dominate micro-transaction discussions, FIFA 19 is still an excellent package for football fans, and is well worth giving a crack.","FIFA 19 is basically the Paul Pogba edition of the series, focusing on creating excitement, showing off and trying to ensure every match is full of memorable moments… the problem is it’s all a bit much at times.",,,,"EA still has some tricks up their sleeve on the gameplay front that can continue to make FIFA an enjoyable, albeit complex, sports sim.",,,,,EA has gone to great pains to incorporate their new license into the title and it shows from the game modes all the way up to the game’s tagline. Champions Rise and so has this franchise to the occasion.,,,"While Kick-Off's party games in particular are a highlight, FIFA 19 improves upon last year's outing in almost every department. One of the best football games around, FIFA 19 delivers the most fluid and fun entry yet, and is the kick up the backside the series needed. Back of the net.","Fifa 19 is a game that aims to please the casual public more than the expert one. By including some fast new moves and by redesigning some game modes, EA brings more dynamism to the formula.",,"It's promising that EA is listening to its community. FIFA 19 is much more responsive on the pitch than last year, and the company continues to evolve FUT to keep it fresh. However, the lack of progress in Career Mode and Pro Clubs is sorely inadequate. Thankfully, The Journey's continued entertainment, FUT's long-lasting nature, and some inventive new Kick Off modes mean I'll likely still be playing FIFA 19 by the time next year's game rolls around.","FIFA 19 is the finest playing game in the series.

That, of course, doesn’t apply to people who just want to play soccer and don’t care much for other sports. That’s okay, because this is definitely a good soccer game.

It’s a gorgeously crafted adventure that’s jam packed with detail, endearing characters and a memorable heart warming story. Rarely do we see platformers donning such care and attention to detail, further upheld by fluid well rounded gameplay that doesn’t let go once it captivates you. Owlboy is a must have.","A romp through Owlboy's beautiful zones brings back wonderful memories of platformers of the past; however, make no mistake, the game is modern-day. But without its incredible presentation, stunning visuals and charming music, Owlboy would be devoid of anything special. When it comes down to the gameplay, Owlboy 's companion-heavy experience isn't horrible, but it's not groundbreaking either, and the sections that control badly are more memorable than those that don't",,"A fascinating platformer, with great 16-bit environments and lovable characters. Its fighting system could have been better refined with a more even difficulty and tighter controls, but it's definitely one to play.","Owlboy is one of those games that draw a smile on the face of the player. The art is great and soundtrack is beautiful (and remind us to another classic videogames like Final Fantasy and The Legend of Zelda). Mechanics are so simple, but it's funny. It's a little piece of art.","Owlboy comes to demonstrate to indie development how with patience and good work, a long development, no matter how long it may be, can end up in a good port. A polished and simple gameplay, charismatic characters and a story that goes beyond the epic.",,,"With its gorgeous pixel-art visuals, the charming cast of characters, the enchanting soundtrack, and the smooth platforming, Owlboy certainly delivers an engaging experience from beginning to end. If you’re looking to scratch that nostalgic itch or even if it’s your first time jumping into a pixel art style game like this, Owlboy is a game you will not regret playing.",,,,,,,,"Owlboy is a wonderful adventure that hits the right notes. Dropping in at the sweet spot of ten hours this game delivers on almost everything it sets up. The mechanics feel fantastic, the bosses are genuinely fun to take down, and the characters are wonderfully fleshed out. This is one game that borrows from other genres and does it right. It is hard to stand out in a sea of me-too games, but Owlboy manages to do it in spades.",,,,,,,,,,"Despite an unsatisfying final act, Owlboy is an enchanting and dazzling adventure. The heartfelt tale will tug at your heartstrings, while the solid gameplay will make you want to see Otus' journey to its conclusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Owlboy is obviously a labor of love, and not some cold and calculated syndicate product. Altogether, it would have needed some outside help to do doctoring, especially to the latter half of the game. In the end, Owlboy is true to its inspiration: a retro-platformer both in good and in bad. It’s a shame that it couldn’t grow beyond that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s beautiful, it’s fun to play and it’s accompanied by some wonderful music, but it’s the way that the narrative of loss and failure, of hope and redemption is inextricably woven into the game that makes it special.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Owlboy is a solid title that's filled with a vast, beautiful world and characters you'll come to love.

Best of all, this story makes you think about Batman’s storied history as much as it wipes the canvas clean to tell a new tale with faces you’ve never seen before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"I’m finally getting a sense of direction from the narrative, although I’m sure Telltale will find some way to surprise me.

soma,"One of the best and most disturbing horror stories you'll play on Xbox One.

That’s not to say that it isn’t scary, on the contrary it’s very unnerving and full of unsettling sights and choices, it’s just not up to scratch when those aspects try to go hand in hand.","SOMA is so deserving of high praise even as it's difficult to do so with specifics and not spoil the excellent story. Simon's journey through PATHOS-II ask a lot of questions that it demands players answer in their own terms, both in-game and long after. Even as it's often dystopian, the central themes and questions surrounding SOMA are worth mapping onto today's world. They are questions that may always be relevant. Who are you? What is the self if not an illusion? SOMA is a good horror game that does most things well, but more than that, it is an exceptional science fiction tale that no genre fan should miss.",,"A thrilling and highly compelling first person sci-fi adventure, with some very deep themes and great storytelling. It could have used some more optimization on the base Xbox One, while on the X it runs very smoothly.","SOMA offers a really good, believable and disturbing story. Despite its gameplay failures, it's worth playing.","SOMA is an horror adventure, but most of all it's a drama. Some characters and dialogue can be strikingly perturbing.

It’s burned its story and themes into my brain, ironically enough, and while I forgot little bits here and there, I was shocked at just how much the game has stayed with me all this time later. I could go on and more in depth but our other review has readers covered. Like re-opening and reading a great book, or re-watching a fantastic movie, Soma retains its strong story driven focus and themes it transpired through videogame format and I still have just as much admiration for it as I did on release, and it still gets the same score it originally earned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Frictional Games delivers on yet another horror game that leaves us at the edge of our seat and quivering in fear. Even in a new science fiction setting, SOMA still brings to the table the exacting polish that its predecessors have in the past. If Survival horror is the game for you, or if you’re just looking for a game to test your bravery, this is exactly what you’re looking for. If you're still confused about the game, just think Dead Space in a Bioshock setting without all the fancy weaponry, but with all the fantastic atmosphere. You're welcome.",,"A gripping mix of survival horror and existential science fiction storytelling, which is notably improved by an optional new safe mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With such a heavy focus on the atmosphere and the terror, SOMA seems to forget to include much in the way of puzzle solving for progression.","For players intrigued by SOMA but hesitant to jump in due to the sneaking and hiding, there’s never been a better time to try it.

Ultimate Edition reminds us of why Gears of War is so beloved.,"A visual upgrade to an already great game, Ultimate Edition is a must-have for any shooter fan.","Gears of War: Ultimate Edition reminds us of the good and bad sides of the original.

Thanks to its excellent feel, wide range of characters, and excellent soundtrack. With the return of the original composers in addition to new artists, the music here shifts between modern renditions of classic tunes to experimental techno and even some bass music. Not everything feels as timeless as the original soundtrack and the modern flourishes can feel out of step with the decidedly simple design.

The gameplay, though, isn't deep enough and doesn't offer any replay value even if still worthy of being played.","Is easy to be satisfied with The Sexy Brutale, especially because it’s a breath of fresh air due to its innovative ideas. Also because discovering all the secrets the manor conceals is satisfactory and amusing. Is because of all this that we forgive its possible flaws, although we retain a certain sensation that the game could have been something bigger and more important.","Like playing Clue with Hermione's Granger Time-Turner, The Sexy Brutale is an unusual graphic adventure that'll delight the genre fans and newcomers alike. The indie game that you cannot miss until you wait for RiME, the next project of Tequila Works.","This is a gorgeously executed murder mystery puzzle game where there's more than meets the eyemask. The main story is further fleshed out with collecting guest invitations and finding 52 playing cards, giving you an ever greater reason to leave the guests to their fates for a little longer. The puzzles are wickedly difficult, with the perfect amount of obviousness that will have anyone kicking themselves for thinking within the box.",,"The Sexy Brutale is definitely one of the more original ID@Xbox games that we’ve seen recently.

Worthy of your time, indeed!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time with The Sexy Brutale. It’s been a long time since I felt the desire to replay a game past completion to find every collectible and every secret, but the game is so intriguing it’s almost addictive.

Shadow of the Tomb Raider does all of this and more, its exhilarating predatory combat the icing on the cake.","Better-crafted platforms and Tombs built around more interesting puzzles, the title unfortunately loses a slight foothold when it comes to telling its story or fully immersing the player.","Dark and dirty but also full of fun and discovery, Shadow of the Tomb Raider is rife with jungle mysteries, embellished history, gratifying puzzles and Lara Croft's personal struggles.

When you get inside this world of puzzles and perils, nothing is going to detach you from the screen, because RiME catches you.","An elegiac odyssey to come back home.

I do wish the game would come to more consoles and PC as it is currently only available on Switch, but perhaps that is a future plan. As it stands Switch owners who grew up with the originals should definitely check this out, if you don’t have nostalgia for the series though, this game might just feel like yet another difficult platformer that has yet to get with the times.",,,,"An endearing and impeccably-made reboot of a Capcom classic, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection not only looks really good, but it doesn't compromise on any of the aspects that made the original so special.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It’s really too bad that Capcom didn’t take this chance to add online co-op to the game since it would have worked well for a console known for its online play.

Not having played a hockey game seriously in almost two decades it feels like a really good place to step in. There is a lot to unpack here, and I had fun with more than one of the modes. It also has a great training mode for those like me who want to dig deeper into the ins and outs of the sport. EA may not tout this game as much as their other sports games, but they should. This is yet another quality pillar in the EA Sports library.",,,,,"Generous content is the great strength of NHL 19. Unfortunately, it's not sufficient to overcome the lack of new gameplay mechanics or the graphic render and animation system, that would gain a lot from a switch to the Frostbite engine.",,"NHL 19 succeeds mainly because of its best-in-class controls, authentic presentation, multitude of different ways to play, and its overall excellence in capturing the essence of hockey culture. The pond hockey mode is a fun new way to play with friends in beautiful outdoor environments, but it's the only brand-new feature, and that may disappoint veteran fans.",,,,,"It’s been a while since a sports video game genuinely surprised me in a positive way, but EA Sports managed to do it with NHL 19.",,,,,,,,,,,,"NHL 19 still has its share of legacy issues that need attention, but the vastly improved skating and physics make this the best playing hockey game of the generation.

For the rest, it really depends on how you’re planning to play it — grab it if you’re planning on a lot of online play (read: and you’re based in North America). If you’re sticking to offline, bide your time and wait for a sale. Kudos to EA Vancouver for doing what they could all the same.","NHL 19 is somehow both great and a bit disappointing. Sure, this is the best hockey game yet, with an almost impossible amount of depth. This is the kind of game you can play all year and still not feel like having even really scratched the surface. It is good sit down and play for a couple of hours or just jump in for one game and then head out to do something else, but at the same time, this barely feels like an upgrade over last year's version or the year before that.

The World of CHEL adds a much-needed layer of personality, playability, and lightheartedness to the franchise.

If you were put off by NHL 18, which felt lazy, then NHL 19 is the apology you deserve. If you skipped NHL 18, then this game will be an even bigger leap forward for you. If you’ve never played a hockey game before, you can feel assured that the ponds and stadiums of this game will be accommodating.

tom-clancys-the-division-2,"A seriously accomplished looter shooter, with plenty to do on day one.","The second entry in The Division series has improved greatly in almost every aspect, and can be easily considered as one of the best multiplayer role playing titles ever, and the experience could have been just flawless if not for the weak story and some enemy AI issues.",,,,"The Division 2 feels like a watershed moment for the loot-shooter sub-genre. Its mechanics are solid, its performance is great (aside from some minor glitches and bugs), and its content is bountiful. These things make it a rarity in the genre, an outlier from games that launch half-finished and limping from patch to patch and DLC to DLC. The Division 2 is the new gold standard for games-as-a-service – D.C. really is lovely this time of year.","Ubisoft has taken criticisms to heart, and made changes that capitalize on the series' potential in ways the first game never did. Their approach to this title should be considered a success on many fronts, with their main downgrade from the predecessor coming in the form of a lackluster main plot and forgettable characters. Technical issues and instances of poor AI shouldn’t be ignored either, but they’re outshined by the superb gameplay improvements that include meaningful optional content, a deeper well of skills and gear, and a more level playing field in PvP. The Division 2 has something here for fans, critics, and newcomers alike.",,"The Division 2 improves on the previous game in many areas, especially gameplay and end-game content, managing to feel always captivating and never boring. Too bad for the skinny and unsatisfying story, while the PvP section and modes needs more refinement and balance.","The Division 2 is not a radical change, but it is that little twist that the game needed. It's a much more complete game than its first installment in every aspect. Starting with the content, but also, and not less important, by how well integrated are this time almost all elements: progress, gameplay, endgame...","The Division 2 is probably the best looter shooter of this generation of videogames. Its addictive gameplay, the large amount of content and a tactical AI make it indispensable.","The Division 2 sets the standard for visual quality on Xbox One X. Moody lighting, evocative weather effects, and painstakingly-detailed environments have pretty much become Ubisoft's calling card, and they're all the more impressive when you consider how Division 2 increases the stakes...Early on, The Division 2 feels very similar to the original game, but the small improvements look as though they could help the franchise realize the potential largely missed by The Division when it launched in 2016.","The refined combat, improved AI, and other elements overshadow any detriments and lingering bugs. The Division 2 is not only a refined follow-up, it’s the arguably the best ‘looter shooter’ this generation has seen.","The Division 2 is very much like the first game of the franchise. The gameplay feels familiar, but there are noticeable tweaks and additions to all the modes on offer, all of which are for the best. I’ve had a blast playing through it all in co-op with a friend, but it’s certainly different playing on your own; far from terrible but you’ll need lots of willpower.",,,,,,"At times, The Division 2 does just feel like more of the same but with a new setting, but when it’s pulled off this well, who cares? In developing The Division 2, Ubisoft has taken what worked from the first game and listened to fans, creating a follow up that’s captivating and densely packed with things to do. If you like third-person shooters or love loot, it’s a must-buy.",,"For what it’s worth, The Division 2 is a fine game. It’s finely tuned, looks gorgeous in 4K, plays like I would have hoped, and just takes a great idea and improves on it. Co-op is the way to go, and solo players will still have some fun with it, but it will be a more difficult romp. Massive has shown they listened to their fans and wanted to make a game that the players wanted to see and they did just that. It’s a great shooter, great RPG, and well worth the time for anyone looking for a rewarding adventure.",,,,"The Division 2 is almost certainly a step up from its predecessor, offering more content than you can shake a stick at and enough tweaks to make it feel somewhat fresh. While Massive has attempted to rectify the issues of the original, it hasn’t quite managed that yet: yes, enemies are still kind of bullet-spongey and the missions can get quite repetitive after a while, but aside from that, The Division 2 is an impressive follow-up, building upon what was already a solid foundation.","For those who finished the first Division game, this second episode will probably lack some new and exclusive features. That being said, The Division 2 is definately a great game that mixes polished gameplay and a huge amount of content, especially for the end game.",,"The range of enemy types continues to keep combat encounters challenging, the equipment I earn and pick up continues to feel different, valuable, and asks me to consider new ways of play. The ravaged environments continue to intrigue, and sometimes they're so stunning I find myself needing to take screenshots before I move on.",Shooting the bad men and tinkering with your loot in The Division 2 is good enough to keep you coming back to something that’s regularly monotonous and lacks any real message.,,,,"Tom Clancy’s The Division 2 is a huge game. I feel its sprawl in the time it takes to run the length of the National Mall in Washington. And yet it all loads and runs like a dream, making this a technical achievement as much as an artistic one. There are no wheels being reinvented here, no new ground broken, but all of my complaints about the first game are addressed and improved upon. And Tom Clancy’s The Division 2 is just fun piled upon fun, sometimes despite its ridiculously serious tone, often because of it. [Polygon Recommends]",,,,,,,,An accomplished but rather tedious and macabre game.,,,,,,,,,"The Division 2 may be making a mess on Tom Clancy's grave by betraying his highly conservative values, but what is here is a very competent and polished third-person open-world action game with a big emphasis on co-op. The value in this package is seemingly nigh on endless with the amount of things to do and see. Even the core gameplay loop, though simplistic, is satisfying enough to keep things stimulating, even when they feel monotonous at times. Just when things feel the most tedious, the end game content really mixes things up in a big way to reinvigorate the formula.",You'll certainly get a lot of bang for your entertainment buck with it.,"The Division 2 does not introduce a massive revolution in its formula, nor does it pretend to be on, given the good taste in our mouths that the first one left. It more than meets the ""more and better"" expected of a sequel.",,"The Division 2 is a huge game, full of content and things to do. The best part of it is that, thanks to its excellent gameplay, you’ll enjoy every single mission. The missions themselves could have better design, and things like the matchmaking are far from perfect, but overall it’s a great ‘shooter looter’.","For me, The Division 2 is little more than a cornucopia of hyper-detailed shooting galleries. I doubt I’ll keep up with it as it’s updated with new content since I inevitably grow bored of open-ended shooters with weak narrative hooks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As a first step towards a future of more live service content, The Division 2 already feels amazingly complete. It works from day one, its various systems are staggeringly deep and its combat is in a class of its own. Everything else that’s still to come over the next couple of years? That’s a satisfying cherry on top of an already massive sundae of excellence.",,,,,,,"Not only is The Division 2 a solid gaming experience, but it's one that Ubisoft plans to continually support over time. We've already seen the beginning of that support, and there is no indication that it'll let up. Whether you are a solo player or someone ready to jump in with a squad of friends, The Division 2 is a game you don't want to miss.",,,,,"As someone who plays this genre more than any other, there is too much that The Division 2 does right to ignore, and it’s doing it right from launch, which is a mountain of points in its favor. I have sunk in 60 hours in a week and a half and I have no plans to stop playing any time soon. This is a big win for Massive, Ubisoft and players themselves.",,,,,,,,,,"The Division 2 is a safe but overall well-made sequel. Although the most noticeable difference compared to the predecessor might be the shift from winter to spring, there have been several improvements that do a lot for the gameplay - not the least in terms of combat. Liberating Washington is also just as fun and rewarding today as it was to help New York three years ago. If you want a more down to earth online action game, The Division 2 is the game for you.",,,,,,,,,,"A triumphant follow-up that sets the bar for the looter-shooter. There are some teething issues, but The Division 2 is an incredibly polished product, and downright compelling at the same time.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Outside of some terrible soundtrack music and gameplay mechanic hiccups, The Division 2 is everything you hope a sequel should be. In today's world it's rare to see a sequel deliver a better experience than the original. The Division 2 does just that. So, to sum things up, buy the game. You can thank me later.",,,,,"Whatever frustrations and let-downs fans of The Division suffered, their patience has been more than repaid with The Division 2. With new, free content scheduled for release throughout 2019, and considering Ubisoft’s recent track record with keeping releases like Rainbow Six Siege and Ghost Recon Wildlands fresh for years with new content, I wouldn’t bet against The Division 2 being a thousand-hour game for dedicated players. The Division 2 is surely the game that fans of The Division wanted to play and that Massive Entertainment wanted to deliver the first time around.",,,,,,"The Division 2 is better than it has any right to be. Considering how well everything works with one another, it is hard to not overstate how much this game does right. This is what “games as a service” games are supposed to be. Sure, it has the launch hiccups of its predecessors and that one mission that I loathed, but it is loaded with so much content that is both fun and challenging. The Division 2 is the litmus test for loot shooters from here on out and I will surely be playing more as its free DLC starts rolling out.",,,,"Sure, The Division 2 isn’t perfect. Those hoping for an in-depth and engaging story will find themselves extremely disappointed in the meager offering on hand here. But, if you can overlook that, you’ll find an amazing experience beneath that is just teeming with engaging content. Considering how easy it is to sink 60+ hours into the game and still have activities to complete, I’m confident in saying that Massive Entertainment has earned themselves a giant gold star.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Borderlands 3 has only pushed the bar higher and I can only commend the entire development team on creating yet another fantastic game.,,,,"Borderlands 3 brings back the overwhelming funniness and simple but addictive gameplay the series is known for, even if Gearbox played it safe taking little risks in innovating the game, thus making it feel a little bit older.","Borderlands 3 is just what we have been waiting for.

Tons of new loot, missions, challenges and a renewed gunplay that not only we think it is the best of the whole saga but also one of the best shooters of this generation.","As satisfying as it is for longtime fans, it's still accessible to newcomers so that nobody is left out of the fun.","The core feel of classic Borderlands action is enough to carry you through at least one play-through of Borderlands 3.

I know I will eventually, at least I hope so. As it stands right now, the game is a hard pill to swallow. It has the makings of a great loot driven game, but it’s missing a few key ingredients to make it a great first play through to level up. If they can fix the loot drops, have the performance not fall over dead in areas, and maybe clean up a few bugs, it will be a great entry in an already well done franchise. Until then, for anyone that hasn’t picked it up yet, I say wait until we get a couple of patches.",,,,"Is Borderlands 3 the best one yet? Not quite, but it's incredibly close. While it may not eclipse Borderlands 2, Gearbox has crammed Borderlands 3 with more chaotic gunplay, more ridiculous guns with which to wreak havoc, and more silly humour. More of everything, then? Yep. Borderlands 3 is one big bundle of fun.","Borderlands 3 doesn’t take much risk and doesn’t evolve much either.

The lore is intriguing, and the few characters you meet weave compelling narratives. Still, there remains an unshakeable thought that this game is a beautiful painting, but with an askew frame.

The shortage of ammunition and cures, the enemies yelling at you when you cross any door, the disturbing scenarios or the story told in the purest Evangelion style, are points that only add positively to this title. While not all that glitters is gold, combat is easy if you have enough ammunition and inventory space is rather a nuisance. Having said all this, I can only recommend Signalis to all those lovers of classic Survival Horror, those who enjoy convoluted stories that make you think and for those who want to have a heart-wrenching time without having a heart attack along the way.",A real indie gem inspired by the best survival horror classics.,,,"Signalis punches above its weight in almost every aspect.

I've enjoyed many horror movies and books that don't scare me because I like the subject matter, the settings, the characters, or some other elements of them, and the same can be true for games. Signalis isn't a scary horror game, but it is a memorable one that borrows from the past while helping secure a future for games like this--and the small but talented team, with any luck. For me, atmospheric, tense, and creepy are adequate stand-ins for true horror, and Signalis has plenty to offer along those lines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In an era that survival horror gaming seems to make a strong comeback in the AAA sphere, “Signalis” offers an unexpected, near perfectly crafted, old school experience that fans of the genre should not miss.",,Signalis is a love letter for the classic survival horror genre and that kind of fear and sci-fi mix that never fails.

It’s therefore also a huge shame that it’s let down by repetitive and annoying puzzles that have the player run back and forth in identical corridors, a painfully limited inventory and an unimpressive combat model. Fans of old school horror games and space sci-fi should still find Signalis an interesting experience, and those subscribed to Game Pass can try it day one on the service.",,,,Developer rose-engine’s debut is a near masterwork in a much-missed mode of horror gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you’re a fan of the previous games then this is a must buy for your collection; it is bright, noisy and frantic and I wouldn’t have it another way.",,,The successful transition from exotic locales to America’s backyard makes me excited to see where the Far Cry formula goes next.,"We didn’t get it with the last two entries in the series, but Far Cry 5 feels like the generational leap that fans have been waiting for. This installment certainly feels like the biggest in terms of content and it just might be the best Far Cry game to date.",,"While you're not likely to remember its story in a few months' time, and the erratic driving of friendly civilians may frequently alarm you, its gameplay shines and that's what's important. Setting you free in a stunningly realised open world, Far Cry 5 gives you all the tools you need for tens of hours of outrageous fun. Factor in online co-op and the user-generated content of Far Cry 5 Arcade, and you have one hell of a compelling package.",,"The biggest take away from Far Cry 5 was the fact that it was just pure fun. The missions were both fun and entertaining, the visuals are fantastic, and the shooting is refined and on point. Fans of the series have more than likely already picked this up, but if you remotely enjoy first person shooters, this is a must own. It’s not perfect, but it tries its best to be and you know what? It got close.","If you’re a fan of the Far Cry series, Far Cry 5 is a definite must-have. The gameplay is familiar, but there are shiny new features that are a blast to play with.","Far Cry 5 improves on a well-established formula by adding mercenaries and removing many of the chores that defined its predecessors. The game is incredibly fun to play, but its story is lackluster and its uneven pace prevents it from reaching its full potential.",,"From its tense opening to its blistering conclusion, Far Cry 5 is another cracking instalment in the series, streamlining some of the hunting elements and putting co-op up front for both the campaign and the bottomless Far Cry Arcade. The narrative and characters will live on in the memory once you're done and dusted too, as will the insane random minute-to-minute moments that always succeed in making Far Cry so unique.","This fresh take on the Far Cry franchise is clearly visible content-wise, but a tad more discrete on the style. If you're not bothered by the slightly repetitive formula, you'll enjoy the many strengths of this episode.",,"Despite some brief irritations and missed opportunities with its narrative, spending time in the world of Hope County remains absolutely delightful.","In its quieter moments Hope County is a picturesque backdrop to terrific Prepper Stash puzzles, and an over-the-top fantasy playground when the volume is turned up. Taking on Eden's Gate is compelling, horrific, and an awful lot of fun.",,,,,,,"Far Cry 5 is exactly what you would expect from a Far Cry game and not much more. It does the open world really well, but the bland story drags it down. The game touches a sensitive subject, but doesn’t have guts to actually say something and couldn’t convince me even for a minute that what’s happening could be real. What the franchise obviously needs is a new beginning, a leap of faith Assassin’s Creed Origins was brave enough to take. [05/2018, p.56]",,,,"Visually it is mostly stunning and while the antagonists are highly charismatic, they are also very one-dimensional. Mechanically on the other hand the series takes a few steps in the right direction but the main story missions aside there is nothing that its predecessors or the Just Cause franchise haven’t done before. But even that could be forgiven, if there would be an ounce of either believable or challenging AI behaviour could be found.",,,,,,,,,"It takes the Far Cry blueprint and expands the highlights while changing the sliders on aspects that became overused to craft not only the best Far Cry game, but one of the best open worlds to explore this generation, whether alone or with a little help from a friend (or AI dog).",,,"Far Cry 5 is as good as we were hoping it would be, offering a great campaign with plenty of freedom and things to do, a satisfying narrative and surprising multiplayer options through Far Cry Arcade. A pretty complete package.",,"Far Cry is back with yet another great adventure. Far Cry 5 is stunning, fun, has tons of content and a lot of care has been put into every single aspect of the game. The only thing missing is some innovation.",,,,,,,"Far Cry 5 is a breathe of fresh air for the Far Cry franchise. Ubisoft’s open-world design continues to evolve in mostly positive ways, granting players more freedom than ever before while presenting more engrossing story and side missions with memorable NPCs to help keep the gameplay loop from getting repetitive. If you’re a fan of Far Cry or first-person shooters in general, Far Cry 5 is an easy recommendation.",,,,,,,,,,"Far Cry 5's story is a real let-down, but the action still makes for a solid co-op experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Ubisoft has crafted a brilliant open-world shooter, but the company has also presented a subversive take on the hero's journey that is both engaging and disturbing. Most importantly, it's a game that makes you think, which is something you don't often see.","It is too stressful to be enjoyable, it's world too dangerous to safely explore, it's story too dumb to take seriously. [June 2018, p.112]",,,,,,,,,,,"But if you’re looking for an insight or two into the sociopolitical troubles currently haunting the country in which Far Cry 5 is set, best not to get your hopes up.",,,,"Far Cry 5 offers a breathtaking adventure with solid shooting action, a living and appealing world to explore and a convincing bad guy. The addition of co-op is great and Far Cry Arcade makes this a package that every shooter fan must play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Should you find yourself wanting to plow straight through to the center of cult activity and really stick it to the Seeds, or slow down your pace assisting every Tom and Nancy you come across, Far Cry 5 has got you covered. Whether you want to play online with a friend and have a laugh or two in a goofy custom map, or get down and dirty with the local country folks, the choice is up to you. After all, this is Far Cry, and this is Hope County, Montana. You’re about to have a hell of a time.",,"Playing Ubisoft's Far Cry 5 is just like eating a McDonald's Big Mac. It's really appetizing but never surprises me. I already know what it tastes like before actually biting in, considering all the Big Macs are made by the same recipe.

the-evil-within-2,"A gripping, well-told horror story held back by occasionally awkward handling.",,,,,,"The Evil Within 2 doesn't reinvent the survival-horror genre but makes it work in more of an open world. Blending it with the tightly directed sections we have come to expect from the genre creates a fantastic horror setting that cranks up the tension only when it's needed. Players are rewarded for exploring and the scarce resources are distributed in a way that you often feel like there is only enough to scrape by, yet it never leaves you feeling under-prepared. Unfortunately, Sebastian's movement and animation often feel disconnected and some animations do seem clumsy in general, while some visual assets noticeably pop into view. Thankfully, these minor issues don't detract too much from the overall package and The Evil Within 2 delivers an interesting and memorable horror experience that is challenging yet fair.","The Evil Within 2 trumps its predecessor in every way, inevitably making this one of the best forms of survival horror in recent years. Dare I say? Evil Within 2 is Survival Horror, evolved.","The Evil Within 2 sports a less claustrophobic gameplay than its predecessor, but it still results in a thrilling experience with an intriguing story and noticeably improved graphics. Fans of the first game won't be disappointed by this sequel.","The Evil Within 2 is a terror title that offers many more possibilities than its predecessor. It's survival horror in its pure state, and it's very well-implemented.","The Evil Within 2 is a title that, despite the drawbacks, offers everything it promises: Terror, action and a good story. In conclusion, a Survival Horror worthy of a high budget production.","The Evil Within 2 is a frightening game, though perhaps not as pants-wettingly scary as the early portions of Resident Evil 7. The game itself is improved nicely over the original, with a great open-world structure and lots of interesting missions to take on. The actual story is extremely compelling as we follow Sebastian's journey towards redemption amid a world filled with both human and inhuman monsters. If you're looking for a lengthy and frightening adventure this Halloween season, look no farther than The Evil Within 2.","The tension and intensity can be felt throughout both the open-world sections, where you can choose where to go, as well as those where you’re simply walking down a hallway filled with framed pictures highlighting truly chilling acts of violence. It’s a thrill ride quite unlike any other, and as a survival horror release it will leave you shaking or at the very least on the verge of needing a nice long vacation.","The Evil Within 2 is highly recommended to anyone who loves a horror game, and you don’t have to play the first one to get an understanding of what is going on.",,,"The Evil Within 2 gives you more options to play your way in a much bigger survival-horror playground than the original. Although a disjointed plot and weak protagonist make it slow to get started, being pursued through an intriguingly bizarre world by plentiful and disturbing monsters kept my palms sweaty and my heart in my throat thanks to a strict adherence to the most important survival horror rule: you should always be on the back foot.","The Evil Within 2 is just like its predecessor: a mixed bag. While it had the potential to be something absolutely brilliant, Tango Gameworks has attempted to both cram too much in and offer too little at the same time.",,"The Evil Within 2 is good old-fashioned survival horror with a little bit of an open-world bent, and it works beautifully. It’s tense, it’s scary, it’s exciting, it’s absorbing – it’s everything I hoped it would be and more.","The Evil Within 2 is a huge step forward for the series that emphasizes exploration, stealth, and conserving resources for the more challenging encounters. Though the compelling plot is weighed down by poor writing and poorer voice performances, the game offers a great horror experience with a ton of content.","Evil Within 2 is how a sequel should be constructed. Everything about it feels like an improvement upon its predecessor. I had more fun digging into this 15-20 hour adventure, and would even consider replaying if not for so many other titles vying for my precious time. The genre is still poorly represented in the gaming community, so when a solid survival horror game emerges, it is best not to miss the opportunity to check it out.",,,"Although it tries a little too hard and fails to properly capture the best horror tropes, The Evil Within 2 is a great, imaginative game with enough tension that you probably won't mind the relative lack of horror.","The Evil Within 2 will certainly hold your attention during its 17 chapters, with flashes of brilliance sandwiched in among the game's various flaws and less memorable sequences. Ultimately, as a sequel, it doesn't quite deliver, but nonetheless, The Evil Within 2 is a survival horror that's just about worth persevering with.",,,"There's a clear respect for the horror genre in The Evil Within 2, with a number of references to classic films and games. The game channels that style and tone into combat that feels brutal and raw, stealth that has an air of suspense, and unsettling confrontations with dangerous, otherworldly creatures. The Evil Within 2 doubles down on the core of what makes survival horror games great: the focus on disempowerment and obstacles, and the ensuing satisfaction that comes with surviving a harrowing assault.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The themes of The Evil Within 2 are redemption and forgiveness, though there’s nothing this iteration of the franchise needed to do to redeem itself and certainly has nothing to be forgiven for. It’s a solid, emotional romp filled with challenge and scares alike. It’s certainly recommended.",,"The Evil Within 2 is every bit what a sequel should be - bigger, better and more pleasing than the original.",,,,,,,,,,"From one of the minds that brought us the Resident Evil series, The Evil Within 2 serves as a survival horror delight. It’s a jolting, excellent tale of horror and mystery with a strong story and a driving narrative, plus a multitude of side quests and sub-plots to keep even the most seasoned players engaged and thrilled. It is not a perfectly executed game by any means, but, like the original game, the flaws tend to get buried under the bloody heap of viscera and terror players will experience should they decide to pick up a copy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Enemy Within 2 oughtn’t to disappoint genre fans. It’s a challenge to survive, and there are some good moments of both physical and mental horror. I’m not sure Tango Gameworks’ largely backward-looking franchise will ever be a mainstream giant within its category, but sometimes the best horror experiences are those geared for a subset of fans – especially if you happen to be a member of said subset.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Technically speaking The Evil Within 2 is a lot better than its predecessor. The game is a lot more accessible for a greater audience, without forgetting about the die hard fans.",,,,,,,,,"Be prepared for some slightly clunky movement and somewhat repetitive walking simulator sections. Past that, it’s a wonderful sequel to a game that was originally sort of a miss, rather than a hit. You’ll become just as invested as Sebastian is when trying to find his daughter and walk away from the experience feeling like you got your money’s worth. The Evil Within 2 is well worth the purchase, but especially (for) those who enjoyed the first game and want something more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The fractured town of Union, which brings to mind the foggy setting of the original Silent Hill games, can be freely traversed.

assassins-creed-valhalla,,,,,,,,"If you’re in the mood for another open-world action game, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is a fine choice. It is a little too similar in aspects to the last two games, making this feel like the point where Ubisoft may want to consider re-evaluating the series once again, but the settings, characters, and overall world are enough to overlook most of the repetitiveness. So provided you don’t have open-world burnout from the other like-minded games that released this year, I think Valhalla is certainly worth checking out.","With Assassin's Creed Valhalla Ubisoft keeps on improving on the action-RPG formula, streamlining some gameplay mechanics and reviving some others from the series' distant past. The Viking plot feels accurate and fully convincing, with many interesting references to their myths and uses, while the modern-time storyline keeps on feeling too underdeveloped.",,,,,,,,,"Assassin's Creed: Valhalla takes all the previous systems introduced in Origins and Odyssey, and streamlines them into a more focused experience. The game may have some flaws, and it's a shame to see the combat remains mediocre after all these years, yet Valhalla is easily the best entry in the recent trilogy. Grab your axes and shields: it's time to go a-viking!",,,,,,,,,"If it sufficiently renews the experience of the saga thanks to a rich and functional overall design and an approach that should delight fans of the first hour, Assassin's Creed Valhalla also retains some stigmas of its predecessors that prevent it from aiming a little higher.",,,,,,,"Valhalla’s most intriguing story is one about faith, honor, and family, but it’s buried inside this massive, massive world stuffed with combat and side quests. That balance is not always ideal, but I’m glad, at least, that it forces me to spend more time seeking out interesting things in the game’s world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla blends old and new to create a unique experience and one of the best Assassin's Creed experiences yet. It combines series-best combat, a compelling story, and mesmerising locales to dually offer a definitive Viking and assassin experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It mimics the Odyssey formula but takes a step backward in almost every way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Where AC Origins introduced RPG mechanics and AC Odyssey took a leap of faith in pushing forward, Assassin's Creed Valhalla brings back the general feeling of being an Assassin from the core action-adventure titles. Indeed, by emphasizing the adventure and exploration components of the franchise, Assassin's Creed Valhalla may just be the most true-to-form release in many years.",,,,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla has compelling story and themes, an often brave exploration component and inspired characters, even though those are all flooded by fillers seeking to artificially raise the longevity value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Do yourself a favor and don't rush through Assassin's Creed Valhalla's storyline as quickly as possible. Just do as you please, expand your settlement, lose yourself in side-missions, go looting, spend hours doing enlongated stealth-mass-murders, if it was up to me, even go fishing like you're playing Zelda. Long story short: do yourself a favor and make use of all the elaborated variety this game has to offer. When you do, you'll focus less on those audio-handicaps and the somewhat slow paced gameplay which prevent Assassin's Creed Valhalla from scoring an eight or higher.","If you liked Origins and Odyssey, then you are rammed with Assassin's Creed Valhalla. Valhalla is cut from the same cloth, but knows how to balance main and side missions much better. The brutal combat system and a number of brand new side activities also give the game its own Viking aim. Unfortunately, Valhalla has some technical flaws, but that is (unfortunately) nothing new for seasoned Assassin’s Creed fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With a near-perfect blend of old and new, Valhalla is the best Assassin's Creed title in the past decade.",,,,,,,,,,Assassin’s Creed brings beautiful English countryside to the masses whilst fixing a lot of the series’ recent missteps. Some genuinely fun and surprising moments with some great writing make for a fun time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla isn't a light, fast and pragmatic Viking ship. It's a Titanic, magnificent, massive, and majestic, made to lead players through a 9th-century epic. With enough content to keep players busy for hours and hours, it's not threatened by any iceberg but rather by the weight of its own size. For the most dedicated, this can be a treat, but for many others, it could be a game they'll leave unfinished, living forever in the backlog.",,,,,,,"Even with its technical shortcomings on last-generation hardware, it is hard to not call Assassin’s Creed Valhalla an amazing open-world RPG. It’s obvious that Ubisoft did its homework and learned from Origins and Odyssey. Valhalla’s story is one of the best not only in the franchise but in the open-world RPG genre. The world is vast but not laden with empty, pointless space. Combat is addicting, character customization is the best the franchise has ever seen, and the welcome return of composer Jesper Kyd makes for one of last year’s most immersive and satisfying experiences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Assassin's Creed's third crack at the massive open world RPG formula is also its most confident, making for a streamlined yet sprawling adventure that ranks as one of the best the series has delivered since its inception over a decade ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, some choices (Cyberbots, Red Earth) can challenge and the Darkstalkers saga represents half of the titles available! A daring bet that will not please everyone, but we must recognize that the Street Fighter trilogy, with the anniversary edition, the Super Gem Fighter and the Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, is worth the detour. Depending on how attached you are to the ten games in this compilation, this one will have a more or less pronounced interest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Capcom Fighters Collection is yet another example of the utmost respect Capcom has for its back catalogue.

It was more than enough to bring me back (and keep me coming back during the season), but it wasn't enough to say that this is a whole new experience.

That’s certainly not a bad thing in my eyes. And to sweeten the deal even further, it’s free.

Unlike many other free-to-play games, Dauntless never makes you feel like you’re missing out if you don’t spend any money. Needless to say, if you’re after an action RPG along the lines of Monster Hunter to really sink your teeth into, you can’t go wrong with Dauntless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dauntless can be extremely addicting. Needing a part to upgrade or craft a weapon will make you want to “do one more hunt” before turning it off.

I’m excited to see what the future holds for such an amazing concept.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The variety of bosses is strong and the combat/reward loop is wonderfully addictive.

While I expected a game that was Monster Hunter-like, and it is, I actually prefer Dauntless’ progression path, as it’s not discouraging overall. Yes, there’s a big grind the higher tier you get, but the payoff for finally crafting that new armor or weapon is fantastic. If you’re paired with a poorly skilled team, you’ll most likely fail, but I love that it’s simply fighting the Behemoths without useless filler in between, so getting right back into the thick of things doesn’t take long with the cross play enabled. It’s free to play, so might as well check and see if it’s a hunt you’ll want to partake in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you’re a fan of the action RPG genre and love to dish out major pain to monsters that would otherwise eviscerate you, you’ve found the game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you are new to the franchise, on the other hand, this is a solid sports game.",,,,"For returning players, and those especially focused on Connected Franchise, there isn't enough here to welcome you back. Updated rosters and small on-field tweaks are the things we get every year but what really makes or breaks an installment of Madden are the big changes, which are up and down and ultimately make Madden 18 a solid starter but no Pro Bowler.",,"EA keeps improving an already excellent game, adding intriguing new modes and a new and very effective passing system.","Madden NFL 18 is the best football game ever, suitable for all the fans who spend a lot of hours playing, and also for the new players. The game includes a lot of player modes (online and offline) like Franchise, MUT or the new story mode, Longshot. Furthermore, Madden NFL 18 uses the Frostbite engine and looks incredible.","One more year of Madden NFL, with a lot of emphasis on its particular history mode, called Longshot and a intensification of the mechanics for the experts at the Madden Ultimate Team mode.",,,Madden 18 is a rewarding and highly enjoyable game that offers its players a chance of glory and a free reign over how they want to become a franchise legend.,,,"The shift to the Frostbite Engine definitely lets Madden NFL 18 look fantastic, and Longshot makes great use of that to tell a short but powerful against-all-odds story.","Madden NFL 18 marks a second consecutive year of Madden football in a holding pattern.

Longshot fell short for me, and I would really love to see a more defined Be A Player mode. Even with that said I will still sink another 60+ hours into this game because of my love of the sport. The refinements are enough to keep me interested, and the new engine makes the game look glorious. I really hope franchise sees a major overhaul next year, but for now I am happy to be plowing through defenses with Marshawn Lynch and dropping dimes with Derek Carr.",,,,,,,"Madden 18 marks an unusually large shakeup in a series that, due to its annualized releases, rarely features much more than small, iterative changes.",,,"It’s nice to see Madden NFL 18 taking risks and experimenting, with good results like the Longshot mode. Hopefully the franchise will continue to refine what works, and iron out some of the technical imperfections and lackluster game modes.",,,,,,,,,The focal points this year were the engine change from Ingnite to Frostbite as well as the Longshot story inclusion. Espacially the latter can make sure that this years’ football king is actually more than just a full-priced visual update.,,,,,Madden 18 can't easily be characterized by what's on the back of the box. Underneath what seems like a collection of thrown-together or even uninteresting features is a good game whose rewards are less readily apparent.,,"For me, Madden NFL 18 is the first misstep for the series of this generation.

The rest of Madden NFL 18 feels like very small steps forward for a franchise that could use some big leaps.",,,,,The best Madden videogame ever created.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Madden NFL 18 is a solid sports game. It's an immersive experience that all kind of fans can enjoy. But, being honest, it doesn't offers much novelties from previous entries. The story mode is interesting and with a good script, although we wish it lasted a little longer.",,,,,,,,"Although the new Longshot mode shines, Madden misses the mark with a few of its gameplay additions this year—so if you don’t immediately take a liking to them and choose to ignore them, the experience will feel a lot like last year’s. Meanwhile, the additions to MUT feel unnecessary, and like a desperate attempt to get more people playing—and potentially investing in microtransactions.",,,,,,,,"This is a really good football game that you will probably enjoy, but you will also likely still have some gripes. Madden 18 takes noticeable steps in gameplay and depth, but it's still teasing us with true greatness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Finally! A football game that literally anyone could play, but that does not mean everyone will enjoy it.","EA Sports rolled the dice by going all in with a new engine and single player story mode. For the most part, they pulled it off as it features interesting characters and a compelling story. While it is predictable, a little too short and contains some goofy quick time events, it's a hearty addition to the franchise.","In the end, football fans can’t go wrong with Madden NFL 18. Yes, there are a few hiccups, such as the lack of interactivity in Longshot and a steeper difficulty curve for newcomers, but none are related to the core gameplay mechanics which improve year over year. The visuals are stunning, the animations are more lifelike, and the level of control in the passing and running game is unparalleled.

There is a lot of content here for casuals and solo players, and the hardcore will love the under-the-hood changes. There is something for everyone, which most fighting games fail to capitalize on. If you have been out of the Tekken game for a while, it is finally time to return.",,,,"It's good to have Tekken back again. Tekken 7 successfully makes the jump from the arcades in Japan, with a cool customisation suite, a decent selection of modes and superb fight mechanics. You should probably go buy it now.",,,"Its diverse roster is packed with a wide range of personalities and fighting styles, bolstered by a raucous attitude that begs to be taken seriously while simultaneously mocking its more peculiar whims in the process. Tekken fans will find their next favorite game--one that's the product of decade's worth of refinement. And while some of this depth will be lost or out of reach for newcomers, there's enough fun to be had outside of hardcore competition to keep players from all walks of gaming thoroughly entertained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, Tekken 7 is a masterful conclusion to a two-decade story, an invigorating online experience and a content-filled package that’s absolutely worth its release price. Bandai Namco has knocked it out of the park with this game, and has set the bar high not only for other fighting game developers, but also for itself as creating a sequel that is better than this will surely be a challenge. Whether or not you’re a long-time fan or new to the series, you shouldn’t wait another minute to pick this game up.",,,"Modern game production being what it is, I’m sure some or all of this will be remedied in time, and whatever Game of the Year edition comes out in six to twelve months will feel like a more complete product. Right now, off the shelf, Tekken 7 is a 90%-ish game when you’re playing with friends or turning your favorite character into a bright orange devil clown, but everything else about this home release is weak to the point where it would have almost been better to not do it at all. Other franchises can almost get away with releases like this, but in Tekken, it’s a massive step backward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's a game that deserves a meatier and healthier package than the one Bandai Namco has given it, but even so, the online play will see Tekken 7 endure as one of the best fighting games this generation. [Issue#189, p.70]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I applaud the series for continuing an overall narrative, and the surprise characters and reveals were quite exciting for its story mode. Tekken 7 is not only a return for the series to the forefront, but a great addition to the genre as a whole. It tries new things and succeeds in almost every way, and even though I’m not the biggest fighting fan these days, as I’ve retired my fight sticks, I’m still quite enjoying my time with Tekken 7, in lengthy or short bursts. Even my 4 year old really enjoyed playing, being able to put together a few combos by button mashing, but more importantly, dressing up the characters quite silly to her liking. There’s lots to do for series veterans to learn but is also a great entry point for newcomers to the series. Tekken 7 is back and shouldn’t be missed, regardless of your skill level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tekken 7 does just enough right for it to be considered a success. However, hopefully the structure of the game won't be the basic formula going forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It may not have the depth of an official MLB game, or the out-of-nowhere shock that made the first game such a pleasant surprise, but it works, and it’s fun. Compared to its competition this year, that makes for a monumental achievement.","Super Mega Baseball 2 is a deep and fun simulation disguised as an arcade game, with good mechanics and a difficulty system capable of adapting to every kind of gamer.",,,"Aside from the disappointing sound design, Super Mega Baseball 2 is the baseball experience that Xbox sports fans have been waiting for. It's easily the best Xbox One baseball game available.",,"If you’re a baseball fan and not insistent on having official Major League Baseball players, teams, and stadiums, you will have a lot of fun with Super Mega Baseball 2. Despite the lack of stadiums and somewhat clumsy baserunning mechanics, Metalhead is hitting for power with their latest release.",,,"An accurate physics engine generates realistic hits, and it keeps stats and models fatigue and morale in interesting ways. This realism is betrayed by a few control issues that affect the timing when batting and an AI that doesn’t always behave as you’d expect. However, the unique Ego system allows you to tweak the difficulty of batting and fielding individually until you find the perfect challenge.",,,,"Super Mega Baseball 2 brings a great amount of arcade fun to this historical sport. With great mechanics and pick up and play gameplay, the game keeps you entertained and engaged. Since there it is not an MLB game you can’t use real players or teams, but that doesn't stop the game from holding up as a respectable title.",,,,"If you’re looking for fun arcade baseball action with a bombastic presentation, Super Mega Baseball 2 is a no-brainer.

While it won’t have any of the big names in baseball, you can still find a lot of fun in the deep customization and easy-to-pick-up controls.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Super Mega Baseball 2 delivers a rock-solid baseball experience that may come up light on modes, but homes in on the fun and skill of pitching and batting. I hope this becomes an annualized series, as Metalhead has a great foundation to build upon.",,"Although not everyone will love its visual style, players looking for a decent baseball experience -- especially on the Xbox One -- should definitely give Super Mega Baseball 2 a few innings.

world-of-final-fantasy-maxima,,,,,,"Maxima is an accessible, welcome spin-off from the main series. The story is finely paced, the combat system is engaging, and the dungeon diving remains diverse and fun, but it’s its compelling Pokémon-esque structure that truly maintains its allure. There’s a few issues with its writing, specifically with a character that you cant avoid throughout the entirety of play, but that alone isn’t nearly enough to hold the game back from greatness.","As a vessel to transport fans of the series back through its many stories, World of Final Fantasy Maxima is an unqualified success. The game is filled with old friends to meet and side content to play through with them, but it's also completely accessible as an entry point into the series for new players thanks to a forgiving combat system and a story with great humor and characters. The combat can be a bit easy, and there's not a ton of side content to keep you busy, but these drawbacks are far outweighed by the special experience of playing through the story and getting invested in the world. If you come into this with eyes wide open regarding the combat, there's plenty to find and enjoy in this world.",,,"World of Final Fantasy Maxima is an adorable spin-off with an interesting approach, a fun gameplay and an entertaining plot.

The graphics and genuinely laugh out loud moments will appeal to younger audiences, but older fans will also appreciate seeing deformed versions of classic Final Fantasy characters and monsters.",,,,,,,,"World of Final Fantasy is a nice change of pace for the series’ formula, but it relies too much on simplistic tactics to be a standout. I love the two main characters and the ideas behind the combat, but the dungeons feel padded out and the combat is just not that interesting.",,,,"A fun distraction from the mainline Final Fantasy games, this is a game you’re going to want to digest in small pieces. World of Final Fantasy Maxima is so sickeningly cute and twee that it sometimes comes off as unbearable (thanks to the main characters) but when you get past that, there is a compelling and intelligent battle system waiting for you. And obviously, the new Xbox One additions are welcome, even if they're not particularly huge. If you’re a die-hard Final Fantasy fan and can put the time into this game, you’re going to get a lot out of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Entertaining journey into the slightly “different” Final Fantasy world Gryimore, filled with Pokémon’esque creature collecting as well as challenging active time battle fights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The game is accessible for new fans, yet deep enough for those who've play many Final Fantasy games too.

This is the best Call of Duty in years; it looks better, it plays great, and sounds amazing, even when it remains the same experience we've learned to expect. The real question now is if Treyarch and Infinity Ward will be able to emulate the same passion and creativity of Sledgehammer.",,,,,"It’s nice to see the series turn itself around a bit after the lackluster release of Ghosts, and if we’re going to continue to see yearly releases for this series, then hopefully more will turn out to be as fun as Advanced Warfare.","Sledgehammer's debut with Call of Duty doesn't bring the revolution some hoped for, but introduces some welcome changes to the multiplayer experience making it very entertaining and compelling to play. The co-op mode is somewhat of a letdown if compared to the excellent Extinction mode from last year, while the single player campaign proved to be on par for the series even if we would have preferred more open missions and more freedom for the player. It won't disappoint any fan of the series, but it won't convert any of its detractors either.",,,,"It’s the best Call of Duty since Modern Warfare and may in fact be better, but saying that isn’t because it’s changed the series’ formula the way that game did, rather that it’s refined it.",,,"Multiplayer feels wonderfully fresh, thanks to the added agility of Exo Suit boosting.

The dramatic increase in speed makes it far more fun, and while I don’t think the parts gel as well as Titanfall, there is a lot more do to here. If nothing else, it’s worth a rental just to check out the campaign and see what multiplayer has to offer.",,,,"One excellent new addition is the option to test weapons in a firing range before games begin. Having gone into many a battle with the wrong gun in the past, this is definitely something we found useful.","If you've felt that Call of Duty has been getting more than a little tedious in recent years, as I certainly have, then Advanced Warfare might just convince that it's something worth taking notice of once again.",,,,,"Advanced Warfare's increased focus on player mobility makes a huge impact that freshens up the action and, in some ways, makes every other game in the franchise feel obsolete by comparison.",,"This was quite the surprise.

Infinity Ward is now the odd man out.","If Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare’s storytelling ambitions disappoint, the same can’t be said of the upgrades to gameplay.

Fans of action/adventure games will have a fantastic time. It is great to finally see Respawn branch out and get a chance to craft something they clearly have a passion for. This is not a game to be missed and gives me hope for the future of the series.",I don't think I'd be out of line by saying Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is the best Star Wars game since 2003's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and stands as one of the best Star Wars games ever made.,,,"While Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is strong with the Force, it's held back slightly by some irritating bugs. Fortunately, none of them can detract from the overall experience, its superlative combat and absorbing, enjoyable take on the Star Wars universe.","Technical, joyful and superb, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order takes a lot from Uncharted, God of War, and Tomb Raider, while bringing a solid Star Wars experience, balanced between action, puzzles, and platforming.","Fallen Order offers both an enthralling look at a shadowy time in the Star Wars continuum and a gameplay design that kept me hooked. From force pushing an astromech through the air and hearing it emit the exact panicked yowling sound it's supposed to make, to tracking down and defeating a giant albino spider that just killed me to restore my experience points (and dignity), it's been a long time since I've had this much fun in a galaxy far, far away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Respawn Entertainment's maiden voyage with Star Wars is largely a success, but it's a little rough around the edges.",,,,"The gripping single-player Star Wars game we have been waiting for all generation. Challenging combat is broken up by interesting platforming and exploration, and it’s all held together by a narrative I genuinely cared about.",,"I can see some gamers wanting a little more combat and a little less tomb-raiding, but the overall experience will be enjoyable for most as Fallen Order is the best single player Star Wars game we've seen in quite a while.",The new Star Wars game puts us in the shoes of a young Padawan who will have to survive after the execution of Order 66 in a mixture of various genres and mechanics that makes us like it more for its galactic ambiance than his own gameplay merits.,,,,"The bugs are ugly and the slides are a nightmare, but they don’t hold Fallen Order back as much they could have. Lightsaber combat is rarely as fun or interesting as it is in this game, and the plot hits some tragic notes that the bigger Star Wars stories tend to skip over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"On paper, these elements add up to one of the most elaborate and original Star Wars games in a very long time, but poor performance, a multitude of minor bugs, and a pervasive sense that swaths of the game are just lacking in refinement all undermine what would otherwise be an easy game to recommend.",,,,"Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a great single player adventure.

The combat is nice and the Star Wars force is strong, but technical flaws and a rippling story make Fallen Order just average.",,,,,,,,,"It’s almost comparable to the Star Wars: The Force Unleashed games, only with a new set of contemporary trends and a much larger budget. It’s janky, some of the set pieces are clumsy, and the storytelling is more of a miss than a hit. Still, the intergalactic exploration is seasoned with Metroidvania-lite gatekeeping and combat systems that successfully blend Star Wars flash with Soulslike danger and make the magic happen. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has the spunk of a PS2 game, the game design of a PS3 game, and the scale of a PS4 game. That’s a win in my book.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has some exciting combat and moments of genuinely interesting storytelling and acting, it just falls short of hitting the mark.

The stunning soundtrack compliments its brilliantly rendered levels, really giving off the vibe that you’re running through a big, scary world. A few more variations in its puzzle design would have elevated this higher, especially later in the game, but as it stands, any fan of puzzle-platformers should certainly experience this journey.",,"It’s a quick, fun experience that you can get through in just a few hours. If that’s not enough to make you grab a friend and enjoy, I don’t know what is.",,In Unravel Two we are faced with cooperative puzzles with a less deep and shorter story than the previous one. Fun and with a great level design.,Unravel Two improves on its predecessor in all things. Technically it is close to perfection and is emotional and sensitive on all levels. Cooperation brings dynamism to playability.,"While rough around the edges in some ways, Unravel Two is ultimately a fantastic game that puzzle or platformer gamers will enjoy without a doubt.","Unravel Two is a fun physics-based side-scrolling platformer. And the addition of the blue Yarny, as well as co-op through him, or her, is enjoyable, but the team barely capitalises on having to use both for pushing through the environment and when they do, it’s usually elementary. In fact, outside of the game’s Challenge puzzles, which I’ll get to in a minute, Unravel Two is a far less challenging experience overall, especially in comparison to the first game.","The story isn’t as moving or emotional this time around, but the invention and co-op addition is very clever and works extremely well. It is beautiful to look at and even more sumptuous to listen to, and I for one can’t wait for another sequel to come along soon.",,,"It still works as a solo adventure, but is far more enjoyable if played with a partner. And despite its oh-so-cute appearance, the generous helping of brilliant Challenge levels attest that Unravel Two has really been made by a talented group of Scandinavian sadists.",,,,"For a game where you play as an adorable yarn doll, it does an admirable job setting up a touching narrative intertwined with clever and unique puzzle platforming. And if you have a friend to play with, then Unravel Two is a treat in the visuals and the gameplay.","With beautiful graphics, a charming and emotive set of main characters, an amazing soundtrack, and wonderful gameplay Unravel Two is one of my favorite games to come out so far in 2018. I think the audience that can enjoy this is almost anyone because there is a fantastic main game for players but those who are not challenged as much as they want to be can find more difficult, optional puzzles. Yarny is still adorable too. This game just radiates joy, and in comparison to similar games like INSIDE, is just made for everyone.",,,,"Every bit the tactile, heart-rending experience that the first game was, but with added layers of complexity thanks to co-op - as well as enhanced replay value - Unravel Two is a fuzzy, warm hug of a sequel that'll make you smile.",Unravel Two offers some good new ideas and has the good taste to be equally playable alone or with a friend. But the magic can’t happen twice and Unravel Two sometimes feels repetitive and predictable.,,"With only six chapters that run roughly 30 minutes apiece, Unravel Two doesn't last long, but it's a game where the time you have is meaningful, memorable, and downright pleasant from beginning to end.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Routinely designed puzzle-platformer with freshly added co-op-capability. While it still is a lot of fun, it cannot recreate the emotional impact of its predecessor.",,,,,"With thoughtful gameplay, seamless co-op, a breezy campaign, and challenges geared towards gameplay masters, Unravel Two delivers a strong platforming experience for players of all skill levels. Whether you want a unique side-scroller to play alone or a teamwork-emphasizing experience to play with a friend, this is worth a look.",,,,,,"Unravel 2's gorgeous settings, clever puzzle design, and unique play mechanics make for an enjoyable game. In fact, I found that playing Unravel 2 is a great way to relax - it's the kind of game that's a good choice to play before turning in for the night. A dream-like game that makes for an easy transition to the land of dreams.",Unravel Two is still an experience worth playing. The introduction of cooperative does not hurt the solo experience and the challenge levels give an idea of how far the seemingly simple mechanics of the Yarnys can go.,,,,,"Unravel Two improves upon the original title by not only introducing co-op play, but by also refining the series' uncompromising mechanics. It's a shame that the perplexing story can't match the emotional beats of the last Yarny adventure, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Unravel 2 is amazing thanks to clever puzzles and fantastic coop. It's beautiful and has some great gameplay, but playing alone lessens the experience. The music is the unsung hero, because it's majestic throughout the entire playthrough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, Unravel Two is both decent and somewhat disappointing at the same time. There’s some magic missing, for sure, and a threadbare and confusing storyline doesn't help matters. Still, this is a game that is worth playing for anyone who enjoys the genre, especially those who have a friend who can play local co-op (since the game is strangely devoid of online co-op capabilities).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An adequate follow up to 2016’s indie darling. It hosts a plethora of new puzzles that force players to think, but without making them go mad. Too many checkpoints may turn off players looking for a genuine challenge, though.

Hell Is Empty doesn’t quite live up to the original series, but it still manages to deliver an emotional and meaningful experience. Learning more about Chloe and Rachel has been intriguing, insightful, and shocking.","Episode 3 - Hell Is Empty brings Life Is Strange: Before The Storm to its conclusion, resolving the story of not just Chloe and Rachel but also that of many other characters. Unfortunately some of the story points seem rushed to conclusion, likely a result of trying to tell a story in three episodes instead of five, and Chloe's backtalk mechanic is still criminally underused. On the other hand, there are improvements to the puzzles in this episode. Along the way, players will make many decisions, some far easier than others, all of which have some effect on the story to truly make it a tale of your own creation. Some players may well prefer Max and her powers to the more grounded story of Chloe, but the prequel is still a worthwhile journey through Arcadia Bay and an appropriate telling of the events before Max returned to the area.",,,Life is Strange: Before the Storm Episode 3 is a big disappointment. It feels like its plot was written in an evening. It’s the worse chapter in all Life is Strange saga and an undeserved ending for Chloe and Rachel story.,,"By improving upon the issues of the last two episodes while continuing their successes, the conclusive episode to Life is Strange: Before the Storm is a near-flawless end to the impactful, heartfelt prequel.",,"The design, some gameplay elements and the audio are excellent, and the ambition of telling a straight forward teenage love story with some family drama thrown into the mix should be applauded.",,,,,,"As a standalone episode, Hell is Empty doesn't quite hit the same spot that the previous two episodes reached — but that's not to say it's a let down. It just missed a certain emotional punch, and for me, I think that was a result of Chloe feeling less like the centre of attention.","With beautiful music and a heart-wrenching story, the final episode of Life is Strange: Before the Storm provides mostly interesting gameplay and big decisions to mull over in spite of over-dramatic themes and a lack of resolution for some plot lines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Even with some foibles, Hell is Empty does a fantastic job filling in the blanks of what happened before Chloe was reunited with Max. As a fan, its references to the original shed light on how many things came to be, such as Chloe's transformation. Yes, I knew the conclusion, but it still has enough interesting developments to keep me invested. Before the Storm accomplishes what so many prequels fail to do; it tells its own story that leaves you content, while also connecting to the original game in a meaningful way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Even though Hell is Empty stumbles at times, it's never enough to actually fall down. It'll intensify things in ridiculous ways because that's the stuff that makes for grand conclusions.

This action RPG set on a fun and strange spaghetti western stage provides an engaging story the brings all the chapters together nicely albeit through some repetitious gameplay loops to ultimately build a universe I hope we get to explore more of someday.,"With a fantastic roster of stories to play through and characters to interact with, Weird West is sure to please any fan of the Old West. Its mix of fantasy and spaghetti western tropes blends beautifully to create a memorable experience that twists and turns around the believable and magical.

The Weird West is beautiful, deadly, and free from constraining gameplay choices.",,,,"We are facing a title as rare as fun, which combines elements of multiple genres to create something new that won’t leave anyone indifferent. Expectations were high and it has far exceeded them.","Weird West's astounding world-building and intriguing singleplayer campaign are worth the cost of entry on their own, but the game's lackluster technical performance and polish are huge negatives that prevent it from achieving greatness.","There’s just so much to discover and learn for yourself. I didn't want to spoil the experience, because for me it was incredible. Gritty and majestic, all at once.","The work that has gone into the Weird West world and the characters that frequent it is impressive. Yes the grind is real, but it is a rewarding experience when it all comes together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Seductive atmosphere, impeccable immersion, neat narrative, the supercharged universe of Weird West is as vast as it is generous.

The Arkane DNA is evident here in the slick selection of powers and abilities, the choice-driven storylines and combat that gives you the tools to experiment, to toy with your enemies and approach problems from multiple angles. Side missions are delightfully well-written, there's a ton of dungeons, looting and crafting to dig into and, beyond a handful of buggy enemy encounters, the whole thing looks, sounds and plays like a dream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Weird West is smaller in comparison to Colantonio's previous games like Prey and Dishonored 2, but it's nonetheless ambitious and leaves a lot of choice in the hands of the player.

I will confess, I wasn’t a fan at the beginning, but now I’m deep in the midst of a second playthrough because I want more. That, to me, is what any game wants for its audience. Something that resonates with them, something they want to talk about and share. Weird West was never really weird enough in the supernatural sense, but compelling enough for me to get past the unremarkable loot and lackluster weapons, just to dive deeper into the stories of five unlikely heroes of their own wild west stories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Engaging combat is matched with stellar writing, great music, and most importantly it’s just damned fun.",,,"Succeeding on many levels, Weird West is a very good first game that bodes well for the next titles from the WolfEye studio. We clearly enjoyed the universe and the narration and the different ways of approaching the action phases are quite ingenious. Unfortunately, several small flaws darken the picture, starting with a controller gameplay that doesn’t really match the title’s ambitions. A lack of precision is quickly felt and makes certain actions, such as the infiltration phases, completely impossible. Nevertheless, this dive into the horrific desert remains convincing, and we particularly recommend it to fans of Arkane’s previous productions.","Weird West doesn’t quite gel on every level, but it still makes for a fascinating and deep action RPG sure to entertain fans of the late-90s CRPGs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"When everything works, Weird West feels great to play.

Don’t get me wrong, there is fun here, there’s multiplayer, hero powers and a decent list of songs, but the idea that these might eventually have you forking over more cash should make you trepidatious at least.",,,,"The new guitar makes a tangible improvement to how you experience each and every riff and lick, and GHTV provides an almost irresistible service for enjoying tracks you love while discovering new ones, with absolutely nothing hidden behind a paywall.",,,,"Guitar Hero Live gives us an offline first-person rock-and-roll fantasy, but it’s Guitar Hero TV that gives this series new life. The new guitar gives veterans new challenges while breaking down the barrier to entry for new players. While the on-disc tracks are, in my opinon, throwaway, Guitar Hero TV should keep players busy for a long time to come.","A lot of the issues with GHTV is that it is confusing to understand how it works within the game. Players are used to just buying songs a la carte. The new six button setup will also throw players for a loop. Again, I totally respect the new direction, but the familiar tones of its competitor really draw me to prefer that offering. Plus I can play what songs I want, when I want.","Overall, Guitar Hero Live is a huge jump forward for the music game genre while at the same time abandoning some of the things we loved about music games.

It’s two facets, Guitar Hero Live and Guitar Hero TV, are wonderfully crafted and superbly engaging, but the fun factor seems to have been zapped from it somewhat.

The mixture of skate action reminiscent of Jet Set Radio, the ludicrous weaponry Insomniac is known for and open world rail shooting delivers an arcade action overkill I haven’t seen in quite a while.","Despite these creative flourishes, Sunset Overdrive never quite surpasses the chaotic physics of Just Cause, the coherent style of Blood Dragon or the assured sense of place of GTAV – nor does it manage to draw its story and systems toward a coherent, impactful point. In the end its hero escapes the purgatory of a boring job and successfully wreaks revenge on the judgmental consumers he once served. But the game itself does little to undermine the increasingly over-familiar, open-world establishment, instead quietly celebrating the status quo.","Excellent fun, occasionally hilarious, very American and worth your time.","A breath of fresh air in a stagnant, overpopulated marketplace of gritty shooters.",,"Outside of the mission monotony, Sunset Overdrive is an immensely rewarding experience that has a look and style all its own and a great gameplay package to complement it.","Shallow, simplistic, and never quite as funny as it thinks it is, but there’s still more energy and imagination at work here than most other new next gen franchises.","Sunset Overdrive is the definition of the word “fun.” Insomniac has created something special here.

It is, however, an incredibly fun, visually beautiful open-world title that exhibits the best parts of what a sandbox game should be. Tight, stylish movement, engrossing combat and chaotic online fun makes Sunset Overdrive a no brainer for any Xbox One owner.","When the ""grind&gun"" works at its best, Sunset Overdrive is a joy to play, and the time needed to master the controls is well spent. On the other hand, the screenplay can't keep up the pace, offering boring characters and anticlimax, and the characters' growth in strength is slow and weak. Hundreds of collectibles and copycat secondary missions don't add much to the short main story mode: a true shame, since a more balanced offer in terms of gameplay and missions could have made a great exclusive out of Sunset Overdrive.","With its action spectacle, Insomniac’s new game is ridiculously entertaining. Sunset Overdrive is just plain amazing, and hopefully it gives rise to a new franchise.","Sunset Overdrive may have a few flaws inherent to many open-world games and lack an engaging narrative, but it's an incredibly fun, vibrant game that's a nice break from the overly gritty tone we see far too often in today's market. After Fuse, this is exactly what Insomniac Games needed.","I went into Sunset Overdrive thinking that it’d be a fun, interesting smaller adventure in between the big blockbuster releases; now, it’s probably the most enjoyable game I’ve played so far this generation.","An energetic and different shooter that can occasionally be too loud for its own good. [Christmas 2014, p.54]","The creative energy fueling Sunset Overdrive is an agent of change for a genre in creative decline. Its jubilant deluge of light and color, meaningful revisions to control and combat, and the sweeping diversity of skill-based missions push the open-world paradigm harder and faster than any of its peers.","For action fans, Sunset Overdrive is a must-have title.","Best approached as you would any caffeinated energy drink. In small gulps, it offers an exhilarating sugar rush, but too much will leave you with a headache. As such, it's best consumed in moderation. [Christmas 2014, p.104]","Sunset Overdrive is solid if underwhelming romp in parts which admirably sets out to poke fun at itself, along with the genre, and inject some joy into proceedings.","It seems like it was made for an audience of gamers over a decade ago, brimming with try-hard references and cringe-worthy jokes. Penetrate the skin, and you’ve got a serviceable game at the core. But a ten-hour journey to the centre of what makes Sunset Overdrive good feels more like a voyage to the centre of the earth.","Sunset Overdrive is creative and unique, especially in presentation and gameplay. It is too bad the mission structure is conventional, but we cannot be bothered as we have missed raging through a city Crackdown-style and Sunset Overdrive brings back that same grin on our faces.",,,,,"Sunset Overdrive is a very nervous game with colorful graphics, which offers a mix between Jet Set radio and Crackdown. In spite of very repetitive sequences, the length of the game makes it quite a good investment.",,,"Had Sunset Overdrive come out late August, there’s a good chance it would have gotten a lot more time to embed itself into people’s consciousnesses. Now, I hope that some of the interesting things the game does are enough to get it noticed in the deluge of big fall games.",,"Sunset Overdrive made us laugh and smile, revealing a unique value for Xbox One. The colorful world, many of the jokes and the original gameplay wowed us, accompanied by satisfactory graphics and lots of fun.",,"An awesome character and a big open world to play in, that's what you get in Sunset Overdrive. Lots of weapons, power-ups, mutants and a great way to travel, making it an unique experience for every player.","Sunset Overdrive doesn’t take itself seriously, making the action and character of the game stand-out about as much as its vibrant color scheme. Sequences that slightly alter gameplay or offer up a big boss manage to delight beyond most of what’s available on the latest consoles today.",What Sunset Overdrive was shooting for was punk. Where it landed was mallternative.,,,"Sunset Overdrive is a game that attacks so many senses, in a good way, that you may just find yourself not wanting to stop playing.","I can't blame anyone for being initially put off by the somewhat obnoxious sense of humor, but anyone passing on Sunset Overdrive will be missing one of the freshest and most exhilarating games the genre has seen in years.",Sunset Overdrive is a fun and well crafted free roaming. Insomniac played it a bit too safe and their game isn't able to deliver on all of its excellent promises.,,"It’s a real breath of fresh air to travel around an open world with such wild abandon, and the variety of enemies combines with the general movement to make fun the most important aspect of the whole package.","I don’t think I’ve had this much fun with any other game so far this year, it’s been a true highlight. I can’t wait to jump back in and replay my favourite sections, compete for higher scores and have some fun in the Chaos Squad mode.",,"Sunset Overdrive is the most fun I've had in a game so far this year. A brilliant combination of all the best parts of other open world games, complimented with really enjoyable traversal mechanics and a unique sense of style and humor.","Sunset Overdrive is fresh air through the open world genre. Skating, bouncing, wall-running; it does not just look awesome, it feels awesome. Most of the missions are a one-trick pony, but changing the guns you use makes that repetitiveness fade away.",,,,,"Fast, playful and colorful game that does have style and dynamic action, but also a pretty dull story that soon becomes boring. [Issue#248]",,,,"Sunset Overdrive is the freshest game of the year, and if you aren’t excited to play it then there will be tons of mundane repeaters coming out soon enough to keep you busy. For those of you looking for a little more than the norm, Sunset Overdrive is the game you’ve been waiting for.",,,,"The look, feel, and sound won me over. Forgiving the mission structure and forgetting the tower-defense junk, this is pretty much what I would expect from an action shooter for this console generation.",,,,"Mercilessly colorful futuristic city where virtually every element can be used for high-speed movement is likely to leave a newcomer more than a little confused. But once you become accustomed to it, mundane walking becomes almost physically painful: you’ll want to jump on the wires, bounce off the roof of some car, slide down the rails and never touch the sinful earth again. [Dec 2014, p.82]","This is the sort of game that people buy a new console for. It’s just that good. Sunset Overdrive celebrates the things that set us apart as gamers, and it draws strength from those differences. It never loses sight of the fact that fun trumps all in this sort of escapist fantasy.",,,,,"Fans will recognize its knack for inventive weaponry and nicely-designed traversal, but the two haven't been joined in this way before. Those elements make this rebellious teen something special that even its sometimes overwrought attitude can't dampen.",,,,,,,,,"Sunset Overdrive’s supercharged hyper parkour has a bit steep learning curve, but once you master it, this sandbox shooter shows its true colors. It's totally over the top, always on the move and absolutely hilarious. [Nov 2014]",,"Sunset Overdrive is just what the Xbox One needed - a distinctive exclusive to set the thing apart from the PlayStation 4. Titanfall was adequate and the Forza games are great for racing fans, but Sunset Overdrive is a glorious breath of fresh air.","Sunset Overdrive is a great game, and with unrivaled freedom of movement, extremely fun dialogue and chaotic combat, it’s never boring. It might, on the other hand, be a bit too crazy, and the mix of traversal and shooting never quite matches up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Beneath the glorious tech, and once the writing relaxes a little, Sunset Overdrive's wonderfully lurid and heartfelt - a bit like playing an old 4AD album sleeve. If you get that reference, you'll probably get this, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This is currently the best exclusive the Xbox One has to offer.,,"Probably the best next gen exclusive we've seen so far. It's not perfect but a great return to form for Insomniac. [Issue#257, p.56]",,"There’s a lot of greatness within Sunset Overdrive, but it’s obfuscated by a lack of difficulty and an aggravating tone. Ultimately, it’s worth dealing with the game’s worst moments to enjoy the many things it does get right. When you’re darting around the world like a ninja in a denim jacket, there’s nothing quite like it. If there is a next time for Sunset City, and hopefully there is, maybe things will come together more smoothly than they have here.","Sunset Overdrive is a colorful adventure that offers great and fun combat against a crazy amount of enemies. Unfortunately many of the missions feel like a chore, and both the city and especially the survivors are uninteresting. Despite the flaws Sunset Overdrive is still a good game that entertains while it lasts, but it isn’t a very memorable experience.","While its commitment to madness can be maddening itself, Sunset Overdrive is an energetic, fun-focused adventure. The jokes don't always hit home, but this is a game that loves being a game, and you can't hate that sort of honesty.",,"Annoyances aside, this is the game for anyone itching for something that not only refuses to be taken seriously, it embraces its ridiculosity with open arms.",,,,,,"The bottom line is that regardless of whether we're talking about character appearance, weapons, special abilities or buffs, Sunset Overdrive piles the number of options you can choose from sky-high. No matter who you choose to be, what weapons you equip, what playstyle you choose, or how you deck out your secondary abilities, everything feels valid and worthwhile.","It sometimes loses itself in its own parody, but Sunset Overdrive is one of the funniest games you can play right now on Xbox One.","Sunset Overdrive is a welcome response to the gritty, drab and deadly serious shooters that make up the majority of this genre. It sometimes tries way too hard to be funny, but more often than not it’s a riotous riff on things that gaming holds dear, and an intoxicating action saga in its own right. As long as you can survive the woozy cough syrup hangover the morning after.",,,,"Easygoing, addictive fun wrapped in beautiful graphics.",,"Sunset Overdrive is an easily recommendable game for anyone who has an Xbox One.

While the visuals are much improved over what they looked like as much as 10 years ago, they are definitely showing their age. But with so much story, so many great characters, so many beat-downs to deliver, this is a trio of games that gives you great value for the price (especially if you get it on Game Pass). For series old-timers or newcomers alike, the Yakuza Remastered Collection is a game every Xbox owner needs to check out.",,"Even if the third chapter didn't age well, The Yakuza Remastered Collection is still a great way to experience the Kazuma Kiryu saga after the prequel and the remakes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There's an absurd amount of content packed into the Yakuza Remastered Collection, and it's great to see fans new and old get to experience the entire series in one place, both on Xbox and PC now.

However, the updated graphical options and retouched translations make this the very best way to experience Yakuza 3, 4, and 5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While none of these games should be anyone's entry into the franchise, Yakuza 3, 4, and 5 Remastered are updated enough to not feel too out of place for those who are eager to see Kiryu Kazuma's story through to the end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game does a good job at letting you feel like you’ve made some really good tunes, even for the rhythmically challenged like myself. I only wish there were more songs to pick from without resulting to DLC but the offering available is certainly solid. All in all I’m glad a rhythm game without peripherals is here and I’m excited to see where Fuser goes.",,,"FUSER is a real virtual DJ experience, capable of giving us great freedom in creating our songs. It mainly shines in the modes where we aren't limited by specific demands like during the Campaign, but we would have liked more variety in the electro music selection, with genres like dubstep and hardstyle basically missing at launch.",,"Fuser the new game of Harmonix, is fun and challenging in equal parts. Something complex but a very successful experiment.",,,"If you have money to burn, are missing the party scene or just want to attempt to head off on a mixing career for nothing but personal entertainment, FUSER on Xbox One nails what is required. The control scheme has been well handled, the visuals are bright and colourful, and the plethora of tunes included will hit the spot for many. With a deep career being the highlight, and many other options available for those looking to go beyond that and into the online scene, Harmonix have hit the sweet spot with their latest music franchise.",,,,,,"If you’re a music lover, there’s a lot to love here. FUSER looks great, its track list has something for everyone, and its gameplay is a hell of a lot of fun. I guarantee you will not be able to keep your feet still as you drop your mixes together. Even if your crowd isn’t digging it, I guarantee that you will be.",,,,,,,Fuser makes you dizzy as the possibilities of musical creation are numerous.,,"Even people like me, who have long since given up the prospect of learning an instrument or making music as a creative pursuit, can rekindle a little bit of the creative spark they may have had once upon a time. The core mechanics of switching discs in and out, making new composite songs out of the pieces of others, is both compelling and exciting. Even if you play the campaign and find yourself unmotivated to make songs on your own without the score chase, the simple pleasure of having some songs you like come together into your own song is unique in games, and wholly enchanting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"By affording you such command of a terrific catalogue of diverse hits and certifiable classics, Fuser allows you to aptly fulfill the DJ fantasy better than ever before, without the need for clunky peripherals you’ll only use for one game. Though I poured hours into the experience, I still feel like I have so many corners and interactions to explore within the library of available tracks. Fuser transcends musical genres to deliver a magical and intuitive music creation toolset within the framework of a game.",,,,,,,"Fuser is a fun game in its campaign and festival mode, with a multitude of customization tools as a reward for our best sessions.

Fuser is a fantastic music creation tool that is a ton of fun to play. Online battle modes are fun, when you can find people to play with. Fuser is something I will be playing for quite some time, if only to try and get five stars for all the campaign missions.",,"After rocking the world with guitars and other assorted musical stylings, Fuser feels and sounds like the logical next step for Harmonix. It’s colourful, brimming with positive energy, and the musical mash-ups that you can potentially create aren’t just surprising, they deserve to be heard around the world. If a steady flow of DLC keeps Fuser alive, I’ll happily hop back into the DJ booth to create a few more surprise hits.",,Fuser is far more than a mere video game: is an awesome DJ experience with songs and genres of the last 50 years.

No matter what mix I was trying to attempt, my head was constantly bobbing and my foot was tapping along to the beat.

FUSER has recaptured that something special that Rock Band did years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fuser definitely has a few rough patches, like the Battles multiplayer and the slow rate of XP growth. Plus, let's face it, we can't all be as good as Marc Rebillet, so there are some features that players won't be able to take full advantage of without sounding ridiculous. But, for pure musical fun, there are few games in 2020 better than Fuser.",,,"Even as a toy to play around with hit songs, Fuser provides a good deal of fun, but the main issue is that none of these high points add up to much of an actual game at the end of the day.",,,"I can see myself spending a lot of time with FUSER, as I regale moments of my youth with various software that didn’t have any of the shine present here. A music game without custom peripherals is a breath of fresh air - both in reducing the cost and in showing that it’s about the creativity of mixing tracks, rather than just playing back some buttons in time with the screen.",,,,,,,,"An interesting game that makes mashing together different songs almost effortless, Fuser lacks a gameplay hook to keep you coming back.",,,,,,,,,,"It is entirely feasible to think you could craft a convincing set with this set of tools, and that’s the highest praise I can muster. There’s never been a better video game to move a crowd than Fuser.",,,,,,,,,,"Fuser is here to stay as a true DJ experience in the form of a fun videogame.

There's nothing special about this year's edition, and with all of the technical issues, it's a major bummer.","It all adds up to another edition of the best Madden yet, but that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Yearly sports video games have long had a challenge with their year-to-year progression, battling to find ways to make their games fresh. Madden seems to have cracked that code.","It assumes a lot of knowledge on the part of the player and a willingness to learn by trying its new systems.

Marcus Holloway is to Watch Dogs what Ezio Auditore was to Assassin’s Creed: the symbol of a new era, the mascot of a franchise that has proved it shouldn’t be judged on first impressions, that has proved it can move with the times.

It's got some rough edges, but if the devs will keep investing in it, this could become one of the most loved franchises around in the future.","Those who remember Spintires will want SnowRunner. With more ambition, physics-based driving returns. With a better approach to complete many missions and tasks in three natural environments. Good number of customizable vehicles, it is a constant challenge both when driving, and when considering the next step. Driving is not only speed and races. For these gamers, SnowRunner could be the best game for this moment.",This game has been very successful in bringing this job into the interactive scene.,SnowRunner is an incredibly challenging and rewarding trucking simulatior despite some minor flaws.,"Co-op bugs, weird camera angles, and sub-par engine sounds aside, I love this game. The huge variety of things to do with the 40-odd vehicles in the stunningly beautiful open world sandbox makes the game a joyful and (mostly) relaxing experience. And as the aural feedback is virtually non-existent anyway, lowering or even muting the volume entirely while loading up your favorite Spotify playlist is perhaps the best way to enjoy it. So sit back, crack a brewski, revel in the marvelous scenery, and haul a few loads. Just don't forget to pack your spare undies - you're gonna need 'em.","It’s a hugely immersive game that ticks a whole ton of boxes for those looking to gain new off-roading kicks, and the sheer amount of variety in terms of the vehicles, the trailers and the customisation and amendments that can be made to these is nothing short of stunning.

However, even when you’re struggling up an incline with a 20-tonne load, SnowRunner is a joy to play. Driving around, making deliveries at your own speed, is just as much fun as leaning into the gripping off-roading elements and, no matter what the game throws at you, you’ll always be throughly invested in your success. Truckin’ ain’t easy but if you jump into SnowRunner’s driver’s seat, you’re in for a great ride.","Basically, if Forza Horizon 4 and American Truck Simulator got drunk and hooked up one night then SnowRunner is what I imagine the result would be.

If that sounds up your street, then SnowRunner might be for you, but don't expect to get anything done fast.","The start of Snowrunner is demanding, and can put off the mere curious. However, for the more adventurous and regulars, this new installment of the Spintires series is a success.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"SnowRunner is a fantastic driving experience, although driving is just the result of a lot of time of planning the route, choosing and customizing the vehicle and exploring the map. It’s not very newcomer-friendly, but fans of the series will love the evolution, and if you’re new to it, with some patience, you’ll get into this engaging world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"SnowRunner brought out the kid in me when completing contracts. It reminded me of playing with Tonka trucks in the sandbox, but instead of sand, it’s snow and instead of Tonka, it’s real-world branded trucks and heavy machinery. While the realism kept me thinking like an adult, the mud running familiar to the series and newly introduced ice and snow mechanics make building bridges and fixing roads feel more interesting than other games. I enjoyed many aspects of SnowRunner and see the improvements that Saber Interactive has made with the new entry into the series. After tackling mud and snow, it’ll be interesting to see where the next title treads. It feels like they took a big step from MudRunner to SnowRunner and if the next step is just as big or bigger, it may be the perfect vehicular simulation game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"SnowRunner is a huge improvement over the game that preceded it. It is also a title that can be challenging but yet rewarding. The visuals are top notch, the audio brings the in-game world to life and the control and game camera are much more fine-tuned. Yes, there are a few hiccups now and then, but the positives far outweigh the negatives. If you are looking for an off-road simulation game that is not only different from the rest out there, but one that will give you a challenge and a lot of gameplay, then you can’t go wrong with SnowRunner, as there is no better game in the genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"SnowRunner will easily impress fans of the series, much like MudRunner did. And, most importantly, SnowRunner is one of the best simulators in years, and easily one of the best games to come out this year. It is a difficult, addictive and absolutely beautiful thrill ride that takes advantage of every single component, from vehicle customization to realistic terrain. Simply put, the level of detail involved is still a little hard to comprehend. This is the pinnacle of simulation games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
middle-earth-shadow-of-war,,,,,"Perhaps you might slap your forehead in dismay by the goofy plot or looseness to the source material but what's undeniable is, that Middle-earth: Shadow of War is a lot of fun.",,"Middle-earth: Shadow of War is the best Assassin's Creed-style game available. It's also a worthy successor to a game many called 2014's Game of the Year. The world is huge and full of tons of activities. The new fortress assault system creates awesome battles that feel truly epic. Then there's the return of the Nemesis system, which runs through every system the game has to offer. The system keeps combat fresh and it gives Shadow of War a much-needed splash of character and humor. Its faults are undoubtedly minor. One of the game's more prominent side activities, fight pits, are simply not very fun at all. Then there are the loot boxes, which aren't strictly necessary but will undoubtedly create a need to grind if you don't purchase them. Overall, Shadow of War is an excellent game that offers dozens of hours of enjoyable content. It's a game that's worthy of every minute you'll put into it.","Luckily for me, I didn’t go into Shadow of War wanting to re-live Lord of the Rings, I wanted to hunt some orcs. And this game delivers on that in more ways than I can possibly count — and it does so in a way that doesn’t require to spend one extra cent, near as I can tell.","Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor vastly improves on its predecessor thanks to a tens of hours-long epic story, great combat and a better and more dynamic Nemesis System. A must buy for any fantasy action lover.","Shadows of War is a sequel more than acceptable. It improves everything seen in the previous installment and gives us an interesting story based on the work of Tolkien, an immense world to conquer with our own army, hundreds of secondary missions and an agile and dynamic combat system. Pity for its policy of loot boxes, whose use begins to be worrisome in the industry, and some graphic details and AI that slightly tarnish the brightness of the game.","Middle Earth: Shadow of War offers us the same product as Shadows of Mordor, but better. A conservative game in the playable aspect that only has a few improvements, but enough to not think that we are looking at an expansion of the previous title. With entertaining and well-implemented ideas, an improved Nemesis system and a graphic section that without the best, at least it's not hampered by the Old Gen versions.","Shadow of War's combat is every bit as satisfying as the first, with tight, vicious swordplay, an extensive amount of moves to use and fun features, like beast riding and stealth. We've seen it all before in the first game, though. Despite having fun combat, some extra RPG mechanics, and an evolved Nemesis system which includes castle siege gameplay, Shadow of War gets repetitive fairly quickly.","There’s plenty here to love, but you will need patience and you will need resolve, because the orcs and their player-defined society is a thing of, as I said earlier, unnatural beauty, it’s just a shame the rest of the game suffers in their expanded development wake.","Monolith has something for everyone here, and just like Gollum with his ‘precious’, you’ll be hooked after a little taste of the power you can possess in Shadow of War.",,,"Similar to the way Batman: Arkham City built on the foundation of Arkham Asylum, Middle-earth: Shadow of War is bigger and more ambitious in scope than Shadow of Mordor, with great results. The way it expands the Nemesis system with far greater variety and fortress sieges makes even better use of the stand-out generated characters, and its battles with memorable uruk captains remain challenging all the way through the campaign and into the clever asynchronous multiplayer beyond.","Middle Earth: Shadow of War is bigger and better than its predecessor in almost every conceivable way. If you don't mind the repetition found in most open world games, there's a robust strategy layer here that combines with a great combat system to offer hours and hours of Orc slaying, army building fun.","Middle Earth Shadow of War is an impressive action game, with solid graphics and smooth gameplay. Nemesys System works very well, but it’s not capable randomizing the fortress and the world. Missions too are too similar, but Monolith has built a solid and fun experience.",,,"Shadow of War improves on almost every aspect of the original game. There is so much to do and the systems in place are truly special. The story missions fall flat and the loot boxes are kind of gross, but otherwise this is one spectacular game. Those that enjoyed the original will find even more to love here. I just feel like this game is marred by controversy and a poor release window.",,,,"A textbook example of how to make a great sequel, Middle-earth: Shadow of War takes the first game's template and expands upon it in a meaningful and interesting way. The result is a follow-up that's not only a lot bigger, but it's also a lot better. It talks the talk, and yes, it also Orcs the Orc.",,,"Things like the storefront and the menus and loot system don't make the game terrible, it just would've been better without them. It tries to be larger than its predecessor, there are more abilities, more weapons, more Orcs, yet it leaves you wanting less. But at its core, it's a fun experience with brilliant moments that provide fascinating insight into some of the untold stories of Middle-earth. I just wish it had known when to stop.","It's a shame the story is so strangely paced, but you hardly need it. Fortress Assaults are great set pieces, and there's a lot of fun to be had with the upgraded Nemesis System alone.",,,,,,,,,,,"In terms of content and mechanics this is better in almost every aspect than Shadow of Mordor, heavily relying on the vastly improved Nemesis system to carry the burden, while the story is decent enough to keep you motivated for most of the time. Unfortunately the fourth act falls short with its omission of story elements and the temptation of micro-transactions lurking - which, by the way, bothers me mostly because of the break in the immersion. Orks from loot chests? Really?",,,,,,"Although it would’ve seemed madness a decade or so ago the complaint that a video game is just too long, or overstuffed with features, is becoming increasingly common. Some developers just don’t seem to know when to say no, and Shadow Of War is a prime example of a game that would’ve been a lot more entertaining as a shorter, leaner experience. Less features, rather than more, would’ve been better, and we’re not just talking about the loot boxes.",,,"Shadow of War is Shadow of Mordor 2.0. If you liked the first, you’ll like the second – though hopefully you’ll be provided with a day one patch to smooth off rough edges. Though that’s highly unlikely.","Middle-earth: Shadow of War has high production values and is a fun open-world slashathon, but it's stretched thin. The storyline starts off promising, but all of the interesting characters get pushed aside to make room for nothing of consequence. Hours upon hours are lost to the abyss as players engage in a relentless cycle of gear upgrades and Orc recruits. Assaulting fortresses and conquering territory loses its appeal a bit too quickly. The game is pretty entertaining in short bursts, especially when Talion can make full use of his powerful abilities. Still, the lack of finesse when it comes to combat will make fighting feel a bit bothersome. The Ranger is at his best when he's eliminating the opposition with surgical precision, or making use of hazards in the environment. All in all, this title is worth a look; just don't expect to grow too attached to it.","A game with as much combat as Shadow of War runs the risk of becoming repetitive and boring, but Shadow of War never manages to devolve into an endless slog of orc fights. There are plenty of other activities and side quests available to provide a good degree of variety to the game, but the Nemesis system and the duels with orc captains really make the game feel more like a war than an endless battle. And even the battles themselves never grow boring - the quality of the game's combat system, the variety of powers available, and the feeling of near-invincibility you gain when surviving a battle against a dozen orc enemies make the game as interesting in its twentieth hour as it was in its first.","Improves everything that made Shadow of Mordor an excellent game but makes new mistakes with pacing and with its narrative. Again, an excellent (and deeper) game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This core action and the complex systems that underpin it are fun enough to play around with that it's a real shame that so many issues exist around the edges of this package, because those issues eventually started to diminish my enjoyment of the game's good parts.",Middle-earth: Shadow of War is a great sequel to one of the best videogames based on the Tolkien's Universe.,,,,,,,,"Shadow of War is stellar in the moments the player focuses on the game’s grander scope, but some of the mechanics that tie the rest together should have received a bit more attention. It may start off a bit slow, but the end payoff is more than worth it.",,Loot boxes and a sexy Shelob aside Shadow of War is an impressive game in a franchise that whilst takes liberties with lore of the land produces a fascinating world full of captivating experiences.,"If you can live with some bugs, Middle-Earth: Shadow of War is a solid follow-up to Shadow of Mordor. Everything that made the first game such a treat is still fully intact, and the addition of loot makes it even more difficult to decide whether to keep or kill orcs. The new fortress mechanic is very intriguing, especially when multiplayer is thrown into the mix, but it makes concessions so it doesn't heavily punish those who don't always maintain their bases. All of this is thrown together with a wide variety of activities and an overall journey that is rarely boring. Fans of grand adventures absolutely enjoy this title.",,,"While it's huge and complex in many of its systems, it still feels as if it is caught in 2014. [Issue#194, p.68]",,,,"Middle-earth Shadow of War consistently shocked and surprised me around every corner, with every Orc betrayal, every revelatory fortress takeover, and menacing look from the Bright Lord. It gripped me in ways I certainly didn’t expect having played the first game, and I’m already missing my trip through Mordor.",,,"Shadow of War offers dozens of hours of entertainment for gamers who enjoy action adventure titles with a strong splash of RPG elements. The moving parts may be a touch too complicated for the most casual gamers, but players who are patient enough to master all of the game’s systems will be rewarded with an exciting story, control of a powerful army, and an unstoppable protagonist.",,,,,,,,,,Middle-earth: Shadow of War is an improvement over its predecessor in every way imaginable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Its storylines run the gamut from deftly handled through to daft, and ludicrous liberties are taken with Tolkien’s characters and lore...All the same, none of this matters because Shadow of War doubles down on everything that was already brilliant in Shadow of Mordor for a good 30-40 hours of stupidly absorbing stealth, action and warfare.","Monolith Productions has an absolute sensational game in Middle-Earth: Shadow of War, and while there will be some detractors, the story, and game as a whole, is a masterpiece of craftsmanship that would make J.R.R. Tolkien proud. It has quality development that takes everything fans know and love from the first game, and improves and expands on it making Shadow of War a game that could easily hold contention for ""Game of the Year"". It is a must have purchase for anyone that enjoys quality gameplay mechanics, beautiful visuals, stellar sound, and a story that holds its own in a lore that is highly protected by its fans all across the globe. In the world of The Lord of the Rings, Monolith Productions has become the one developer to rule them all.","A definite improvement over Shadow of Mordor. People who played the first game and wanted to see serious growth will be pleased. There are times when it can feel a bit repetitive. I feel like I would have enjoyed it more if I could have spread the experience out over weeks, picking away at segments and really building up to those major sieges. But the Nemesis system does feel stronger this time around, with orcs that can be rather delightful as you continually fight them or prepare them to serve your own purposes in your army.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s a fantastic game with a near flawless execution.The journey is enjoyable and the characters you help and hinder throughout the game make it an memorable experience. If you’re looking for a high quality, AAA single-player game, look no further than Shadow of War.",,,,,,"Middle-earth Shadow of War adds a lot to the already great formula, with the addition of sieges and the great additions to the nemesis system this is a game of the year contender for sure.",,"Middle-earth: Shadow of War is a sequel perfect for the fans of the original game and fans of repetitive gameplay. They'll love this game but they won't be surprised at all. The combat system is really cool, the story is okay (albeit too long) but all in all Monolith took a step back as if afraid to do something new.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Middle-earth: Shadow of War resoundingly beats to the sound of its own war drum to result in an experience that is iterative rather than revolutionary. Bold and resolute, its strength in character stirs when leading the charge into battle to create sweepingly epic moments that thrill in their dark and violent chaos. It’s a promising return to Tolkien’s world, even if the journey isn’t without its meandering fumbles.",,,,,,,,
cyber-shadow,,,,,,,,"If you’re in the mood for some retro-infused 2D ninja action, Cyber Shadow is highly recommended. It’s a really enjoyable experience, with an absolutely fantastic soundtrack, and certainly worth checking out on any available platform.",,,,,,"Should you be in the market for a retro-styled ninja game, Cyber Shadow on Xbox is quite possibly the game for you. It plays well, it sounds good, and aside from an odd use of powers and damage from knockbacks, there’s not an awful lot missing - just be aware that your controller may come out the other side with more teeth marks in it than when you began.",,,"Cyber Shadow's excellent gameplay, level design, variety, and music make it a great modernization of the classic Ninja Gaiden formula.",,,,,,,,,,"Cyber Shadow keeps its promise without question. This tribute to Ninja Gaiden draws on period games to give us a fun and exhilarating platform / action game. Bosses all over the place, an agile hero and a pretty tough challenge, that's exactly what we hoped for. While it will surprise players less than a Shovel Knight or The Messenger, who went further in their ambitions, it remains a good experience for fans of the genre.",,"Cyber Shadow is a solid retro throwback with a few things that drag it down. The feeling of becoming more powerful and being able to take down huge enemy threats with your wits and skills is very rewarding, and the levels when you can use your abilities more freely to overcome challenges are quite fun. It's the trial-and-error areas littered with cheap deaths, demanding exact precision over long and frustrating stretches, that hamper the experience. Still, if you're looking for an old-school-styled ninja game that will test your skills (and sometimes your patience), Cyber Shadow is a worthy contender.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cyber Shadow is a good product overall, and a decent debut for Mechanical Head's young Finns; a two-dimensional action that pays dignified homage to a game formula capable of still carving out an important space in today's videogame panorama. Its distinctly hardcore nature and amarcord vein make it a title probably unappetizing to a majority audience, certainly pleasant for lovers of old action-platform arcade experiences on the edge of game over. Too bad for the absence of that ludo-stylistic flicker capable of making it emerge, as well as its questionable rush to a truly unnecessary excess.",,,,,"In sum, Cyber Shadow does a great job of doing what it set out to do. It’s a modern take on genre elders Ninja Gaiden and Shinobi, and it provides all the ninja lore, atmosphere, challenge, and aura that those games do. Furthermore, it gives players plenty of reason to keep playing thanks to evolving gameplay elements that keeps things fresh, interesting, and challenging. For anyone who enjoys the genre or ninja games in general, Cyber Shadow is a must-have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With perfect controls, epic boss fights and a banging soundtrack, Cyber Shadow is a superb action platformer that you don't want to miss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s absolutely nails to begin with, but stick with Cyber Shadow and it will be your new favourite platformer. There will be tantrums and swearwords, but when a game looks this cool you can’t stay mad at it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There is not a single original idea in Cyber Shadow, but it's a great game created with love for the classics like Ninja Gaiden.",,,,,,,,,"An 8-bit unforgettable experience that empowers the player more than several modern games, with a replayability value that is more emotional than mechanical.","Cyber Shadow probably won’t shine as much as Shovel Knight, lacking as it is of a little bit of genius and suffering from some control shortfalls, but it’s still an excellent retro platerformer that’ll teach you the pleasure of pain.",,,,,,
crysis-remastered-trilogy,,,,,,"If you’re a fan of the Crysis series, then Crysis Trilogy Remastered is definitely going to be a collection to experience once more. Whilst the initial representation may be too buggy at present, the true value of this franchise could really shine with the right patches and some additional polish. Those yet to experience this game shouldn’t be put off by the negatives in this review; sure, there is some illusion breaking bugs, and some irritation can be caused for anyone who knows the games from the originals, but in general, this trilogy still offers up the same fantastic sci-fi stories that they always have and if you’re an FPS fan who enjoys a good story, then you really shouldn’t pass this up, especially when all 3 games are available for the price of one typical release.",,,"Crysis Remastered Trilogy allows us to relive on our consoles the entire Crytek saga, which went down in history for several reasons, first and foremost the graphical fidelity one. The strongest title of the three is definitely the first one, while the second one remains the most disappointing of the group, but if you have never played these titles and love FPS games, they are worth picking up.","Crysis Trilogy Remastered is the perfect opportunity to go through these 3 Crytek iconic games that, thanks to a very well done work with the remasters, we can save Earth as Nomad and Prophet, controlling our own nanosuits, and fighting against an alien army.",Revive the Nanosuit trilogy with a new hardware is really satisfying. Last decade shooters still works perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,"At the end of the day, it’s really hard to talk about these games. I’ve reviewed two of them before and said what I needed to say there, and it still holds true to this day. Crysis 2 and 3 are great games that any FPS fan would enjoy. Crysis 1 shows its age here and there, but it’s not a rough game by any means and all three look really great in 4K. It’s a decent package for three fun FPS games with a lot going for them all for 50 bucks. If you’re into shooters and have never tried them before, or if you’re looking for a fun return to some great games, it’s hard to go wrong here.",,,,,"On PS5 and Xbox Series, the three games are very convincing: the real regret comes mainly from the fact that the trilogy is not offered, strictly speaking, on new generation machines, using only backward compatibility to boost its rendering. We must then draw a line on immediate loading, ray tracing or even support for DualSense features, despite a good rendering. As for the Crysis themselves, it is clear that a number of mechanisms are now aging: they remain good titles, but never speak of excellence ... It's up to you to see what you are looking for. [Tested on XSX]",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The first instalment was problematic, the trilogy as a whole is an entirely different proposition. This is a type of shooter game that simply doesn’t exist in today’s market and if you didn’t play it then, you should certainly play it now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A tidy and firm package of three of the most consistent and solid first person shooters in the history of gaming. The “Warhead” chapter is absent, but overall the creativity, the technical achievements and the vision behind the games is omnipresent and omnipotent.",,,,,"If you want to play three classic shooters, then this is a decent option. However, you should consider that Saber Interactive and Crytek could have done a better job.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Even without a multiplayer component here it’s hard to dismiss the value of the Crysis Remastered Trilogy. For those who have already played these games there’s nothing new and spectacular that’s going to blow your mind. But if you want to jump into it once again, this time with better and more refined graphics, you won’t regret it. It may not be as good as the new-age titles but it’s certainly no longer living in the past. Now for anyone who hasn’t played this franchise this really feels like a no-brainer. Scoop up the Crysis Remastered Trilogy for just $49.99 and you’re going to have a fantastic time!",,,,"Crysis Remastered Trilogy will give plenty of players a chance to revisit three classic games, with improved visuals all round.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I might be easily pleased these days, but I think Crysis Remastered Trilogy is an easy recommendation for anyone who loves a bit of first-person gunplay. All three campaigns are good to great, visually they look the part, and it can already be bought at a smashing price. Not the definitive package, at least on consoles, but it's very good all the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you're a console player and interested in some old-fashioned story-driven shooters, than Crysis Remastered Trilogy is probably well worth your attention.",,,,,,,,,,,"If you’re looking to experience shooter royalty for the first time, then Crysis Trilogy Remastered is the best place to start. While the series’ ever-encroaching linearity might make its first entry its most fondly remembered, tight controls and improved movement in the sequels make them well worth a playthrough, too.",,,,,

Awesomenauts Assemble! takes everything I love about action platformers and mashes it up almost perfectly with the MOBA genre.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A great competitive MOBA which will draw you in. It features great graphics and the upgrade systems are definitely unique and expansive. Unfortunately it feels like all the good content is hidden by a massive paywall and I wish Xbox One owners—who waited for this game for many months when it was out on other platforms—would at least get something for their troubles.,,"Even with the marginally sour taste left in my mouth after visiting the extensive marketplace, it’s still one of the best multiplayer games I’ve played on the Xbox.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A fantastic social game finds its way to Xbox One and a soothing 60 frames per second.,,,,,,,,,,,,,It provides countless hours of addictive experiences wrapped up in a massive never ending explosion of fun and enjoyment.

It all really depends on the player base and how many dedicated players it will bring.

genesis-noir,,,,,,"Even with these foibles, I still really dug the majority of Genesis Noir.

Just consider having a guide at hand, and perhaps something to keep you entertained in between projects.","Make no mistake: Cities: Skylines is still pretty fun. It's deep enough so that people who thrive on depth and complexity will find more than enough to sink their teeth into, while the more shallow among us (i.e. people like me) who just want to build huge megalopolises without putting too much though into it can do that too.","An awesome sim game, definitely the best one on consoles with great controls and gameplay depth.

Its combat has a ton of depth for those that dig deep enough and it's really quite fun. Its world design is excellent with secrets to discover everywhere and a clear path for those on a mission. This isn't the best JRPG you'll find on the market by any stretch, but it's certainly still good and those looking for a history lesson on how the genre used to be couldn't do better on Xbox One. Tales of Vesperia is a title fans will be happy to revisit.","The PS3 version of Vesperia that never made its way out of Japan has always been a long sticking point for fans, and with the release of the Definitive Edition, it’s a wrong that has finally been righted.","A bad remaster work with too few improvements over the last-gen original game, but a great JRPG nonetheless, with a compelling story and finally all the Japan-exclusive contents that western players couldn't see on Xbox 360.",,"We only realize that Tales of Vesperia is a decade old in very few moments, and you'll be surprised how well the game has aged.",,,"Tales of Vesperia: Definitive Edition does what a JRPG promises to do.

It may be pricey for a ‘Definitive Edition’, but the added content does boost its value to make it worth experiencing. If you want a great JRPG that you may have missed last generation, then Tales of Vesperia should be high on your list if you’re looking for a new game to dump 50+ hours into, as long as you can handle a dialogue and cutscene heavy experience.",,,,,,,,"Playing Tales of Vesperia: Definitive Edition will bring back memories of simpler JRPGs that offered fun characters, engaging stories, and colourful worlds.

Not only is this game fantastic, but it is also one of several hidden gems a lot of gamers may have missed its first time around.

Unfortunately some mechanical flaws remain untouched.,,,"Loaded with humor, skill-based action and interesting brainteasers, the original Darksiders is one of the best games to come out of the last generation. It takes numerous recipes from other games and creates an adventure that’s worth taking.","Darksiders: Warmastered Edition takes a great game and makes it… well, the same. I don't mean to belittle the work done on the remaster; the visual and performance upgrades are really good. It's a great re-release of a great game, but it's a game that still feels rather recent.

Furthermore, instead of simply giving us a barebones port or a half-assed upgrade, the publisher and its team of talented developers have done the biblical epic justice with a thorough and impressive remaster.","With the resolution bumped to 1080p with 60 frames per second, Darksiders has never looked better. The cutscenes look amazing and have tons of detail. Some gameplay mechanics do feel dated, like the fast travel system. It is cumbersome and could have been made easier to use. This was a big inconvenience because several areas in the beginning of the game were inaccessible due to missing the gear required to enter that part of the map.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Darksiders Warmastered is a more than capable upgrade for a game that is almost seven years old.

The game can perhaps offer some challenges as it progresses. For experienced detective style gamers, intellectuals and those who want fast paced action, this is not the game for you. With that being said, this game is very different to many games out there and that can be a very welcomed change indeed.","If you’ve never tried your hand at Phoenix Wright, the Ace Attorney trilogy is an absolute must. Everything from its memorable cast of characters and its wonderfully charismatic dialogue, right the way through to its vibrant presentation and its utterly stylish gameplay, is quite simply outstanding. Despite some moments within that are fairly linear by design alone, overlooking this compilation would be a sheer injustice.","We've known courtroom dramas are exciting and engaging for a long time. Who hasn't been swept up in an episode or two of Law & Order: SVU while flipping through channels? There's something thrilling about watching a case unfold before your eyes and to see justice ultimately brought to light. The Ace Attorney Trilogy nails that feeling perfectly. It'll take you through captivating mysteries that have plenty of twists while still leaving you satisfied that you solved the crime rather than being drug through to the end.

Most of all, it'll be an experience you won't find anywhere else.",,"Capcom finally brings to Xbox one of the best visual novels sagas of the past, with its brilliant dialogues and great characters.

The virtues of the three included games and the charisma of the characters are still intact to this day.,"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy isn't a serious experience, but it'll definitely get you thinking about the cases. It's a phenomenal puzzle game, and given the fact that the Xbox One port is this polished, I can't recommend it enough. You're getting hours and hours worth of content that will keep you coming back for more.",,"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy isn’t a collection that’ll entice people in who lack patience and don’t enjoy reading reams of text, that’s for sure. For those who love their storytelling though, I’d challenge anyone to point me in the direction of a game that hooks them in with such a thrilling selection of tales as this does; the cast of characters help ensure there’s plenty of intrigue.",,,"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy is a solid collection of courtroom dramedies, but far from essential for fans.",,,,"The transition from portable devices to consoles hasn’t hurt the quality of the Ace Attorney Trilogy, which remain some of my favorite games of all time.

Everything about it – from the brilliant use of physics, through the wonderfully crafted world to the constantly engaging gameplay – is a step above most other titles out there. Combat is about the only weak point I can think of, but even that manages to be fun, just not as much as the puzzling.

Some lackluster puzzle designs, technical issues, and a lack of difficulty stand in the way of it overtaking Trine 2 as the best of the series, but Trine 4 still remains a shining example of how cooperative gaming should be, and is one of the most gorgeous looking 2.5D games of 2019.",,,"If Trine 3 left you disappointed and you’re aching for yet another 2.5D Trine experience, you’ll undoubtedly love Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince. You won’t be surprised by it in any way, but you’ll lap it up from beginning to end. If you were hoping that there’d be something new introduced to the formula to shake things up a little and keep it interesting, however, you might be disappointed. Trine 4 returns to the safety of its roots, and feels unimaginative and unadventurous because of it.",,Trine 4 really brings the series back to its roots. It was great jumping back in feeling like I never missed a beat. I knew when to conjure boxes and the physics for the puzzle work just like you expect them to. It reminds me of a 2D Breath of the Wild even though Frozenbyte really paved the way for this type of game years before. It has just been a long time since we got a traditional Trine. I still want to forget the third game ever happened. Trine 4 is the proper sequel to the series and really reinvigorates my love for it. I still highly recommend playing with friends though as that is where it truly stands out.,,,,,"Despite some physics issues and dated animations, Trine 4 is a great experience with its magical atmosphere, which offers to the fans everything they could have asked for.",,,,,"Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince is a welcome return for the franchise. It’s arguably the best entry to date thanks to creative level design, gorgeous landscapes and excellent multiplayer.

Yes, you’re introduced to them gradually, but it’s a lot to take in and remember. I don’t think anyone would be saddened if the combat sections were cut, but I understand why narratively they’re included. While I may have missed the boat on the first few Trine games, I certainly won’t from this point forward; you have a new fan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince is a very fun game but the puzzles and combat can be very simple and straightforward.

It’s as simple as they come in terms of what you need to do, but actually doing it is an entirely other thing and you’ll find yourself wanting to wave your cleaver at your teammates in pure, ecstatic frustration, such is the sum of its basic ingredients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"A fun but frustrating cooking experience, Overcooked is a fantastic couch co-op party game that will put your friendships to the test. Expect to be shouting and swearing at one another a lot; it gets pretty damn hot in Overcooked's kitchen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The lack of online will clearly put off a few people; however, some odd design choices in scoring and the lack of any true single-player gameplay really stops Overcooked from being the game it could be.","Overcooked is a wonderful local co-op experience, and a party game that hits all of the right notes in turning friends against each other and making even the quietest people scream uncontrollably.",,,,,,,"If you have three friends near your couch, this game is a blast.

This can easily be one of the main multiplayer games any gamer will pull out when they have friends over, as it’s very simple to learn and will have everyone laughing when barking orders at one another.

If you don’t have anyone to play with though it’s going to be a frustrating and dull experience, but if you can get even a single person to play with you, Overcooked will have you coming back for one more order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unluckily, though, we couldn't fully appreciate the surreal and confusing story, even after a second playthrough.",,,"On one hand I loved Virginia — it was quirky and weird; and on the other, I just felt frustrated that I still didn't know what it was all about by the end of multiple plays. There isn't even much to say negatively about it -- it plays fine, if not the camera by default is a little over-sensitive, but this is easily remedied.",,,,,,,,"The story is human, relatable, enabling you to build an empathetic bond with Anne with ease. And even when events go all mind-bendingly crazy as you reach the final stretch, you still care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I’d question whether Virginia can be described as a game at all and for that reason it is unlikely to appeal to the majority of gamers. There’s not enough gameplay, even for a walking simulator, to be called a game and the whole thing might have functioned better as a two-hour animation, rather than trying to package in the limited player interactions which serve only to distract from the story’s immersion.","Virginia is a taut thriller that strikes a fine balance between storytelling and interactivity in a way that narrative-driven first-person adventure games have not accomplished since their inception, thanks to its blend of classic cinema and exploration. It should not be missed.",,"Throughout much of its length, Virginia manages to steer its story in surprising and unexpected detours, giving us moments and images that defy the intellect and yet still resonate deeply. While its abstracted art style and ambiguity might be a barrier to some, Virginia is suffused with humanity and a few memorable mysteries.",,,,,,,,,,,"Despite its short length and constrained gameplay, it tells an intriguing story with multiple layers and given its low price of admission, I heartily recommend it. My only complaint would be that I wish the game allowed you to interact with your environment more and explore it to a greater degree. While there are secrets which need to be discovered through multiple playthroughs, that sense of being caged never goes away. However, that doesn’t detract from the gameplay and Virginia is unlike anything else you’ve ever played before.",,,,,,,,,,"Virginia trades that sort of clarity for another: that of the subjective, ever-precarious moment...And what gorgeous, reverberant moments there are in this game, empowered by its absent words and explanations. As David Lynch put it, answering a question about Lost Highway, “There’s things that have to happen, information that has to be given, for the thing to go. To say with words any more, would not be good.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An interactive experience unlike any other.

There’s a nice community of players still going strong online and this game could be a great controller passing time for local play. Sure, the tutorial is a bit rough, but just playing and experimenting with the game allowed me to get better and have a fun time with it. Anyone who is into arcadey sports titles and to a lesser extent, fighting games should give this one a try.",,,,"A cracking sequel to a cult arcade classic, Windjammers 2 ups the ante with sharp hand-drawn visuals and more than a modicum of pure arcade panache. The idea of Pong (with frisbees, mind you) turned up to 11 has never been so appealing.","Windjammers 2 is the logical continuation of the episode released in 1994: new characters, new mechanics and online ranked games, it comes out with all the advantages expected of such a title in 2022. in easy hand does not close the door to neophytes while the added moves constitute an additional strategic layer for amateurs of high level game.

The game's formula is still fun and addictive, but someone could need something new.",,,,,,,"As relentlessly bastard-hard as ever, Trials Fusion coaxes you in with its easy and medium events, before kicking you square in the balls with its later hard and extreme tracks.

Best Master System game ever, indeed.","Since the Sega Master System didn’t enjoy quite the same level of success as the Nintendo Entertainment System, Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap will be new territory for a large number of gamers. Even if you have played it previously, this is a trip that you should take again, just to take in the wonderful cast of characters. It’s not flawless, but there’s nothing here that should prevent platformer fans from helping Wonder Boy return to his normal self.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap is a fantastic game which may feel slightly dated due to its archaic combat mechanics. However, the mind-blowing visuals and ability to instantly switch to the original graphics make up for any shortcomings. Not only is the game challenging, but it’s a step above the majority of modern platformers due to its interconnected worlds. In many ways, Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap will make you realize how action platformers have regressed over the years. If you’re going to buy just one platformer on Xbox One, then this game should be your purchase. It’s that much of a revelation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wonder Boy The Dragon's Trap is a gorgeous platformer and a decent return of a long forgotten SEGA game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"All things considered, Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap is a beautiful enhancement to what was obviously a hidden gem back in the 8-bit era of gaming, which unfortunately I missed. Despite the brutal difficulty and the somewhat short gameplay, playing it years late is enjoyable and highly recommended, especially for those gamers who are looking for bit of nostalgia or a modern looking side scrolling platformer to play through to get away from the glut of FPS, driving or sports games out there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Dragon’s Trap: Wonder Boy is an excellent remake of a beloved classic. The enhanced visuals and superb audio really bring the game into the modern age complementing the excellent design of the original. Unfortunately, inherited design flaws such as some obscure puzzles, imprecise hit detection, and the lack of a hints system do hold the game back. However, these issues do not detract too much from the overall experience. This modern version of a classic game will appeal to a new generation of gamers and also remind longtime fans why they fell in love with the original.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
foregone,,,,,,"All in all Forgone has been super fun for me. Sure, I could nit-pick at some very minor changes but what Big Blue Bubble has made is something awesome and that all platforming fans should give it a look. I think it provides the right amount of challenge for all gamers approaching it.",,,,,Foregone is a metroidvania with all the necessary ingredients that will take you to live a thrilling adventure from start to finish with amazing pixel art and a story that will surprise you.,,,"Foregone on Xbox One will make you feel like you’re God’s gift to gaming - a cartwheel of bullets and blades. By the time you reach the end, you might even have earned it. Don’t give in to the easy comparisons with Dead Cells - this is a sumptuous, furious and rock-hard romp that’s better seen as a partner to that brilliant game.",,,,,,,,"Foregone is a wonderful surprise in a crowded genre of gaming. There are a ton of other titles exactly like it, but this one just stands head and shoulders above the rest. I cannot recommend this game enough. It might tick all the usual boxes, but it ticks them extremely well. I haven’t had this much reverence for a game of this type in a long time. Do not sleep on Foregone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s clear that Foregone struggles to define itself within the genre on a surface level. In practice, however, the complementary elements and design choices mesh in a way that makes it feel quite unique. It is unlikely to evoke passion from those who already dislike the genre, but there is enough value to justify giving it a shot simply for the fluidity of its gameplay.",,,,,,,Foregone is a good metroidvania we can recommend to those fans who have already played all the great games in the genre and are still looking for more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Foregone is a solid entry in the metroidvania genre, and the limited options in combat are slick enough. It does what it needs to do — the problem is that there are many better examples of this structure that would have to be recommended first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Foregone is certainly a solid 2D action game with some nifty RPG elements that'll keep you striving to be the best warrior you can be.,,,,,,,,,"An open platformer heavy on combat, upgrading, and exploration, Foregone is an involving and entertaining adventure well worth downloading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pumpkin-jack,,,,,,"Overall, if you’re after a classic platformer that harkens back to the good old days of platforming past, then Pumpkin Jack is certain to bring you some joy. The story may not be one I, or anyone else, will be telling their children about (as I did with Crash Bandicoot as if it were a true story) but it’s not a totally inept offering either, and if you simply want something that can return that nostalgic charm, and some Halloween festivities, then there are many worse options you could choose than a shot with Pumpkin Jack.",,"Pumpkin Jack is an excellent 3D platformer that’s well worth your time, whether you’re playing it at Halloween or any other time of the year.",,,A complete 3D platform that will surprise you if you give it a chance.,,,"Pumpkin Jack is both timely and welcome on Xbox One. As a Halloween-themed action platformer, it fills a niche and void nicely and delivers a brilliant adventure in its own right. From its great pacing, solid gameplay, and consistently engaging design with only a few minor annoyances, this is one spooky adventure that can potentially achieve cult status.",,,,,"Pumpkin Jack is a practically homemade game, with a lot of heart: it aims to celebrate iconic games such as Medievil and Jak and Daxter, without inventing anything new from a purely playful point of view, but offering several hours of genuine entertainment thanks to simple and well positioned ideas, accompanied by an extremely cunning story.",,,"Pumpkin Jack is a great looking game, a great playing game, and a well written game. It should not be skipped in the slightest. The Halloween aesthetic may seem out of season now, but don’t let it fool you, this game is enjoyable at any time; the minions of hell rising up to destroy humanity truly is a timeless tale. The end credits show the development and love Nicolas poured into this game, and all of that can be found in the final product. I really hope this isn’t the last we see of Jack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"When you go trick-or-treating, you don't come back 100 percent with candy you love. There's some bleh stuff mixed in, stuff that you put up with to get to the candy you can't wait to eat. That's a perfect analog for Pumpkin Jack. You'll push past parts of it because this mascot platformer has some really great qualities. And, when viewed as a whole, a bucket full of candy ain't so bad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pumpkin Jack makes for one heck of a Halloween treat with its tight and challenging gameplay that's set in a fun spooktacular world.,,,,,,,,,"Pumpkin Jack is both a love letter to years of 3D platformers and one of the most timely releases of 2020, delivering a great family-friendly adventure just in time for Halloween.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
darkwood,,,,,,"Constantly tense and surprisingly varied, Darkwood offers a new take on the tired genre, one that never relies on needless scares and cheap tactics to set its captivating, grim atmosphere. Here, you’re simply thrown to the unknown and left to fend for yourselves by any means necessary, with no hand-holding whatsoever, and no easy way out. Despite a few issues, Darkwood offers everything a great survival horror should, and more besides.",,,"Darkwood offers a scary and thrilling experience, mainly thanks to a very good sound design and an oppressive top-down world. Where if fails, though, is in a slow and intricate gameplay, making part of the experience not so satisfying. It's, however, still an advised buy for lovers of horror survival experiences.","Darkwood feels like an old school game. Its proposal is ruthless to the player and transports him to a cruel world, but its defiant proposal is gratifying. The pretext of the game is already original, an originality that adds some ingredients of terror and survival that amount to a demanding and unique experience for the player.","Darkwood is a huge work to be the first of the studio, it is one of the best horror games of the generation. A masterpiece bizarre and magnetic in narrative, with an infinite personality.","Darkwood is a tense and challenging horror and survival game with superb atmosphere, great visual presentation, and a strong gameplay core, but it's marred by clunky movement and unintuitive combat mechanics.",,"Darkwood is a rare kind of game – an experience that is so cohesive and masterful in almost every way. Every time I played, it felt as though I was stepping through the screen to another world, one that is as twisted and dark as the wilderness that surrounds it. Honestly, the less you know the better, so just go play it and experience its brilliance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The character that you play is dull, so if he died no tears were shed. While some games get you hooked with “just completing one more quest” since you have none, there was no desire to continue. I know many people will disagree but I’m just being straightforward. It was hard for me to find anything within Darkwood that I truly admired besides the theme. Just because it’s not for everyone doesn’t mean it’s a bad game. Lots of people will love it. I just think that the majority won’t.",,,,,"Darkwood is a very unique experience that relies on darkness and silence frequently, causing your own imagination to run wild and fill in the horrific gaps. There’s a bit of a learning curve to get comfortable with how the in-game world operates, but once things click, you’ll be enamoured. Survival horror fans definitely need to give this one a go.",,"Darkwood truly puts the ""survival"" in survival horror and is a game that all survival horror fans should check out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Darkwood is a purposefully deliberate survival game that forces you to explore, but at the same time punishes you for spending too much time and effort searching one area. You don’t want to spend too many resources building up your camps, but you need to gather enough to be able to survive your stay there. It’s a delicate balance that is really well executed but not overly explained. The survival mechanics can be learned very quickly, and once you are two or three game days in you will start to find a groove. Just remember to turn the generator off in the morning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you haven't played the original game, you should consider its purchase even on its technical side there isn't a great graphical upgrade.","As a remaster is no big deal but Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen brings us back a classic-style game, which focuses on the classics of the RPG group of adventurers. Monster hunts and dungeons, in a great adventure where the main story, although of quality, is only a pretext.","Dragon's Dogma is a role-playing game that deserves to be appreciated. With so much content and depth, Dark Arisen is just as impressive as ever in the gameplay department. Few would've expected a Japanese developer like Capcom to release a ""Western-style"" action-RPG that could hold its own against the Elder Scrolls and Witcher series, but that's exactly what happened.",,"For those who have been curious about Dark Arisen and love old fashioned RPG’s, then this is a must buy. Yes, the quests can get boring and there is a big whiff of old generation about the experience, but there are tons of content for your money.",,,,,,"Even for those who’ve dug into the Bitterblack Sanctum and defeated the Daimon, other secrets seem to always be lurking somewhere else.

the-turing-test,"One of the better sci-fi puzzlers not starring GLaDOS, with plenty to keep grey matter happy. [Nov 2016, p.86]",,,,,,The Turing Test delivers not just a worthwhile game but an amazing story that will sit with you long after the credits.,,"A very good first person puzzle game, with solid - even if not too original - puzzle design and a surprising story. Definitely advised to lovers of Portal-like games.",,,"A tough as nails puzzler that in some ways blows Portal out of the airlock for its brain-bending antics. Those familiar with Pneuma: Breath of Life will find The Turing Test very much in the same vein. You'll explore and you'll work out puzzles in order to progress, all with some kind of social or humanistic undertone such as the meaning of life — or whether AIs will one day overthrow humankind and we will all be fleshy meat-slaves to our new robotic overlords.",,,,,,,,The puzzles in The Turing Test are all impressive and smartly designed. Some offer relatively simple solutions while others truly test your mental mettle.,,,,,,"The Turing Test is delivered well, resplendent in Unreal 4, and carries a few genuinely interesting moments that make some of the more languid ’downtime’ easier to swallow. We've had moments on our commute just mulling over some of the (ridiculously!) dry jokes in the game, but we love that - they feel like the bytes of humour you’d hear a museum curator crack as they show you their favourite exhibit. A puzzler for anyone who wants an aperitif after The Witness and The Talos Principle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The challenge level of the puzzles is quite low at times. But the design as well as the atmosphere and especially the dialogue between Ava and the AI will keep you going. If you think Portal is too difficult for you, give this one a chance.",,,,,"The Turing Test joins Portal as another great puzzle game featuring an ominous A.I. entity. The puzzles will make you think, but not as much as the story’s wonderful exploration of life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Turing Test is a fantastic albeit short puzzle game which features gorgeous graphics and clever problems. You’ll not only remember the gameplay, but you’ll also remember the ending and will be talking about how shocking it was for weeks to come.",,"From the puzzles reflecting ideas, concepts, and even past conversations to the optional rooms requiring lateral thinking that is brought up several sectors after the room that needs it, The Turing Test truly will test you.",,,"It is heavily derivative, but The Turing Test is a worthy imitation of the 'Portal' and its ilk. It has fun, quick puzzles and a disquieting, thought-provoking dialogue between two minds whose true nature is unclear. It is a pleasant way to spend a few hours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Building on what it achieved with Pneuma: Breath Of Life, The Turing Test is a far more robust, captivating and fulfilling experience. It’s not breaking ground, but it explores some fun ideas and challenges you to follow them. As a sign of Bulkhead’s growing confidence and ambition, it’s a fantastic step.",,,"It’s easy to say that The Turing Test gets a passing grade. Lots of thought has clearly gone into how the story plays out, while the puzzles are designed to teach the player without overtly telling you how a new gameplay mechanic works. Little details at the end of each zone and side puzzle flesh out just what’s going on, while the puzzles will test your logical thinking. It’s not without its flaws, but it’s certainly worth a look at for those wanting to scratch that First Person Puzzle itch.","The Turing Test is an absolute marvel of intelligent puzzle design that makes you feel amazing for conquering it. You can feel an intense love for the specific brand of room-by-room puzzling at every corner here...And with a fascinating narrative that explores themes few games have ever touched, you’ll be constantly enthralled by the philosophical debates between a human and an AI just as often as you’ll be frustrated by a puzzle for designing around the simple solution you had in your head.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A steady puzzle game elevated by its story and mystery that's never quite original enough to stand out.,,,,,,,,,,,,"This game is worth every penny, even with a few bumps in the road.

kingdom-hearts-iii,"Inconsistent but entertaining, packed with likeable, iconic characters. [Issue#225, p.72]",,,,,"The combat and traversal in Kingdom Hearts III is simply outstanding, with each massively in-depth system intertwining perfectly to produce a widely compelling basis that constantly excites. There’s a fantastic amount of variation as far as the game’s worlds, its enemies, and its activities are concerned, bolstering its already impressive value. Unfortunately, some sloppy development choices and a convoluted plot hold it back from greatness.","Fans of the series have been waiting for this game for a long time, and Kingdom Hearts III will not disappoint them. Both the new and old worlds are a joy to play through, and you are given the freedom to explore them as and when you want. The story is complicated, there's no denying it, and this is not an easy jumping on point for people new to the series. If you put your time into this game there's an abundance of rewards to get out of it, only tarnished by some minor gameplay issues. Sora's latest adventure is magical.",,"Kingdom Hearts III manages to answer many of the series pending questions, entertaining us with an immediate and maybe a bit too easy but very funny gameplay and wowing us with awesome graphics. Story and gameplay might have been better paced and we feel something more could have been made on the many series' pending plots, but this definitely is a game every lover of the series needs to play.","Kingdom Hearts III is the game fans were waiting for. Thanks to its addictive gameplay, a beautiful graphic design and a spectacular soundtrack, the game puts a finishing touch to the Xehanort saga with a plot not suitable for beginners.",Kingdom Hearts III is the reunion with our heroes. It is the end of the road. It is the return of magic.,,,"Kingdom Hearts III is a fitting conclusion to this Dark Seeker saga; and by fitting, I mean a hodge-podge of ideas and sub-plots that don’t always seem to work but still manage to muster something pretty decent.",,,"I thoroughly enjoyed Square Enix’s evolution of Kingdom Hearts’ gameplay and fidelity to Disney’s beloved animated movies. While the storytelling could use some punching up, Square has done a fantastic job of capturing the spirit of these worlds while giving us a massive toolbox for battles and exploration. Even as I watched the dust settle on the story I wanted to jump right back in to collect everything. But to see all of the events of the Kingdom Hearts games so far culminate is, frankly, weird. Having been given so much time to ruminate, its specific resolutions aren’t all that surprising, but only a marginal impact is lost as a result. I still loved seeing so many characters from throughout this series interact in new ways and rekindle old bonds. It’s nice to see that, even so long after the very first game, Kingdom Hearts 3 is so full of heart.","Kingdom Hearts 3 has been a long time coming, leading some fans to wonder if it would ever finally get there. The long wait proved to be well worth it though, with a satisfying ending they’ve been wanting for years, while also managing to setup the future of the franchise as well.",,"Even despite its downfalls – its repetitive gameplay loop, its dense narrative and its lack of worthwhile adventuring – there’s something that makes Kingdom Hearts 3 difficult to resist.",,"Kingdom Hearts III is a great game. Sure I had my issues with it, but the overall package is jam packed with things to do, a fun story, and a flashy and deep combat system all wrapped around a fun RPG. Fans of the series have nothing to fear here, and even newcomers can jump in and enjoy their time with it without having too much of a problem following the story, and even if the story is not your thing, the combat will keep action fans and RPG players entertained throughout. This is the best Kingdom Hearts game to date.",,,,"The final chapter of Sora’s story is full of surprises, but it absolutely delivers something that fans have been waiting years for and Square Enix certainly know how to bring a person to tears in a very beautiful way. But the studio has gone above and beyond by giving players so much more to do then just the core story, with a variety of extras to jump back in to. Kingdom Hearts 3 is a thoroughly enjoyable experience that you’ll find yourself wanting to come back to for more.","As a pretext for a trip to the worlds of Disney, it is mesmerizing from start to finish, thanks to an exemplary artistic direction that adapts constantly to the subject. It offers a surprising variety of gameplay and constantly draws the eye, thanks to its dynamic fights. However, the redundancy of the confrontations and its ultra condensed scenario which is lost in uninvited dialogues will sometimes tend to annoy or tire.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A confused and confusing mess of terrible storytelling, simple action, and endless fan service that will delight existing players but baffle new ones.",,,,,,,,,"However eye-glazing Kingdom Hearts 3’s overarching narrative may be, it’s worth stressing how easy it is to get swept up in the broad strokes of its gameplay and the more isolated story beats in the game.",,,,,,"Kingdom Hearts 3 ends the current era of the series wonderfully. It ties many once-confusing parts of the narrative together. The story still has a few cumbersome points, but a lot of effort has gone into making the obtuse narrative easier to follow. The end result is the finest entry in the series in many ways, with stunning graphics and whimsical sound design. Kingdom Hearts 3 takes many elements from the first game’s structure and is better for it, with a greater emphasis on the Disney side of things that has been seen in over a decade, and some nice gameplay improvements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The pulsating heart of the product is in fact also represented by the wanderings of the hero through the brilliant licenses Disney and Pixar, capable of supporting and embellishing a fresco so undoubtedly epic but also imperfect, wounded by the gears of time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There’s a sense of finality to it – from the very start, it feels like the end of something epic and carries that feeling throughout the entire game. Superfans are going to be thrilled at every turn and newcomers will appreciate the bizarre, unmatched genre-blend of Disney and anime culture. Kingdom Hearts 3 is still some of the most genuine and wholesome fun I’ve had in thirteen years, and even though to some degree it is more of the same that we’ve seen from past titles with more polish, finesse, and technological magic, but in a way, that’s what makes it feel like home.","It doesn’t quite reach the level of quality found in Kingdom Hearts II (which I don’t particularly think is fair because I don’t like to compare a sequel to its predecessor when said predecessor was one of the best games ever made), but I find it hard to believe that any fan of this series would walk away from Kingdom Hearts III unsatisfied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"So, has the decade long wait for this anticipated sequel lived up to all the hype? It’s hard to say. I did enjoy my 30 hours with it by the time the credits rolled, and can easily go back for another 50+ hours for bonus stuff should I desire in the future. It’s such an odd feeling to finally have some closure and finality to the series I’ve been enjoying for almost two decades, but it’s finally time to say goodbye to this chapter of Kingdom Hearts and await to see what comes next, hopefully with a much shorter wait this time around and a much more concise way of storytelling.","There is so much game here in Kingdom Hearts 3, and it’s all coming from the mind of an auteur with far too much power. But if you dare to take that plunge, as much of an investment as it is, there is a great adventure to be had here. So much adventure. Probably too much. After all, this isn’t really Kingdom Hearts 3. It’s more like, seven, or ten, or something.",,,,,,,,,,"Kingdom Hearts III is a dazzling display from Square Enix; the best game in the universe, and among the best from the legendary studio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The game pitches itself as the finale to a series so many have grown up with, but it hasn’t matured with its audience or video games as a medium.",,,It is a museum exhibiting its own architecture.

However, there is so much that you need to unlock in the game to try and balance the difficulty in your favour to even complete the first dungeon. This, in turn, ruins the experience by having to play the same dungeon over and over. It is a shame that the same level of effort that was put into the story line was not put into the gameplay, things becomes repetitive quite quickly.",,,"Even if not resulting in a too original and memorable experience, Children of Morta successfully mixes several genres like the rogue-like and Diablo-like ones, delivery a satisfying gameplay with fascinating pixel art animations.","Children of Morta is the perfect game for RPG fans.

With proper attention, Ubisoft could easily pivot the game towards the vision it represents. We can only hope that The Division's long-term story is just beginning.","In its current state The Division works best as a finite game, an experience where its longevity will rely almost completely on post-release support and content. But, if you find yourself spending minutes going through all your latest purple items after a few successful high-level Dark Zone extractions, then you’ll probably be excited to find out what that content will be.",,,,"Both in combat and out, there are some clearly good ideas, especially the tense and dangerous Dark Zone.

They might have similarities to others that they have followed in their footsteps, but everything looks to be coming together extremely well and I have faith in the Division’s future.",,,,"A co-op, third-person cover shooter with a whole load of loot-based, ability upgrading, gear crafting, stat levelling stuff built in, The Division is an entertaining game. If you want to play through all the content and move on, you’ll have a good time.

But The Division gets shooting and encounters right in ways plenty of other games have tried and failed, building a basis for a truly social tactical shooter.",,"The Division doesn't have many ideas of its own, but the way it unites traditional open-world design with online multiplayer makes it an addictive social shooter. The repetition does wear thin after a while, and the end-game content isn't as robust as it needs to be, so there's a legitimate concern as to whether the game will remain engrossing in the long run. Still, Ubisoft has erected a solid foundation.",,,"The Division is an ambitious game when it comes to the world it creates and its mechanics, for both cooperative play and Player versus Player, are solid and engaging but much of its future will depend on how Ubisoft caters to the needs of the community and to the unique ways in which players come to enjoy this beautiful and derelict world of New York.",,,,,,,"If you can accept its myriad tonal inconsistencies and buy into the bullet-sponge combat, The Division is an intriguing social shooter that taps into the addictiveness of loot grinding in a novel setting.",,,,,,,,,"The Division is big, fun, intense, deep... the list goes on and on.

The side missions didn't need to be as repetitive as they are, and that's disappointing. But there's a real foundation here that makes this worth paying some attention to, provided you don't intend to just shoot your way through the missions by yourself.",,,,,"The Division is a strong start for a game that Ubisoft is clearly aiming to keep alive for a long time. It gleefully fulfills promises instead of just making them, even if some of its later elements fall prey to the inevitable wait for more content.",,,"It's a squad-based game that just happens to take place in an open world, and that's basically it. I don't see Division lasting as long as other, similar games either months down the line, as it simply doesn't allow for anything on a raid-like level to truly hook in the dedicated crowd.",,,,"Ubisoft has something with serious potential, and it'll be intriguing to see what shape this world takes.",,It’s not perfect but it’s one of the best online titles ever released.,"What’s here right now is thoroughly engaging.

But for now the game lacks high level content, making the experience a bit repetitive in the end.","Watch Dogs, Assassin’s Creed, and now The Division are all the kinds of worlds I love to lose myself in.

However, it isn’t looking too likely that The Division is going to take over as my next “gaming addiction” the way I’m sure Ubisoft were hoping it would.",,,,"Describing The Division, much like playing it, feels a lot like compiling and checking off a series of lists. There’s a lot of stuff on those lists, for sure, but very little to actually do. What you do, overwhelmingly, is shoot things. Sometimes you’re shooting at napalm canisters, sometimes at rioters armed with baseball bats and hoodies. Sometimes you find them, and sometimes they come to you while defending whatever it was you activated by holding the X button. As a reward, your numbers — armor, DPS, ability power, etc. — go up in order to help you shoot things even better next time...It’s an old formula, and often a good one, but one that still feels strange in the context of a shooter (even in this post-Destiny world).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We have a huge city at our disposal, many hours of fun and possibilities of replaying the game either alone or with friends.

No doubt there will be many more horrific challenges in their way, but I am eager to see how things pan out. Life is Strange 2 is off to a great start.","Unfortunately the episode is let down by the less than subtle way it deals with delicate subjects like racism, as well as gameplay that means this episode feels like quite a slow start to the story. There are several hints throughout the episode to suggest the gameplay may be spiced up in the future, and it may need it if players are going to make it through to the end of the story.",,"An even stronger and thought-provoking experience than the first game, with a brilliant soundtrack and improved graphics, while Dontnod reaffirms their storytelling ability.

Loaded with a strong political message the game forgets to work on its main plot.,,,"Life is Strange 2 features a story that packs real emotional weight, and one that surprisingly deals with real-world issues in a way that feels like a milestone achievement in interactive storytelling. But, by that same token it is indeed more of an interactive piece of cinema than traditional game. Here’s hoping that the next few episodes provide real tangible ways to interact with the world, from puzzles, to traversal, to even some form of action.","The indie soundtrack that accompanies your time with Life is Strange 2 Episode 1 is both melancholic and atmospheric, matching the mood of the story perfectly. As to be expected from a Life is Strange game, the dialogue and voice acting are spot on and I felt fully immersed in the lives of Sean and Daniel.",,,"Though its social criticisms feel broad and rather clumsy so far, its core story of brotherhood and fraternity between two believable characters is already enormously touching.",,,The gameplay feels a little too one-dimensional at this moment and really required an added twist. But Roads sets up some intriguing plot points which I’m really excited to see unfold in later episodes of Life is Strange 2.,,,,,,,"Life is Strange 2 does not take advantage of the choices that would bring forth different situations during the episode 1.

Elite: Dangerous offers an experience like no other, it’s just a shame the sins of the past still sting as painfully as they did on PC.",,,"Elite: Dangerous is a phenomenal piece of simulation software, masquerading as a game. I felt like Mal Reynolds, Captain Picard and Luke Skywalker at various points, while at others I felt like a delivery man who was able to make a cup of tea whilst travelling to the next drop off. The emptiness of space can be overwhelming, and Elite: Dangerous revels in that a little too much, but for the brave, or foolhardy, it offers an experience that is unlike anything else on Xbox One.",,,,,Elite Dangerous for Xbox One is the ultimate spaceship simulator. Its huge changing universe and its PvP modes make Frontier's game a very interesting option if you love sci-fi.,,,,,,,,"It's not easy to get into and doesn't include a story, but if you persevere Elite: Dangerous is the best available space opera.","Elite: Dangerous isn’t a terrible game, but I don’t think it was made for mass appeal.",,,"The console version of Elite: Dangerous is more or less the same title you can play on PC. The controls are mapped perfectly on the game pad and the visuals are as astounding as the deep space, but it's still a very difficult game.",,"Elite: Dangerous is a well-made space sim with incredible scope and wondrous plans for the future, but it might put off some players with its complexity.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Elite Dangerous offers gamers a seemingly unlimited amount of gameplay, and this is reinforced when you settle in and see how titanic the scale and size of the game environment actually is with the amount of possibilities and opportunities that are provided.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Elite Dangerous is a very cool, atmospheric experience with an outstanding presentation. The flexible gameplay and progression loop are two great reasons to keep coming back for more if the game's mechanics click for you. However, it is easy to see why some people might be turned off by its aimlessness, and with the lacking narrative contextualising what you're doing, you might be left with the nihilistic question of why you're bothering doing anything at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"On a technical level, Elite: Dangerous nearly pulls off the impossible task of dazzling on par with its predecessor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Challenging combat is just one of the high points of ED.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
salt-and-sanctuary,"Salt and Sanctuary offers a notably different experience from the Souls games anyway, simply because it’s presented side-on, but here in 2019, it faces some seriously tough competition in that space. Compared to Dead Cells, its combat feels positively sluggish, and its map can’t hold a gloomy candle to the exploratory delights of Hollow Knight.",,,,,"It would be all too easy to compare this to the Souls series, but in truth, Salt and Sanctuary deserves a spotlight entirely of its own. It’s a dark and twisted journey that constantly relays a remarkable amount of depth, variety, innovation, and detail. Its greatest achievement, however, is not that of its outstanding structure, but its ability to frequently entice its players, despite how often it screws them over. This, is a punishing must have.",,,,,,,,"Salt and Sanctuary on Xbox One isn’t for everyone; its high difficulty can easily put off many players. Failing on the same spot, again and again, might become disheartening. But learning the patterns and approaching each scenario with patience reinvigorates your stride. Those who manage to overcome these obstacles will likely discover a rewarding 2D souls-like experience with an immense amount of various customization options, including weapons, armour, accessories, and Creeds to accommodate your preferred play style.",,,,,,,"Salt and Sanctuary isn’t the most original game in the world, but Ska Studio’s take on a 2D Souls game has enough going for it to stand on its own two legs. It’s held back somewhat by occasionally cheap difficulty spikes, but that shouldn't deter you from picking the game up if you’re looking for a game that will kick your ass.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Even if the One version didn’t get any enhancements or improvements: This is not only a loving homage to, but still the best direct interpretation of the Souls games as a 2D platformer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Salt and Sanctuary is a compelling game because of the enormous world and the many challenges it offers. The game kills you with every mistake you make and you want to keep coming back for more. This is a must buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I completely appreciate and understand what Salt and Sanctuary is accomplishing and trying to be. While some will be turned off by its difficulty, the elation that comes when you finally become better skilled and progress is unlike any other. Salt and Sanctuary isn’t simply a 2D Souls-like, as it has its own creative merits and is its own experience, something that needs to be applauded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An absence of gameplay differences between characters is frustrating and the solo campaign mode is far too insubstantial, but the versus arena is engagingly chaotic, if short-lived. Online multiplayer would have elevated this game to another level, but local play is still a lot of fun if you and your friends like to duke it out once in a while.",,"A highly entertaining and challenging 2D competitive game, with a simple and frantic gameplay and lots of levels. Too bad for its lack of online multiplayer, but if you've got friends to play with at home you'll find it to be incredibly absorbing.","Towerfall Ascension’s main appeal is as an amusing game, and that’s the best thing we can say about a videogame. But not even its great gameplay aspect nor its charming retro visual style can avoid that feeling of missing something as essential as an online multiplayer mode.","Towerfall Ascension is a very fun game to play on your own, but it was created to be enjoyed in the company of other players. The multiplayer experience is local, it is crazy and very addictive. The controls are simple yet challenging, and it has a retro look that will appeal to many of the mature players, especially those who like the classic games.",,,"TowerFall is certainly a very good local multiplayer game that a group of friends can enjoy night after night, honing their skills with the virtual bow and arrow.

The story mode's focus on in-the-trenches brotherhood falls short of its mark due to introducing a dozen or so characters and only getting a few of them to stand out. However, if you're coming back to the series annually you're probably in it for its other two modes, multiplayer and zombies. In both instances, they innovate in fun ways. At times, it does feel like the whole package benefits from the simple timeline swap. If you gave up on the franchise's small maps and repetitive story structure, WWII doesn't do enough to make you want to come back. It remains true to itself, for better or worse. For anyone who still plays the games with glee every November, Call of Duty: WWII is a better-late-than-never return to the series' roots.",,"A welcome return to the origins for Call of Duty, with an immersive campaign and a classic multiplayer. The new Zombi mode is the one that feels more improved and a step forward, while multiplayer could have used a bit more of innovation, but it's still highly enjoyable.","Call of Duty WWII isn’t a perfect game, but it is a solid one. What we really miss is a graphical upgrade on its engine and a campaign mode with more personality. Feels good to be back at World War II with the great gameplay that the game offers, its multiplayer and the always fun zombie mode.","With the Call of Duty series, we demand and meet a high level of quality that always makes it a safe purchase. However, even though the social zone and all that it entails are trying to be the greatest novelty, it is the multiplayer's War mode that really offers a fun and innovative challenge.","The campaign production values are amazing as always, with excellent acting and motion capture, huge set pieces, and a fair bit of variety. And of course, WWII shows serious dedication to multiplayer with the new headquarters social hub, the excellent new war mode, and a gritty co-op Zombies mode. Whether you're interested in campaign or multiplayer, Call of Duty: WWII is the complete package and a must-play first-person shooter this holiday season.",,Call of Duty: WWII is most definitely a more than decent entry to the franchise.

You will want to try.,"With the freemium model, SMITE is worth trying out if you’re a MOBA fan with an Xbox One.

nba-2k20,,,,,,"The shame of all this is that without these practices, NBA 2K20 can stand tall as the best basketball sim available. Even running unopposed with the retirement of the NBA Live franchise, it continues to get better and better on the court, but serious issues surrounding that experience leave it feeling less and less impressive year on year. Here’s hoping 2K can end that trend.",,"This game is designed to get you to pay out as much money as possible, as often as possible, and it just so happens to be built around basketball. Admittedly, the basketball here is quite solid, but more often than not it feels like an afterthought to the main, casino-tinged event.","2K keeps in improving its NBA game, adding more depth and strategy to its gameplay and greatly boosting its career mode. Invasive microtransactions and the lack of online play for the WNBA teams just keep it from reaching higher grounds.",NBA 2K20 is once again the best exponent of the genre. The novelties included in its modes are only stained by some very intrusive microtransactions.,"NBA 2K20 has made it again. The title of 2K Games comes with enough new features for veterans to feel and evolution and the simplicity necessary to catch the newbies. Thus, the title par excellence of basketball stands, one more year, as one of the most complete sports games on the market.",,,"The aesthetics and physics are the best I’ve ever experienced in a basketball game, the customisation and level of detail in created players and icons from the league is simply stunning, and the sheer volume of game modes to chose from is incredible. The huge downside to this game though is the greed from 2K who only want you for your money, making it purposefully hard to improve in MyTeam unless you bow to this.",,,,"There's a big, impressive game to sink your teeth into with 2K20, even if it tastes a bit like 2k19.",,"If you’re a huge basketball fan then of course you’re going to want to buy NBA 2K20, warts and all. But you should probably ask yourself, “do you need to?”. If you just want to play basketball, NBA 2K19 does the job nearly almost as well – and you can pick that up for peanuts if you don’t already own it. NBA 2K20‘s MyCareer is a huge disappointment, and other modes have had minor improvements at best. All you’re really paying for is roster updates, WNBA and the opportunity to buy more VC. If that sounds like a good deal to you then jump in, but it really shouldn’t.",,,"Overall, NBA 2K20 is still the best basketball game on the planet and that doesn’t look to be changing any time soon. While some fans may be upset about microtransactions, it’s not a requirement to play the game. At this point, however, it seems like as long as NBA 2K is the best game out there, microtransactions will be here to stay.",,,"NBA 2K20 is so similar to last year's game that it's hard to wholeheartedly recommend it like we normally would. If you haven't bought an NBA 2K game in a while, then by all means, don't hesitate to dive right in. But if you're still happily playing NBA 2K19, there's really no reason to make the switch. Major, sweeping changes are clearly in order, and we hope to see big things happening for NBA 2K21.","NBA 2K20 doesn’t go over the edge, it doesn’t bring much novelty to the series.

The game does have its issues, but as of writing, a lot of the glitches I saw seem to have been addressed. My biggest gripe (and I know I’m not alone) is the amount of emphasis placed on VC each year, and how it feels even more off-putting this year. It takes away from what is such a beautiful and well-crafted game.

Drivatar technology needs to be implemented into every game as soon as possible, and people looking for a fantastic looking driving game need look no further.

Couple this with a dismal launch lineup of cars and tracks, and this is a surprising step backward for the Forza franchise as it helps kick off Microsoft’s next-gen console.","Impossibly smooth and good-looking, it's just a shame it doesn't play as well as Forza 4. [Jan 2014, p.58]",,"Forza 5 will do as a holdover racing game for now, but for all the bombast that next-gen brings, the game is awfully stagnant, and its lack of competition has never been more apparent.","There’s no way to sell unused cars back to the AI or to other players, no bespoke onscreen speedometers, no test driving a car before purchase, no kid-friendly Kinect steering or Kinect support in Forzavista, no opportunity to load a circuit-specific tuning setup before a career race, no exiting from a race series without loading up the next track, no unicorn cars, no ‘reasonably priced car’, no auction house, no storefront, and no surprise, really.","Forza Motorsport 5 is quite simply car porn running at 1080p, 60fps. Visually stunning and without a rival on the next gen stage.","The previous title in this series is still to many the most complete racing simulator ever made, but Forza 5 exceeds it in several ways - not enough to displace it, but enough to fully merit its place on the Forza podium.

It holds players back with a number of cars locked behind micro transactions though, as well as not having enough tracks.",,,,,"We thought we would be astonished by Forza Motorsport 5, but Turn 10 only filled the requirement boxes forgetting that the goal was to make a car sim that could be a system seller. We won't say that game could have been made on Xbox 360 but we were expecting a revolution not just a nice looking game. On the bright side, we have to mention Drivatar which is born to be a classic in future games, and the gameplay, still at it's best in terms of precision. Turn 10 seems a bit sleepy on this title, not a crime but beware.",,,"I came away wishing it had been something more. I was hoping for a racing simulation that didn’t just look next-generation, but also felt next-generation in the way it played.

Turn 10 does a lot of good things in their first game for the next-gen consoles, like the handling of the cars and variety in game modes. Unfortunately they miss the mark in game content - like tracks and cars - and modes like the multiplayer are disappointing. This is a pity, because it leaves a stain on an otherwise amusing race game.","While Forza Motorsport 5 is a strong launch-day title for Xbox One, it has more style than substance and serves better as a foundation for future next-gen Forza Motorsport titles than the limited sampler that it really is.",,,,"In the end this game could have indeed been a bit more, but what is there is damn good and driving fans will be impressed that is for sure. Make no bones about it, Forza Motorsport 5 should be a game that you should definitely consider when buying your shiny new Xbox One.",,"Forza Motorsport 5 is what die hard fans of turn 10 deserve. Stunning visuals and great sim-like handling are the highlights of the game, but we need more tracks and cars.",,"It’s refreshing to play a racing game that doesn’t feel stale when played alone, and that’s all thanks to Drivatar keeping things fresh every time you race.","If you’ve got a next-gen console and you’re into racing simulators, it’s your only choice - and it’s far from a bad one.

It has an excellent driving model and superb graphics, but lack of some basic elements and the publisher's greed, that makes gamers pay lots of extra money for something that should be free, are really serious flaws. In case this extra content is made available for free, I will happily modify my opinion.","Forza Motorsport 5 is not a bad racing game per se, but it feels kinda downgraded from the expansive Forza games of Xbox 360. The graphics are fancy, but that doesn't quite compensate the (relative) lack of cars and tracks.

On one hand it impresses on the track with good visuals and fantastic handling. On the other hand it lacks content and the career mode is very dull outside of the races.,"It's quite possibly the best looking next-gen title. Hardcore fans will enjoy it to its full extent, but it's fairly forgiving to newcomers as well. There's just not a ton of middle ground, you'll either really love it or not be interested at all.",,,,,,,"So while a handful of dings and scrapes will unquestionably set some teeth on edge, Forza Motorsport 5 remains a fantastic opening salvo in the battle of the Xbox One racers.","One of the best comedic diversions in Forza 5 is a trip through the Top Gear test track, this time set to a tongue-in-cheek London simulation mode. Some say that some variant of the Stig is also represented somewhere in the game ... though it's probably too nice to be his Drivatar.","Forza 5 is as spectacular and solid as ever, but you can't ignore the fact that there's a clear content cutback from the previous game.",,"If you thrive on variety, your patience with Forza 5 will wear thin in ten hours or so… and the idea that DLC may fill out the experience sometime in the future isn’t very comforting. That’s tragic, because Forza 5 is one of the most gorgeous and best-feeling racers I’ve ever played.","Technically impressive, but limited on new ideas. Drivatar is the closest to innovation Forza 5 comes, but needs more depth to be worthwhile.","A fantastic driving game for fans of the genre, but it takes almost no chances. It’s content to drive a straight line, which is a little disappointing given that we’re now supposed to be at the dawn of a new era of gaming. If anything, last year’s Forza Horizon – which featured an open world and a storyline on top of the series’ usual car fetishism – was a much bolder and more exciting game. In retrospect, it might have been the better showcase for the next generation.","Looks lovely, drives great but feels more like a Forza Light.",,,,,,,,,,,,So much of the experience is locked off due to an inbalanced in-game economy and even more has just been cut entirely. Forza 5 was just good enough enough to keep me from going back to Forza 4: the addition of drivatars and the desire to compete for slots on the global leader board in particular just managed to keep me invested.,,,,,"With a few fixes to its economy and more free tracks in a future update, Forza 5 will grow into one of the best racing games ever made. It’s beautiful, it shows off the designs of vehicles in a way that’s never been done before, and the Top Gear license is used to enhance the experience. If you’re a casual racing fan who finds themselves overwhelmed easily, Forza 5 is your huckleberry.","Beyond that, this serves as a solid, fun-feeling sim-ish racing game with hundreds of well-modeled cars, innovative AI, and some great tracks.",,,

Creepy visuals and audio suck us in, and some smart, well-paced puzzles and set pieces keep us hooked for the duration.

A strange, creepy delight of a game, Little Nightmares 2 deserves to stand out as one of the best releases of the year.","With Little Nightmares 2 Tarsier Studios has once again dreamt up a wonderfully unnerving world filled with grotesque and fantastical creatures that is a horrifying pleasure to explore. Gameplay is mostly the same as in the original, with the only significant exceptions being the addition of Six as an AI companion and some clumsy combat that actually feels more like a puzzle than anything else.

It's also a bit too long, occasionally frustrating and, in one key moment, inaccessible for players who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. But, overall, it represents a successful follow-up from Tarsier. With inventive puzzle design and some startlingly original levels, it isn't quite a dream come true, but it certainly won't have you waking up, bolt upright, screaming, in a cold sweat.",,,,,,,"Little Nightmares II is bigger and bolder, which builds upon the foundations from the first game. The game is host to a disgusting, decaying world that opens up as you progress through each chapter. Its inhabitants will haunt your dreams for days and the emotional connection it draws between Mono and Six with absolutely no dialogue is powerful. It's a shame that frustrating chase sequences and clunky combat scenarios consistently break the immersion, as the game is just shy of being something truly special. As it stands, Little Nightmares II is a thrill ride filled with visual striking moments of pure nightmare fuel, which may invite you to leave your lamp on for the foreseeable future.",,,,,,,,,,This impressive follow-up builds on its predecessor with emotional gut punches and unnerving visuals that stick with you.,,,,"Little Nightmares 2 is certainly polished and beautifully stylised, but it didn’t offer me a new experience.

In addition, it also improved the frustrating controls the original had, and finally, it gave fans what they wanted the most: a detail-filled narrative that is ready to be minced and interpreted from various standpoints, for years to come. Introducing a forced co-op with the machine and ""combat"" sounds controversial for a horror franchise that worked so well without it, but surprisingly, these new mechanics made it feel like an evolution from the original formula.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drawing oodles of inspiration from acclaimed coin-op kings like Virtua Racing, Daytona USA, and Ridge Racer, Hotshot Racing is confident, quick, and boasts a cracking arcade handling model, although its tracks are mostly simple and cause it to quickly lose a bit of steam as a single-player experience.",,,"If, like me, you’ve been waiting what feels like forever for a new Ridge Racer game to be announced, I really do recommend that you give Hotshot Racing a go. There are some elements of it that don’t quite align with Bandai Namco’s premier arcade racing series, but it lets you get sideways in a range of wonderful locations, and challenges you to carefully use your boost to remain at the front of the pack. I don’t know about you, but that’s something I’ve been craving.",,"The visuals are absolutely incredible. As mentioned, the stages really pop, and the thick defined polygons really capture that 90s feel. The game runs at a wonderful clip and the colors simply pop off the screen. The music is fun, and the characters all have unique attitudes, even if they wear out their welcome quickly. Hotshot Racing is an incredible nostalgia trip that I cannot recommend enough. Game Pass owners should note that the game is included in Microsoft’s service, so there is no excuse not to give it a try. This is the most fun I have had with a racing game in quite some time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Both a very nice tribute to Virtua Racing and a good arcade racing game per-se, Hotshot Racing is a nice single-player experience and a surprising multiplayer package.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Retro racers definitely don't get much better than Hotshot Racing so if you have a fondness for racing in the '90s, you're sure to love it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Beautiful looking, challenging racing game that recreates all the things you love about arcade racers.

A great new IP with a huge potential.",,,,,"For Honor's learning curve can be punishing at first, but if you're willing to stay the course and invest some time into understanding the nuances of its deep combat system, you will begin to appreciate how exciting and truly addictive the ""Art of Battle"" can be.",,"Ubisoft's bet on a multiplayer-focused medieval brawler has been fully won thanks to a deep and tactical combat system and lots of choices for the player, even if it hit some bumps with a pretty unstable netcode and an underwhelming campaign.","The experience can vary depending on the game mode.

But when For Honor shines, the feeling it provides is authentic and brutal.",For Honor is a remarkable game with a deep combat system.

For Honor is a safe bet to have fun alone and even more with your friends.,,"There are memorable flashes of brilliance when playing the multiplayer modes, and you come up against another player. And through sheer skill and understanding of the combat, you’re able to gain the upper hand in a heated and intense exchange of metal.","For Honor is a game that I am not even close to finishing with. Its campaign is big enough to not feel tacked on, but the draw of the multiplayer action keeps dragging me away from finishing it. I can feel my skills improving after every round because it’s a new way to play against other players and that deserves highlighting in a highly saturated section of the market.",,,"For Honor has some dents in its shiny armor, such as the mediocre campaign, the frugal economy, and the snowballing victories in team modes. But it’s hard to be mad too long when I consider that the melee combat system is second to none and a joy to learn, take your licks, and then learn some more. I could feel myself becoming a better warrior with this deep, flexible, and complete fighting system. The more I play For Honor, the more I want to play For Honor.","For Honor offers up one of the most visceral multiplayer experiences in video games.

Like Siege, For Honor is in the beginning stages of becoming something truly unique and brilliant. If you’ve ever struggled to get into fighting games, are eager for a new multiplayer game to try your hand at, or are simply interested in what happens when Ubisoft diverts its resources out of populating open worlds with content and into an experience that thrives because of its nuanced design, then try For Honor – you won’t regret it.",,,,,,,"For Honor is great fun, but like any fighting game, it’ll only reach its true potential if players stick around for the long haul. It takes time for experts to develop high-level strategies, and for that knowledge to trickle down to the rest of the community, and as such it’ll be a few months before it’s clear whether or not the game can stand among the current titans of the genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For Honor is a real surprise. In terms of gameplay mechanics it’s top-notch, visually it’s excellent, and there’s a decent if fairly formulaic campaign to play through. It’s in For Honor’s multifaceted multiplayer, however, where Ubisoft has has struck gold. Testing your combat knowledge against real players, either in one-on-one duels or in large conquest-style battles, is both thrilling and unique in the action genre.","For Honor does a great job trying to find a new way of telling a very old and very familiar story. It accomplishes so much that it does provide an entertaining way to push you through the repetition of a hack and slash game. However, when you least expect it, you get impaled right through the heart by a broken multiplayer experience where the fragments of microtransactions and more splinter through the game, and while the blow isn't fatal now, if the connection issues aren't addressed, it will be.","If For Honor were a game that [] didn’t rely so heavily on its internet connection, I could rave about it for hours. It is beautiful. The move sets for each character are well thought out and balanced, meaning people who put in enough effort will succeed with any of the available heroes. The campaign offers an interesting enough solo experience that lets people gradually face greater challenges. The multiplayer is extraordinary, when it’s working properly. It’s just that Ubisoft has once again not anticipated the needs of a game such as this. I feel like peer-to-peer wasn’t the right system for such a game, and that it would have been better for everyone if this had been a client-server game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pacer,,,,,,"All in all, Pacer is about as close as we’re likely to get to a new Wipeout; that is to say, its fantastic sense of speed and style evoke the same feeling I got when playing the 1995 classic. Even on the slower speeds things move briskly, but up it to the Elite class and we’re in for a eye-wateringly fast racer that looks great and controls perfectly. A few confusing UI elements aside, this is well worth a look.",,,,,"Ships that literally defy gravity, speed, shooting and constant action are the condiments that make Pacer a worthy exponent of the futuristic driving genre.",,,"It’s easy to recommend what R8 Games have created here. Pacer is quite possibly the finest anti-grav racer available on Xbox - a slick, smooth, super fast roller coaster of a game that lets you go as deep as you want, in more ways than one. If you’ve been hanging on for a Wipeout beater, you’ll still be waiting, but this is about as close as it gets to a modern day anti-grav masterpiece.",,,,,,,,"Pacer is a good game on its own merits but it is nothing special, and when Wipeout HD Collection is still being sold for half the price of Pacer (and the other titles I mentioned at the beginning of this review are also less than Pacer) it is extremely hard to say this game that is just “good” is worth your money when competitors are out there for less. Pacer does not exist in a vacuum, and therefore I can not recommend it over other Wipeout inspired titles, which there is at least one on every current platform.",,,,,"If you're tired of going around in circles on the twelve tracks of WipEout HD and its Fury expansion or if you're just a thrill-seeker, Pacer is for you. Even if it does not manage to overtake the master, it will charm you with its inspired artistic direction, its substantial content or its sensations of speed. But you have been warned, while R8 Games' production has many qualities, the title also delivers many shortcomings. The handling of the game lacks precision, especially in the highest difficulties where it will necessarily be necessary to play double airbrakes to hope to escape unscathed, the HUD is particularly intrusive and the menus are not very ergonomic.",,,,,,,,,"It all feels good in practice, and you can compete in quick races, online multiplayer, and a primarily story-less, but nevertheless enjoyable enough career mode. Some of the races are definitely more engaging than others though, with more standard races tending to be the most thrilling, whereas events focused around destroying other players, for example, are a bit too hectic and luck-driven to get overly excited about. Pacer is at its best when you're flying past other racers at ultra high speeds, rather than being forced to follow other objectives such as destroying them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pacer successfully fills a gap in the market for high speed, anti-gravity racers. Those who are wishing for an experience reminiscent of the Wipeout series will be pleased on how this project has turned out. Tight and precise controls, matched up with a large assortment of maps and customised crafts makes for a very fulfilling experience. Issues such as those posed by hard-to-reach weapons can be overcome by practising and improving knowledge of each turn in every track - alas the lacklustre sound effects from the crafts is seemingly all that is available. These tiny issues aside Pacer makes good on its promise, even if it took a long time to get there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For all its faults and missteps, Pacer is a strong, gloriously addictive debut; all R8 Games needs to do is iron out its issues with a few patches, then hit us with a killer sequel or two–just like Psygnosis did with the immortal Wipeout 2097 and Wip3out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pacer’s lacklustre career mode and some dodgy event types might be turn-offs, but the core racing gameplay makes up for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fast, slick but with a few too many flaws, Pacer is nevertheless a fine futuristic racer.",,,,,,,,"Pacer is a glorious return to the F-Zero-style arcade racer.

The battle royale formula is intact, albeit some of the aspects that usually make it so exciting and replayable are muted here. I’d love to see a reason to try something other than my Modern Warfare multiplayer loadout in the future given how easy it is to acquire, and think that the armor plate system and gulag are in need of revision. But my time spent in Verdask was still supremely fun even if the how and the why of it didn’t matter all that much.",,,,,,,,,,Quotation forthcoming.,,"Warzone is a great sophomore attempt at a battle royale from Call of Duty, which finally manages to carve out its own identity with interesting spins on the existing formula. Its subversion of death and the nail-biting Gulag duels give you more ways to stay in a match, while also forcing you to be aware of your surroundings even after wiping a rival squad. Its looting is streamlined enough to make early moments feel fast, but Warzone also loses some of the messy magic from hobbled together loadouts by letting you drop in prebuilt ones far too easily and frequently. Still, if you're comfortable with Call of Duty's latest iteration of multiplayer antics and thrive in the stressful setting of battle royales, Warzone is a strong contender for your attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Call of Duty: Warzone is a natural and worthy successor to Black Ops 4’s Blackout —one that grows strong in its predecessor’s innovations and sense of action but one that also addresses the most common flaws in your average battle royale games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Call of Duty: Warzone is a top tier battle royale game and its early player numbers are reflective of that.

Chloe is struggling to come to terms with the events of the last couple of years, but her burgeoning relationship with Rachel Amber looks set to change all that. When it comes to moral decisions, the options may not always make sense with Chloe and some awkwardness can ensue, but this is a minor issue in an otherwise solid episode, especially when the new BackTalk mechanic is very fitting and adds some realism to conversations. Depending on how much you like surprises, familiarity and prior knowledge from Life Is Strange can be either a blessing or a boon, but regardless of this, Chloe's new (old?) adventure looks to be a fascinating storyline to follow into the remaining two episodes.",,"This new adventure nails the overall mood of the series, while introducing an interesting ""word fight"" mechanic in replacement of the absent time rewind power. It lacks intense and adrenalinic moments like those in the original series, though: we hope to see more of those in the next two chapters.",Life is Strange: Before the Storm Episode 1 is a conservative proposal on the saga. The game will be more enjoyable for those who like the classic adventure genre. The fans of the original Life is Strange will discover in Before the Storm the beginning of the friendship between Chloe and Rachel that will add backstory on the punk girl.,Life Is Strange: Before the Storm follows the path of what became the first title in 2015. Deck Nine has done the work of developing a graphic adventure to meet the expectations of fans but with the virtues and shortcomings of the previous title. Anyway is an ingenious proposal of mechanics that the most educated fans will love.,,"For fans of Life is Strange it’s no doubt worth your time, and the way in which Chloe and Rachel’s relationship evolves over the course of the first episode is a pleasure to watch. No so well done though, is all the supernatural stuff. Which fails to reach the same heights of the original, and feels a little forced.","Yes it has some serious pacing issues and the long conversations where you don’t seem to be doing much can grate. But the gameplay is solid, with some interesting extras and it still looks very pretty indeed.",,,,,,"As an introductory episode to a three-part series, Awake absolutely nails it. The action that takes place is pretty low-key — don’t run into Before the Storm expecting epic adventure sequences — but it’s a perfect return to Arcadia Bay.",,"This is just the first episode in a 3 part arc and it left me wanting more. While there is no time element here to mess with, the backtalk is interesting enough. Though story wise, there might be something going on, more than meets the eye if the end moments are any indication. Deck Nine has taken the franchise and totally captured what fans of the first game loved about it. The dialog, story, and drama that comes with it all. While there were a few moments of framerate stutter on the Xbox One, it was very few and far between. Otherwise, this was a solid first episode and if the quality keeps up, the entire prequel will be a nice companion pieces to the original game. Hopefully not taken anything away from it, but only adding more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Awake shows you a broken Chloe - someone at her lowest. Everyone hits those trying times in their lives, and what Awake does best is illustrate how much another person can make a difference in those situations. The emotional pull is strong, and the story's strength is its relatability. This first episode has me intrigued at how Chloe and Rachel Amber will make it through their distress, and it also has me rooting for them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Before the Storm's first chapter has already deflected most of the pre-release concerns that ""This doesn't need to exist."" Maybe it doesn't because Life is Strange's story was self-contained. Then again, maybe Life is Strange is better off with this complementing it. After its debut, I'm fully willing to argue that Before the Storm deserves to exist because this story is important too. In true Chloe fashion, anyone who disagrees gets two one-finger salutes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Life is Strange Before the Storm is certainly a game for people who love a good story.

killing-floor-2,,,,,,,,,,"Blood, zombies and a lot of adrenaline waits us in Killing Floor 2, a game that fans of cooperative modes will love. The game delivers a frenetic proposal that will offer many and many hours of fun.",Killing Floor 2 arrives on Xbox One with a port from PC that is quite correct but not solid if we talk about technical aspects. The gameplay remains intact keeping the fun above all the blood that will fall to us.,"If you like tough cooperative experiences, it really is a joy. The game naturally encourages everyone to stick together in large or small groups, watching each other's backs and using class abilities to help the team. The 15 levels are all excellent and memorable (despite the lack of environmental interactivity), providing the sense of variety that the bosses do not. With tons of classes to level and weapons to wield, Killing Floor 2 has some serious staying power. Tripwire has announced Xbox One X enhancements, too, which will keep the game going even longer.",,,,,,,,,,"Killing Floor 2 is a lot of mindless fun. I say mindless, but it really does take some strategy to be successful. That’s what makes it the most fun. The only thing I must warn people about is the fact that if you’re thinking of going into this game solo, it’s going to be an uphill battle that will quickly get old. This game is best experienced in co-op with some friends. Even if you don’t have friends to play with, the game’s matchmaking system is strong and works well and people are generally decent to play with. People looking for some co-op fun will find a great time here and I believe it is well worth the price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A solid and bloody zombie hunt, that neither offers server browser or user content, but makes up for it with bonus material and integrated DLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite being released almost one year ago on PC and PS4, this online shooter with horror elements makes its debut on Xbox One with all of the previously released content and some limited-time exclusive skins for weapons and characters.",,"When I first started up Killing Floor 2 I had no idea what to expect. The game looked like a very grim, zombie-killing game. What it actually was - a ridiculously impressive and immersive strategy game… that was very grim. There are a few technicalities, but overall there is nothing out there that gives you such a feeling of fight-or-flight – while at the same time – giving you a giant adrenaline rush from decimating mass amounts of baddies. And I can tell you after some 25 hours… it doesn’t go away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For gamers looking for depth and meaning behind their entrail splattering, Killing Floor 2 is not a prime choice. However, for players looking to spend some time in a silly, gory zombie shooter that doesn’t let storytelling get in the way of bloodshed, Killing Floor 2 is a good a throwback that’s welcome on the Xbox One.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While there is a single player mode for you to play should you lose your internet connection, or want to learn the maps, you essentially need to be connected at all times. There’s also no campaign of any sorts to speak of, so as long as you know that Killing Floor 2 is a multiplayer only focused shooter, you’ll know what you’re getting yourself into. The forceful key purchases only reinforce the view that many have of microtransactions, as there should have been some way to earn keys, even incredibly slowly, simply my playing. That being said, even though there are some faults to be found, and only two bosses included, I’m still enjoying my time within. Killing Floor 2 feels much more cooperative focused than other Horde-like games, contains a healthy amount of maps, and a large class selection that you’ll surely find a good fit for your playstyle. Faults aside, this isn't a that bad of a game at all, and worth a close look.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Volta mode offers a completely different game and gives us fun for many hours.,We can say without a doubt that we have the best and most complete FIFA of this generation.,,,"Taking everything into account, FIFA 20 on Xbox One has brought in more control to the experience; in particular the defending which feels refined. The Ultimate Team mode shines brighter than ever, whilst Pro Clubs receives the boost it needed, with many other areas still delivering solid modes without changing much. Sadly, there’s no longevity in VOLTA as it is, with a yawn-inducing story not helping matters.",,,"Volta brings new life into the series, but on the whole FIFA 20 is an adequate but underwhelming entry into the series.",FIFA 20 makes marginal improvements to an already successful formula in its core modes and offers something exciting in Volta.,"FIFA 20 offers an impressive number of modes and introduce the awaited Volta Football, but the gameplay is too tied to individual situations of attack and defense and loses a bit of fun.",,,,,,,"Delivering another strong outing, FIFA 20 proves once more that it's a football game truly to be reckoned with. There are issues, but few are serious enough to really mar the overall experience. Ultimately, FIFA 20 is fantastic, its new VOLTA Football mode being a particular joy, while FUT proves endlessly compelling yet again.","FIFA 20 floods the player with content and so many things to do, so many way to play. But there’s nothing really new, which means that even the flaws from the previous game are still here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For all the scathing comments about FUT's predatory and disgusting practices, it cannot be denied that FIFA 20 is still a great game. If micro-transactions are a concern then, avoid them - it is pretty easy to do with the sheer number of available options, which are next to none in this genre, with Volta and House Rules being incredibly fun additions to FIFA's on-going repertoire of modes. The subtle evolution of player skill moves might be inaccessible to the casual player, but the experts that can take advantage of these changes will definitely be able to test their skills. FIFA 20 is an evolution to the series, which has surprised with its diversity of options, and should only continue to grow as the decade goes on.",,,,"FIFA 20, as usual, takes another step forward to polish the series even further. The main addition this year is Volta, that brings street football back. It’s not a revolution, but it is a great football game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"FIFA 20 is quite similar to the previous version in its intentions. It's all about attack, dribbling and even if defense has been a bit tweaked, it's easy to see EA Sports wants to offer spectacular football before realism. Those who are okay with this vision will love it, and some additions like Volta, very pleasant, are, with a better Career mode and an always addictive FUT, will help to keep playing it for the whole year, until FIFA 21.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think it’s critical that publishers and studios offer more than just tweaks to gameplay and new lines of dialogue. EA Vancouver and Romania have done quite a bit in that effort this season. VOLTA is an adept component with surprising depth. Yes, it is ostensibly inspired by 2012 Street and borrows heavily from its bag of toe flicking tricks. But the iteration isn’t chintzy. It’s implementation isn’t some hasty, tacked-on remastering. The mode is fleshed out, thought out, and plays out effectively. It also seems to set an influential tone of fun across the 20 landscape. This is the most enjoyment I’ve had kicking it around on the FIFA pitch since 2015 and should be this addition’s memorable stroke.",,,,,,,,,,,"FIFA 20 certainly has a wide variety of changes to it, but much like MLS expansion team FC Cincinnati, these changes are in need of some more development time and polish - though the product on the pitch is still a real joy to watch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A superb game of football yet again, but some changes are better than others. FIFA 20 is still a great game fit to bursts with a mode for everyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"FIFA 20 feels like it might be a more divisive entry than usual. In altering the physics and game flow so dramatically, the team risks alienating just as many players as it hopes to bring in. That said, everything that makes FIFA what it is remains intact, with the usual attempts at streamlining and bug-wrangling. VOLTA is the big draw, with its community-driven structures and inclusive character creation. While plenty of fans will no doubt immediately jump to their favorite corners of FIFA, this year’s attempt at trying something new feels almost like its own game. EA Sports has been trying more and more lately to put a little something for everyone in each title, and FIFA 20 does exactly that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"FIFA has never been better, at least on the pitch. Volta is fun in small doses, but those looking to play something other than Ultimate Team will be inevitably disappointed in the lack of variation in offline modes. Those who are in it for the thrill of opening a pack and getting a star player, or who simply love collecting cards and playing football matches with their new additions will find a lot to love, at least until next season when it all begins again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best the series has been in a while.",,,,,"Thanks to the MUT and Franchise gamemodes, the game offers a great density and an immersive experience, with a solid technical aspect. Unfortunately, the story mode, this year, isn't better than the Longshot mode that we saw on last year's edition.",,"The new QB1 career mode--which includes a barebones NCAA football experience--overall feels like a half-baked idea that doesn't deliver anything meaningful or interesting. When it comes to the on-the-field action, however, the new X-Factor and Superstar abilities shake up the familiar gameplay formula to give seasoned players and newcomers alike a fresh way to scheme plays and orchestrate strategy on both sides of the ball.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I like aspects of Madden 20 like the addictiveness and slightly easier progression of Ultimate Team, the way players feel, and the new abilities. But too much remains stagnant and unchanged. It’s like expecting a few free agents to change the course of an entire organization when there are key areas the franchise needs to have addressed yesterday. Instead, its roster has gotten old fast and the problems are mounting.",,"There’s nothing inherently wrong but Madden NFL 20 was really missing the “X-Factor” that it needs to really breath some fresh life into the long, historic franchise. I’m sure I will still be playing Madden NFL 20 by the time I sit down to review Madden NFL 21, but in the back of my mind, all I’ll be hoping is that next year is the year they really revamp Franchise mode and take some bigger risks on the field. Until then, I’ll be taking my QB1 to his third straight Super Bowl.",,,,,"Madden 20 is back. As every summer, football fans have the opportunity to enjoy their favorite sport in a virtual way.

Between a less-oppressive Ultimate Team Mode, an excellent player career mode, and more exciting on-the-pitch plays it offers a whole lot of excellent content. Minor tweaks aside, Franchise mode could do with some love next year, but it isn't enough to dull these Friday Night Lights (sorry).",,,,"Madden 20 provides another year’s worth of well-crafted gridiron action. It’s a shame to say goodbye to Devin Wade and the Longshot narrative, but QB1 does a decent enough - if short - job of framing your own rise to fame. The rest of the package is as slick and smooth as you’d hope. Should you upgrade? If you’re an avid fan, you probably already have. For everyone else, both Madden 18 and 19 still play a fantastic game of football.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Madden faithful can purchase Madden NFL 20 with confidence as they do every year. On its own, it’s the best and only NFL experience in town but I would not blame you at all for skipping out this year. Madden NFL 20 remains only marginally better than Madden 19.","If EA wanted to do something revolutionary with the series, it would have offered Madden NFL 20 as a roster and feature update to Madden NFL 19. Not because there isn’t an enjoyable, playable game here, but because Madden NFL 20 is just more of the same when the series should be making strides toward true greatness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Madden NFL 20 is a stellar football sim, especially for those who enjoy Franchise or Ultimate Team. The reworked player ratings system adds authenticity to the on-the-field gameplay, and Ultimate Team is easier to follow than ever before. It’s not without its faults, though. The running game feels like a cheat code, and Face of the Franchise is a boring, poorly written career mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Whether it's the X-Factors, new Face of the Franchise mode, or even signature player animations, Madden NFL 20 feels more true to life than ever before.

grid,,,,,,"Is GRID the perfect racer? I have to say it comes close. It definitely checks off a lot of the boxes that I look for in a game. There may be a few features from other titles that I would have loved for Codemasters to have borrowed from but that’s a moot point. The car count is decent, the locales are gorgeously rendered, the audio is spot on, track layouts are interesting, and the racing at higher difficulty levels is incredibly intense. I would have liked to be able to set the length of the race in Career mode as I feel the races are a bit short but that’s probably the only gripe I have with this game. If video racing is your thing do yourself a favor and pick this up. Right now.",,,"Codemasters throws away the series' historical legacy delivering us a flat, soul-less and very casual oriented arcade racer.","Codemasters have build a direct arcade game based in velocity and action with GRID.

It can be forgiven for a career mode that on some fronts lacks variety, due to how well realised the gameplay is, as it's deep, authentic and above all else, a huge amount of fun.

The racing is exciting and keeps you on your toes, moreso than any other racer currently available. But there just aren’t enough modes to keep your attention in the long term.

It may not be a great novel, but it's certainly a very good one.",,"A deep and highly complex RPG, with a huge fantasy/sci-fi world and great freedom for the player.","If you are one of those players that enjoy with classic RPG, Torment: Tides of Numenera may offer you what you are looking for thanks to its huge complexity and a fascinating story line that makes this a game to be kept in mind. It’s a shame that its disastrous performance stains the final result.","Torment: Tides of Numenera proposes an adventure full of twists and with a great lore. Its turn-based system is the most interesting thing, and probably is the part of the game that makes it unique and different from other actual RPGs.","I absolutely adore the game, and I feel that modern roleplaying fans who also enjoy narrative-heavy games like Life is Strange will find a lot to love about Torment: Tides of Numenera. Modern RPGs from blockbuster-budget studios could learn a lot from InXile with regards to ""choice and consequence,"" and the true value of a branching narrative. If you're looking for a story-focused game where your choices truly matter, set in a rich, nuanced world absolutely crammed with sci-fi obscurities, fantastical beasts, and mind-warping trans-dimensional phenomena, you will adore Torment: Tides of Numenera.",,"There are many hours of gameplay to be had here and if you’re after an old fashioned, but fresh RPG, which takes its role playing roots seriously, then this is a must buy for you.

This is the rare game that leans almost entirely on its setting and writing for its appeal, and the miraculous thing is that it usually succeeds.",,,"There’s something rather alluring about Torment: Tides of Numenera. Whilst its central story is somewhat linear, it’s truly impressive just how personal your adventure can be thanks to the wealth of side quests that surround it and the multiple ways you can deal with each of them.",,,,,,,,,Torment is far more than just a phenomenal role-playing game.

The focus on dialogue and non-combative solutions is refreshing, especially since the combat can be too simplistic. The game offers many possibilities since there are multiple solutions to any quest. At the same time, the absence of a journal to record things is a disappointment, since the lore can be too deep, and mechanics like the Tides can be rather obtuse. For those looking for something offbeat in their RPGs, Tides is certainly worth checking out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite a few issues with the gameplay, loading times, and some random crashes, Torment Tides of Numenera provides one of the deepest and most entertaining RPG experiences you will find on the Xbox One.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It looks great, it plays well, and above all else, it comes packed with heaps of additional content. With some minor issues to the side, this is one hell of an arcade racing experience.","Despite showing its age in occasional places, the purity and simplicity of Burnout's arcade racing is as refreshing now as it was when the title was first released. Its world may not be as expansive or as good looking as some of today's titles, but its racing experience is still up there with the best and arguably superior to some modern-day counterparts.",,,"A lot of gamers remember with nostalgia the Burnout series and hope to get a new entry, but they must conform with a fully remastered Burnout Paradise. The good news is that the years seems to have not passed by for this game, that it's as fun and entertaining as it was on the first day.","With a successful artistic design coupled with the fun of its excellent arcade playability make it very appealing. However, to be great it lacks charisma, because graphically it doesn't impress outside of Xbox One X, and it doesn't bring enough new features.",,,"It’s fun, it’s wild, it’s a classic returning with a fresh lease on life and it’s one that any true racing fan should be getting involved with at the earliest opportunity.",,,,,,"There's nothing here that fans of the game won't have seen or played before, but it's still one of the best arcade racers around - and considering that it's now ten years old, it speaks volumes.",,"Burnout Paradise is as divisive as it has ever been, but now for other reasons as well. Still going back to this game brought back so many memories of playing with friends and the sense of speed is simply unmatched. I really enjoyed revisiting the world and think anyone who has fond memories will find more than enough here to warrant the price tag. Newcomers who never played the original are in for a treat though. There is nothing quite like Burnout Paradise and I hope the series makes a full return with a proper sequel in the near future.",,,,"Burnout Paradise Remastered represents a more than welcome comeback for a series that's been away for far too long. Given a lustrous new coat of paint, Burnout Paradise still looks the business then, but now it's got us yearning for a whole new Burnout.",,"Some will feel it’s asking a bit much to charge close to full price for this one. The core of the game is functionally identical to the Xbox 360 version, which is playable on Xbox One, and other similar games have been upgraded to 4K on that platform totally free. But taken on its own merits it's hard to argue against the amount and quality of the content. Paradise remains one of the most successful blends of action and driving ever, and the included add-on packs provide hours of tire-spinning, chassis-destroying fun.",,,,,,,,,"After all these years Bournout Paradise is still an amazing game with an exceptional sense of speed and some very clever design ideas.

While it does have some rough edges caused by time moving forward and work not being done to better-modernize it, the game is still a riot. It’s a must-own for anyone who likes fast racing action, and hopefully leads to more Burnout games getting re-released on modern platforms so more players can enjoy them.",,,,,,,,"Burnout Paradise Remastered is a lazy portage of his illustrious elder. If we are happy to have the most complete version here, we can only regret that there has not been some modifications to the ergonomics of the title. At this price we have the most beautiful and the most complete version of a game that has 10 years of age on its gameplay (which is excellent, as we already know).",,"Every aspect of the base game feels designed to work well with every other aspect. The cars are fast and most of them drift at the tap of your brake, and there are sweeping curves ready to accept those drifts. The shortcuts lead you some wild places, jumping and smashing your way ahead of the pack. By comparison, most driving games feel like a compromise between trying to design a real city for you to race real cars in while also trying to make an exciting video game. Burnout Paradise evokes reality but never at the expense of gameplay. That's something that other racing games could still stand to steal from this one.","Despite its lack of ""remastered"" features for this version, Burnout Paradise is a great game with plenty of content that can't hide its 10 years-story, but you can still have fun with it.",,,"Funny thing that to get the true Burnout experience after a dry season of 10 years we had to wait for the remaster of another Burnout title. Considering it is an HD version of a 2008 game, it's maybe a bit lazy in what it offers for the 30 dollar price tag, but ultimately a very fast-paced joyful arcade racing game that you'll find nowhere else.",,,,"Burnout Paradise Remastered isn't really worth grabbing if you already have the original. Hell, said original is even backward compatible on the Xbox One right now. Without any prior experience though I would absolutely give Paradise City a spin -- even with its faults, it's still one of the most memorable and mild open worlds in existence.",,,,,,"If you want a game that feels like the pad is an extension of your person, where every turn, every race feels like an out of body experience where one false move means glorious vehicular madness.

This games for you.",,,,,,,,,"The remastered ""open-world-arcade-driving-classic"" is as fun as the original version... but it seems that team behind this new version had been working with the foot off the pedal. Even with better textures, it's hard to not remember the achievements of the original (60 fps, great graphics...), making the remaster even more ""just fine"".",,,,,"Burnout Paradise Remastered is an amazing game, but the game is way too easy and too expensive. The fact that there’s no new content is also a pity.",,,,,Burnout Paradise Remastered is the perfect reminder of an arcade racer done right.

tacoma,A clever and absorbing interactive story set in an expertly built sci-fi world.,,,,"By the end of the game, I felt like I knew these crew members quite intimately which I’m guessing is part of the charm of Tacoma. Like us, these people are flawed individuals and given your involvement as an observer, it almost feels like a psychological experiment. On that note, Tacoma developer Fullbright should be commended on creating a very original game and given they were responsible for Gone Home, it’s great to see them using this premise and adding another layer of complexity with some very clever story telling.",,,"I may not entirely love where it winds up, but the journey getting to that point is so pitch-perfect, it'd be wrong of me to say it's anything other than a must-play experience for people who enjoy a good walking simulator.","A compelling three hours narrative experience, sustained by an interesting memories playback mechanic and a good sound design, but without excelling in any particular department.","Tacoma is a very interesting exploration game that will allow us to recompose a history. It is a failure in some technical aspects, however.",A piece of art that challenges conventional storytelling to build a socio political critique of our present from our close future. Essential and necessary.,,"Tacoma shines where it counts, and that is with the story it tells and the feeling that each character within it feels real. Including the on-board AI called Odin. As an interactive story, getting to pause, rewind, and check out the movements and activities of different people in a digital recreation of past events works flawlessly. And it’s the sort of mechanic that feels fresh, whilst also being something that could only really exist in this form. Lasting roughly two hours or so, Tacoma also never feels laboured or padded with extraneous content. But, as it also doesn't present a story focusing on one character as the lead there’s a feeling that something is missing. Which, robs the ending of some of its emotional weight.","Tacoma is a high quality walking sim that tells a brilliant story of hope, whilst delivering complex and interesting characters.",,,,,"Less personal than Gone Home but still an enjoyable experience. If a walking simulator is what you’re looking for, Tacoma is able to provide a few strong emotional moments searching for signs of the crew of the space station Tacoma, during their last days aboard. A lack of real empathy with the crew, however, is its weakest point, one that is difficult to forgive. The AR functionality is a very good addition, that we’d like to see in other similar games.",,"If you’ve played games like Gone Home, Dear Esther or Firewatch, Tacoma is instantly recognizable, but it remains distinct by introducing a wildly exotic space setting and a mechanic that keeps the “look and listen gameplay” from ever becoming a bore. It can, at times, devolve into too much of a linear experience, giving way to predictable pacing, but this is forgivable, because when your time is done on the Tacoma lunar station, your heart will be a little fuller for the people you met while you were there.",,,,,"Another smart entry into the interactive narrative adventure/walking sim genre, Tacoma is a sci-fi story that's engaging from beginning to end. To state the obvious, if you dig this kind of game, then you're going to love Tacoma too.",,"Though the game only takes a few hours to play through, the multiple layers of story — which each unlock additional meaning in the others once uncovered — make for a groundbreaking narrative system unlike anything else. But more impressive is the emotional impact of the stories themselves, not just the tale of a crisis aboard a space station and the perils of corporate-controlled AI, but the intertwining stories of six people's lives, loves and losses.","Mostly, though, I'm deeply attached to the Tacoma crew, who I only got to know through projections and the things they left behind. Out of everything, that's Tacoma's greatest accomplishment: getting you to care about people who aren't even there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tacoma excels at creating deeply relatable characters without the extravagance and big budget flashiness that pours from AAA titles, making other games feel almost unauthentic. Experiencing the crew’s highs and lows at your own pace instead of constantly being pushed along lets players relish in what makes Tacoma special; its ability to capture people’s emotions. It’s hard not to fall in love with Tacoma’s crew. Still, it’s difficult to overlook the lag as frequent as it is, so I hope Fullbright continues to patch the game. With a few fixes, Tacoma can stand out as an excellent title.",,,,Tacoma's augmented reality cast allow it to tell its engaging story in a unique way. It's a slow burn of a game that deftly interrogates interpersonal relationships in an engaging sci-fi setting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The cold, aseptic and recursive structure of the Tacoma space station is unfortunately reflected in this (almost) emotion-free title.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The game’s technical problems on Xbox One are a real shame, especially since the game is console exclusive to Xbox One, but those looking to look past these issues will be treated to an engrossing and surprising story aboard the Tacoma space station.",,,,,,,,,,A diverse narrative-driven space adventure for people wanting actual emotions and relationships in their games; that is Tacoma.,"Although Tacoma is short, it does a fantastic job telling the stories of the different characters throughout the game, using the non-sequential AR memory recordings to build emotional ties to each. Tacoma is a simple, yet fun narrative driven game that brings time and space together.","Tacoma is a great experience that’s not only wonderfully designed and produced, it’s one that that richly illustrates a side of videogames that’s worthy of further exploration.

halo-wars-2,"Simple, slick and satisfying, Halo Wars 2 is the undisputed chief of the console RTS. [April 2017, p.79]","Halo Wars 2 has once again proved that the RTS genre can work on consoles, and although you can never compare it with even mediocre RTS titles on PC, it still raises the bar on consoles. The single-player campaign is short and not deep enough, but the multi-player and blitz modes will certainly entertain; especially if you are a fan of Halo universe.","The most accessible yet demanding real time strategy game for consoles, Halo Wars 2 lives up to expectations while celebrating 20 years of RTS tradition at the same time. Fans of the franchise will love it, but veterans and newcomers to the RTS genre will be satisfied as well.",,"Halo Wars 2 fills the niche for a console-accessible real-time strategy game admirably. With a simultaneous Windows 10 release, PC gamers who loath console controls can also enjoy 343 Industries and Creative Assembly’s tactical take on Halo with keyboard and mouse, catering to both types of Microsoft’s RTS fanbase. With an interesting main narrative, fun competitive multiplayer modes and the general Halo spirit intact, Halo Wars 2 is an unexpected but very welcome sequel to Halo Wars worth a try for fans of the franchise and RTS games in general.",,"Creative Assembly has taken the groundwork set out by Ensemble’s Halo Wars and improved on some of the areas that were lacking in the original, all while still keeping the game accessible and easily playable using a controller. It feels as if the campaign has been released in an unfinished state, but it still offers a decent amount of action and a compelling story. The relatively low number of missions, the unsatisfying conclusion and the fact that 343 Industries and Creative Assembly have already announced that campaign DLC will be coming in the near future can't help but leave a bitter taste in the mouth. The new Blitz mode adds a different approach to the RTS combat to which we have become accustomed, and the shorter, more action-oriented, matches give newcomers and veterans alike something into which to sink their teeth.","I wholeheartedly urge you to check out Halo Wars 2, whether it’s with the release of the Ultimate Edition this week or the standard release next Tuesday. It’s packed with content on both the multiplayer and single-player side, all of which is fun to play. It also has a pretty fantastic story attached to it, incredible cutscenes, and an amazing soundtrack to boot. Ideally we won’t have to wait another 9 years for a Halo Wars 3.","Halo Wars 2 builds on the first game mechanics adding a new epic campaign with stunning cinematics and a compelling multiplayer, especially in the new Blitz mode. The somewhat underwhelming visuals ans some bugs bring it a little bit down, but lovers of Halo and RTS games will be fully satisfied.","Bigger, faster and... better. Halo Wars 2 is a great sequel. Visuals are great, the Xbox One's controller works fine and the sound is a masterpiece. However, the best part of the game is Blitz Firefight, a new card-mode which is really fun. If you enjoyed the first Halo Wars, this sequel is perfect for you.","Halo Wars 2 has an epic campaign, a complete multiplayer and amazing cinematic moments. Meet a new and fearsome enemy Atriox that endangers the entire galaxy and the UNSC must stop it by all means. It improves all aspects and adds new things like the addictive Blitz mode. Play alone or in company and enjoy one of the best experiences.","One thing is for certain, though. Between Multiplayer, Blitz Mode, and Halo Wars 2's stellar 2-player co-op campaign, there's truly something for everyone in this wonderfully polished package. This is the best RTS on Xbox One today, by far. And it's a stunning entry in the Halo pantheon.","Like with the original Halo Wars, what we have is an experience that can appeal to fans of both the Halo franchise and those who would enjoy your typical RTS experience. But, appealing to everyone can have its detriments, with some of the RTS elements in Halo Wars 2 feeling like they could have been fleshed out just a bit more, and some of the more action-oriented scenes feeling like they would have benefited from a perspective that wasn’t so far removed from the ground. But even so, it’s still an often-thrilling experience, and a great entry in the Halo franchise. And, a friendly reminder that there’s always room in the market for a good RTS game.","Halo Wars 2 irons out any issues that the original game had, and provides more of the same, but with a bit more polish. Whilst fans of the series will be glad to play this sequel, newcomers to the RTS scene might have a harder time.",,"Blitz mode aside, Halo Wars 2 sticks with a tried, tested and slightly tired RTS formula that's competent, but lacking in depth and originality.","Halo Wars 2 will scratch a real-time strategy itch and give you a dose of Halo-Universe flavor with a decent story, but it won’t go much deeper than that. A run-of-the-mill campaign, controls that hamper micromanagement, conspicuous bugs, and multiplayer that relies on luck limit its long-term appeal, but its fast and flashy action makes it fun for a while.","Halo Wars 2 is the best RTS you can play on consoles today. Whether you're a Halo lore junky looking to toy around with the campaign or a competitive RTS player looking for intense multiplayer matches, you can't do much better than this. Creative Assembly definitely stuck the landing with Halo Wars 2, pleasing fans of the original, bringing new players into the fold, and delivering a worthy successor to Ensemble's 2009 cult classic.",Quotation forthcoming.,"Halo Wars 2 is hands-down the best RTS available on console, and a game that rightfully deserves a place in any thinking Xbox One owner’s library.","Boasting high production value and the minor intrigue of what a new villain might mean for the greater series, Halo Wars 2 is fantastic for casual RTS gamers, but probably not for anyone else. Its relatively flat story, short campaign, and strategically shallow mechanics hold it back from greatness, instead relegating it to being yet another example of why RTS games don’t mix well with consoles.","Halo Wars 2 is a great sequel, and being a fan of both the genre and the original game, I am extremely happy with how it turned out. Sure there is a clear microtransaction-heavy mode thrust into the mix, but when it is this fun I don’t mind. Besides, I don’t get competitive enough to get hooked on buying the cards. Add in co-op and the ability to play against solid AI and the package feels complete. Those craving that real-time strategy feeling that has been almost non-existent on consoles for a long time are in for a treat with Halo Wars 2.","Halo Wars 2 is a fun and enjoyable real-time strategy game that showcases the biggest reasons we don’t see many RTS styled games on consoles. The lack of precise controls make for a clumsy and ineffective experience. The game’s spectacular sound design helps bring the world to life, and the Ark and the various units of each faction are well-designed and placed within the world. Halo Wars 2 isn’t the best RTS game out there, but as far as things go, it’s not a bad place to start, and could easily soak up your evenings if given the chance.",,,"The mechanics aren’t dumbed down - rather, they’re streamlined into something understandable and accessible without losing the depth that makes RTS games so damn satisfying to play.",,"Creative Assembly has deftly crafted an excellent RTS that sits somewhere between the worlds of consoles and PC, but it's clear that both worlds have to stretch a little to accommodate.","Halo Wars 2 carries forth enough of the series' beloved elements to make any fan of Halo feel right at home at first, but not in the long run. It’s palatable for those used to the FPS games, taking inspiration from favorite missions and putting a strategic spin on them; but just when things become more challenging and actually interesting, it runs out of steam.",,,"Halo Wars 2 doesn't break any new ground, and won't soon overtake the leaders of the genre, but it offers plenty for gamers who seek a refined console-focused RTS and another joyous trip into the Halo universe.",,"I couldn't tell you why, from a business perspective, Halo Wars 2 exists. It doesn’t seem like the kind of project that will yield blockbuster returns for anyone involved. It doesn’t move the RTS genre forward. But it does make for an accessible RTS that doesn’t feel stupid in the process, and it serves as a reminder of how well Halo’s world and fiction lends itself to spaces outside of the first person shooter, even if it can’t quite shake its franchise avoidance of meaningful denouement. [Provisional Score = 80]",,,,"Though the campaign might feel a bit short to RTS die-hards, it's a strong and enjoyable effort for the console audience. The clear paths to victory make it more manageable in short bursts too. The multiplayer offerings give Halo Wars 2 plenty of replayability, but Blitz mode needs more maps soon to make more of a lasting impression.",,,"The presentation of battles and especially cut scenes is extraordinary. Unfortunately the tactical options are rather shallow, while there is not enough content to satisfy in the long run.","This is a game that can sit proudly in the Halo canon and also call itself a true, albeit hybrid, RTS. It’s instinctive to play, exciting to watch and packs in some genuinely new ideas that deserve exploring. And if you still can’t get past the inevitable compromises and unfamiliar UI, there’s always the PC version.",,"At the end of the day, however, it’s the multiplayer and gameplay that make or break an RTS game, and Halo Wars 2 checks those boxes. If you’ve ever had the itch to command an army of UNSC soldiers, Halo Wars 2 will easily scratch it.",,"I enjoyed my time with the first Halo Wars, so I’m glad that Microsoft took a chance with a sequel. Unfortunately, aside from Blitz, I don’t feel like Creative Assembly pushed the envelope. Simplified base building, smaller maps, and outdated level design keep Halo Wars 2 for achieving great heights. However, if you loved the first Halo Wars, this entry delivers more of the same.","Easily the best real-time strategy on a console, and a fast-paced, accessible wargame that every Xbox owner should try and experience.","Halo Wars 2 is not without its flaws. It doesn't have the depth of other RTS's, but it does control surprisingly well and multiplayer options are abundant. There may not be much lasting appeal for hardcore players, but it is certainly fun in the moment, especially for console players that aren't too familiar with the genre.",,"This is a solid, Creative Assembly-driven RTS, well-suited for those who love the genre and also for those who are into science fiction; if you’re a fan of both, even better. Simple to understand, fun to play and challenging on higher difficulties, it’s hard to go wrong with Halo Wars 2.",,,Halo Wars 2 is an excellent game for Halo fns and for the fans of RTS games with little to no flaws.,"Don’t expect great new features compared to Halo Wars or some kind of strategic depth, but the Blitz mode and online multiplayer will entertain you in the long run.","This is one of the most interesting games on Xbox we've played this year, a great sequel and a game that both fans of Halo and/or strategy should try.",,,"Halo Wars 2 isn't afraid to mess with the standard RTS formula, and it's a better game because of it. Simply put, this is one of the best reasons to own an Xbox One.","While some challenges are simple and involve exploring every corner of the surprisingly large maps, others like keeping certain units alive are much harder. Only those who truly understand Halo Wars 2 will be able to accomplish this. Not only does this enhance replayability aside from the fantastic multiplayer offerings, it also gives you a reason to go back to the campaign.",,,,"Halo Wars 2 both illustrates the problems traditional RTS titles have on console, and demonstrates how to overcome them with its excellent Blitz mode.",,,,,,,,"Halo Wars 2 is a very accessible RTS that's easy to pick up and play, but becomes increasingly complex as you get to grips with its more advanced commands. Assuming you're willing to invest the time and effort to truly master its intricate controls, the game offers plenty to get your teeth into. The campaign is a little short, but the multiplayer components are varied and robust - even if the really entertaining Blitz mode is soured somewhat by its microtransactional focus.",,"A great, light RTS experience. If you like campaigns in this genre, you should check it out, but if you are looking for a hardcore competitive experience, you won't find it here. Blitz is OK, but the microtransactions system does not work well.",343 and Creative Assembly build the new chapter of the Halo Wars Saga on a stable basis and the multiplayer is enjoyable. However the short main campaign and the confined scope of the story don't let the game breath.,"Halo Wars 2 is an absolute masterstroke, taking console RTS limitations and somehow not only bypassing them, but making them unmissable features. This is one of the most well-made and cleverly designed games I have played in a long time. I hope it sets a precedent for other games to follow.","A really great job by 343 Industries and The Creative Assembly. Halo Wars 2 has a perfectly adapted control system for its proposal, a good technical work and a variety of game modes with hours of fun, including the Blitz mode, a new and original mode with lots of action and cards as focus.","Halo Wars 2 is a ballroom blitz with dangerously addictive levels of fun. It may be lacking in the length department when it comes to its tragically short campaign, but it’s a shining second chance example at proving that strategy games can work on console.",Quotation forthcoming.,,"If you're craving an RTS on a console, or perhaps aren't particularly well-versed in the genre, Halo Wars 2 has you covered. It doesn't offer much that other games in the same space have given us over the past 10 years, but it's polished and fun to play.","Halo Wars 2 does a fantastic job building on the foundation laid out by the original game. New modes and new characters highlight what is a fun return to the Halo universe, even if the campaign is shorter than I’d prefer.","Nothing revolutionary, but worthy of any strategy fan's attention, and a must for Halo devotees. [Apr 2017, p.72]","Those that fall into the thin sliver of hardcore Xbox and hardcore RTS fan on the video gaming Venn diagram, this should probably be your next purchase.","Halo Wars 2 is a better game thanks to the improvements of the ideas that were established by the first title. Better camera/cursor speed and the addition of custom groupings makes it feel closer to a PC RTS title while still maintaining the ease of control that console players want. The campaign and standard multiplayer modes are solid, while Blitz is a great addition for those looking for quicker RTS matches. While the game is undoubtedly better on a PC, the gameplay and presentation do well on a console — if you can overlook some of the issues mentioned earlier. Halo Wars 2 may be the only RTS game on the platform thus far, but it is a good one that's worth checking out.","Sacrificing a degree of nuance at the altar of spectacle is a trade-off most Halo fans will be happy to make. Yet, at times it feels like you're just smashing toys together and watching the carnage unfold. But what wonderful toys they are. [May 2017, p.114]",Halo Wars 2 offers fans of the franchise a whole new swathe of lore and is a damn fine real time strategy to boot - all playable from the comfort of your sofa.,"At its heart, HW2 is a console RTS that does what it needs to fit the broader appeal of the modern console generation. On PC its approach to game design will keep it off most GOTY lists, but on Xbox One its seamless gamepad control scheme and hefty selection modes make it a must for Halo devotees. Look past the shortcuts and you’ll find the best effort yet to light the real-time strategy fire on console.",,,"Halo Wars 2 is an excellent and long overdue return for the console RTS, doing everything that can be expected of a sequel. Bigger, better and fresher, the Blitz mode is a welcome addition to an already solid package, and while fans of the mainline Halo games may find the transition too hard to bear, this is a worthy addition to any Xbox One owner’s collection.","In terms of a console RTS, Halo Wars 2 stands just about at the top. It’s easy for newcomers of the genre to pick up and play, but still has a enough meat and complexity for veterans to be satisfied. Because of how the campaign wraps things up, I truly hope it gets a sequel. But until then, Halo Wars 2 is definitely a quality exclusive to add to your Xbox One lineup.",,"Halo Wars is a pretty good RTS which clearly targets the newbie player by offering plenty of modes that don't require to manage the economy. While the Halo side will appeal to the fans of the IP, the game is pretty much the only RTS available on consoles today. We doubt PC players will go for it as there are many better alternatives.","Technical issues and the lack of content in Blitz aside, Halo Wars 2 is a fun game that is the best bet for RTS fans looking for something to play on Xbox One. The campaign is engrossing from start to finish, the multiplayer matches are consistently exciting, and thanks to its status as an Xbox Play Anywhere game, Halo Wars 2 offers fans plenty of bang for the buck. If 343 and Creative Assembly are able to patch the game’s technical issues and add more areas to Blitz mode soon, then Halo Wars 2 will be a no-brainer for fans of the real-time strategy genre and the Halo franchise in general.","A solid effort in the RTS genre. It may not be revolutionary, but delivers in transmitting the epic battles of the main series.","There is, in other words, a lot more to this seemingly casual console RTS than meets the eye. Legions of Halo fans are likely to drive its initial popularity. They won’t have any trouble figuring out the basics and giving the Banished a good pounding. And a few months from now many of them may still be playing Blitz. But I won’t be surprised if Halo Wars 2 also develops a strong and faithful following of serious RTS fans who regularly wage epic multiplayer matches well into the wee hours.",,"Halo Wars 2 is a great example of how to make a great console RTS: the 343 Industries & Creative Assembly title is improved over its predecessor in terms of its interesting gameplay features, great calibration, good rhythm and Blitz as an excellent new mode. Unfortunately the campaign doesn't always look brilliant overall. However Halo Wars 2 stands as an absolutely recommended purchase for Halo lovers and has great appeal for RTS genre newcomers.","Halo Wars 2 might be a bit shallow compared to Starcraft 2, but as a strategy game on console it works really well. The controls are easy to understand, it’s action packed and the world is fantastic. For console players looking for a strategy game, Halo Wars 2 is an easy choice.","Halo Wars 2 is a decent sequel and one of the best RTS games on a console ever made. However, the story lacks any depth and the missions are easy and repetitive. Only buy Halo Wars 2 if you are an online player, otherwise you will be disappointed.",,,,"Even without playing the new 3 on 3 multiplayer, I feel I can easily recommend Halo Wars 2 to both Halo fans and those hankering for an RTS on console. The controls are tight, the cutscenes are to die for, and there is a new cute AI that I want to be best friends with. If you aren't sold on the whole RTS thing, or it just isn't a genre you're interested in, then at the very least watch these cutscenes somewhere online, because they are damn impressive.",Halo Wars 2 delivers a superb story that ends with a million possibilities on what could happen in future games.,,"Halo Wars 2 is not a perfect game, but is the best RTS on console and a great sequel!",,"I know I’ve mentioned Starcraft II a couple of times in this review, but it’s certainly the yardstick by which most RTS games are measured and this one is no different. There are obvious comparisons to be drawn between both games and Creative Assembly certainly wears its influences proudly, but Halo Wars 2 never strays into clone territory. It stands well on its own, creating an experience that combines cinematic storytelling with varied and interesting strategic gameplay, as well as throwing in a few explosions for which Halo is often known. And best of all, it manages to be accessible enough that even a blunt object like myself can finish the campaign.","Halo Wars 2 retains itself as serviceable fun, if only by being unbearably approachable, and enjoyably Halo.",,,"Even though there are two new companies in charge of Halo Wars 2, this strategy game is an excellent sequel without any big revolutions. It might be a bit dull that way, but fans of the series will still enjoy this a lot.","Halo Wars 2's campaign is an exciting enough ride with a very plain final drop. Thankfully, there will be plenty of multiplayer modes to run with what the campaign teaches. Try it.",,,,,,"Halo Wars 2 suffers a little from its console limitations, but it’s a solid RTS with a strong campaign and a good overall feel for the Halo universe. After a slow start the mission design grows much more interesting and while there’s little here you won’t have seen in a StarCraft, it’s all handled with variety, pace and drama. There’s potential too in the multiplayer modes, particularly Blitz with its unique hybrid style. It might not be the Halo sequel that you asked for, but it’s a fine one to be getting on with.","Blitz mode may not be for everyone, but it’s a game changer for the genre regardless if you agree with its addition or not, at least they’re offering a different experience, something that inexperienced RTS players, like myself, have always wanted to enjoy, but wasn’t able to for whatever reason.","Halo Wars 2 isn’t trying to redefine real-time strategy games, but rather give fans of the genre an option on their Xbox One consoles. It’s leaning on Microsoft’s most cherished franchise and using it well.",,,It's quite an entertaining game as it comes with vast yet satisfying content. We highly recommend it for strategy fans.,,,,Halo Wars 2 is an ambitious game that delivers easily understandable RTS gameplay in an immersive way. Genre enthusiasts may be disappointed but there's no denying the amount of fun to be had strategically taking on Atriox forces.,,,"Halo Wars 2 is still a highly recommendable title — in fact, likely one of the best RTS games that can be found on the current generation. However, accessibility on consoles came with a price to both controls and gameplay in both campaign and multiplayer modes.",,,,"Halo Wars didn't rewrite the RTS playbook, and Halo Wars 2 is unlikely to bring on many converts who weren't convinced by the first attempt. In many ways this is an iterative sequel, with new units and balance, and a handful of additions. The campaign is well-made and the multiplayer shines thanks largely to Blitz Mode. It's a streamlined take on a genre that has faded even more in recent years, but in its own way, Halo Wars 2 is still carrying the flame.",,,,,,,,"Halo Wars 2 is a very pleasant, fast and dynamic RTS that does everything very well. What's really important it the fact that 343 Industries' game works great as a console RTS. It's less complicated than its PC counterparts but represents the genre with pride and has no competition on Xbox One.",,"Halo Wars 2 brings back the RTS genre for the console players. Featuring a very direct and not complex action, this game is accessible for everybody who wants to try this kind of game.","The campaign tells a safe narrative that is made more impressive by the intimacy of the gameplay. The multiplayer Blitz mode may not be for everyone, but between it, and the rest of the multiplayer, there's enough there to keep people going for quite some time.","Halo Wars 2 embodies some of the best aspects of real time strategy while redefining it through its new Blitz mode. That being said, it would have been nice if the campaign would have offered more variety, as opposed to sticking to a safe and well-tested format a little too closely.","I am, however, a Halo devotee going back to the Combat Evolved era, and can say with certainty that this is an accessible and worthy installment in that enduring saga. After a couple dozen hours spent playing, I'm already eager to revisit the campaign on a higher difficulty – and Blitz remains sheer, unabashed fun. Even 15 years later, Halo's still got tricks up its sleeve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Halo Wars 2 does an incredible job of ensuring console players can enjoy the RTS genre and there's certainly a lot of content here, but it's difficult to get really excited about any of it. The campaign doesn't push any boundaries and the game's most exciting multiplayer mode, Blitz, is hampered by the feeling that players who spend more money are given an unfair advantage over their opponents. It's exciting to see another high-profile RTS game released, but this one doesn't do quite enough to move things forward.","If you want to play a Halo game with the simpler story, backs-to-the-wall tone and cinematic flair of Bungie’s good ol’ days go right ahead and play Halo Wars 2. Just don’t expect the quality of the game to match that of the cutscenes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"RTS developers often talk about silhouettes — the unique visual profile of a unit or building — being important. Good silhouettes allow players to identify and assess the threat of an incoming force in just a few seconds, but the examples in Halo Wars 2 are difficult to read at that kind of pace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It doesn’t out-Diablo Diablo, but thanks to the care put into the levelling and loot systems, it is undoubtedly worth the time to explore.",,,,,,,,"Getting the $39.99 Overkill Edition will give you the base game and both DLCs. They’re both worth it, so that would be the best bet for people wanting to get the most out of Victor Vran. As far as the game goes, it is just as competent as the heavy hitters in the dungeon crawling genre. The online works well, and with four player co-op, it can be a blast to play with friends. I highly suggest Victor Vran to any action RPG fan.",,,,"Victor Vran: Overkill Edition is a robust, enjoyable dungeon crawler with satisfying combat mechanics, marred only by a single, albeit quite major bug on Xbox One. This issue aside, Victor Vran is genuinely excellent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I am always appreciative if designers approach a genre from a different angle. And this is exactly what Heamimont did with hack&slay.

There's nothing majorly wrong with it, but the Motorhead add-on shows us glimpses of personality that the main game lacks and the limited customization holds it back from being anything more than average. One of the main draws for these types of games is the loot, but when most of the loot is same or didn't change much, there's not a lot of reason to keep going. Whilst the fighting itself is satisfying, and the co-op (both online and offline) modes kept the game interesting socially, the longevity just isn't there. Unlike The Witcher 3, which I've still to finish. Thanks for the constant reminder Victor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Victor Vran is full to the brim with ARPG content. While its narrative is light and its gameplay is limited, the well-designed levels and high replayability make this a worthwhile purchase for fans of the genre, and those who are just looking for a fun time with friends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A fun but ultimately shallow experience, Victor Vran offers a dungeon crawler experience that is solid, but not particularly interesting.",,,,,,,,,"Overall, Victor Vran: Overkill Edition is a solid ARPG that will easily please fans. The action is non-stop, the level design is well done, and the whole endeavor is as fun as it looks. While the base game is easy to recommend, going for the Overkill Edition can be a little tougher. The Motörhead DLC is worth it, but the Fractured Worlds DLC is only good if you plan for this to be your main ARPG for a long time. No matter which version you choose, Victor Vran is well worth checking out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For dungeon crawling, action RPG games that offer immense depth, 4-player multiplayer, and a high replay factor that isn't found on many multiplayer games, for the price of $19.99 is hands down the best value for dollar game you can find on the console right now.

world-to-the-west,,,,,,,"World To The West is a 'Sunday stroll' type of game. It's pleasant and enjoyable without being too taxing or stressful for the player. It's all well presented with a fun soundtrack playing in the background and the puzzle elements are challenging without becoming overly complex. In short, this is a well presented and a well crafted little puzzle-adventure if you can accept the necessary back-tracking as part of the overall puzzle. It may well be a little too straightforward for hardcore fans of the genre, but for most it will be an entertaining little diversion.",,"A nice Zelda-like, recalling elements of A Link Between Worlds in a colorful adventure. Its weaknesses reside in the excessive backtracking and too repetitive and unimaginative puzzles, but it's still a good buy for lovers of the genre.",World to the West is a game with very original mechanics that proposes a challenge to our mind in a precious world.,World to the West will catch us with very interesting proposals within the universe of Teslagrad.

The price might be a tad high, but there’s a lot of quality clearly on show here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While somewhat in the same vein as the top down Zelda entries, World to the West doesn't come close to being nearly as good. The interesting use of characters and overall well-done puzzles are hurt by annoying backtracking, a lacking story, and a few smaller issues, that all hold the game back from being a much more fun experience. Even with that said, it still is a solid experience with good elements that some people will get a fair amount of enjoyment out of.",,,"World to the West is presented in stylized and clearly-defined visuals which goes a long way in perceiving the environmental puzzles. The same simple approach extends to the gameplay. Everything is straightforward and easy to grasp. I liked the old-school vibes of World to the West, harking back all the way to the 80's. When I played these kind of games as a kid with home computers, they were called arcade adventures and presented usually in an isometric view. At the same time, elsewhere in the world kids had their Nintendo Entertainment Systems and were immersed with the likes of The Legend of the Zelda. In my eyes World to the West manages to blend the best of both the western and eastern schools of action-adventuring.

olija,,,,,,"Olija oozes originality, from its cinematic storytelling to its uniquely retro graphics and the genre-bending award-worthy soundtrack that ties it all together. And don’t forget about its fluid combat and exploration-focused gameplay that slowly introduces new mechanics that keep the game engaging and fun but at the same never letting it get too complex. For a while I put off engaging in what I believed to be the final encounter because I truly enjoyed my time in the game world and wanted it to continue. While watching the final cut scene I was not so secretly hoping my character would get dragged back into the land of Terraphage.

But as a bite-sized 2D action adventure, it leaves a very strong impression thanks to a magical harpoon that makes fighting, moving, and discovering secrets especially rewarding. Its combat in particular packs a surprising amount of depth and flexibility, even if its enemies and bosses never really stepped up and demanded that I engage with that depth to defeat them. Much like Faraday himself, I don’t see myself ever returning to Olija’s mysterious world, but it’s an adventure I won’t soon forget.",,,,,,,,,,"Its staging has steadily transported us, while its cleverly designed boss fights have us fully engaged.

Succinct and satisfying is a rare combination, and it makes Olija a rare treat.",,,"Olija is a unique platforming experience that will captivate from start to finish.

mafia-definitive-edition,,,,,,"Mafia: Definitive Edition is how a remake should be done. By taking and meticulously remoulding the original game, Mafia: Definitive Edition sings with a deliciously authentic 1930’s gangster shooter experience that’s enriched to no end by a chapter-based story that keeps the focus on the story and its characters. The aiming and target reticule aren’t ideal, and the Free Ride mode is a missed opportunity, but when the smoke clears and all you want is a classy hard-boiled gangster shooter there are few better options available.",,,"Mafia: Definitive Edition is a two-sided coin. On one side we find stunning graphics and a great plot that still manages to captivate us after 18 years, while on the other side we find some meaningful shortcomings that could have been avoided re-designing some aspects of the original game. Despite this, it's still a suggested buy both for people who loved the original game and for the ones that never played it.","Mafia: Definitive Edition is a spectacular remake that brings us one of the games with the best graphics of this generation. Its exciting plot and great atmosphere take us back to the 1930s, where a cab driver gets into a war between mafias that will change his life.","Mafia: Definitive Edition is a clear example of a well done remake, which adds new features and a magnificent technical section. All this maintaining the essence of the original title.","Powerful characters, nuanced story-telling, and stunning visuals make Mafia: Definitive Edition one of the best story-driven games of the year.",,"I will admit that I was wary of 2K choosing Mafia to remaster, as the game was old and middle of the pack, but in hindsight it was a masterstroke: the story and structural core of the original was exceptional, but everything else had room to improve. 2K has thrown the sink at Mafia: Definitive Edition to make sure those improvements make an impact, and it’s barely possible to recognise the original under the lacquer.",,,"Oozing with 1930s atmosphere, Mafia: Definitive Edition is a successful rejuvenation of the best story in the series.","As the title infers, Mafia: Definitive Edition is indeed the definitive version of the classic game, this time with completely redone visuals and updated gameplay that makes the game feel like it could have released today as a brand new game and few would have known the difference.",,"Even with its faults, Mafia: Definitive Edition is a fantastic remake of the original game. Its story is as engrossing as ever, tempting you to play just one more chapter before hitting that quit button. And while the gameplay isn’t perfect, it’s solid enough to keep you entertained. However, it’s a shame that more hasn’t been made of the game’s open world, as so much care has obviously been put into making it. Still if you’re after a story-driven single-player game to sink a decent amount of time into, you can’t go wrong with Mafia: Definitive Edition, especially considering its somewhat budget price. It’s simply an offer you can’t refuse.",,,,,,"A more than welcome return for a seminal crime classic, Mafia: Definitive Edition has all of the attributes you could possibly want from a great remake – fresh visuals, overhauled gameplay, and a reverence for its source material.","Mafia has finally regained its splendor and this remake will be a very good entry point for anyone who wants to discover a game that marked its time, with a little indulgence, while fans will appreciate this facelift that never betrays the essence of the original experience, while modernizing it despite its sometimes aging aspects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This Definitive Edition might have been wiser to double down on the original, slightly hokey script and performances, rather than strive for something more sophisticated in the rewrite.",,,,,,,,"Mafia Definitive Edition is an excellent return to a genre largely forgotten this generation. It has some technical foibles, but still delivers a compelling narrative with strong characters, diverse missions and a sturdy linear structure bolstered by a backseat open world.",,,"Despite the lack of innovation or novelties that would have added something to the experience while respecting the structure of the original, returning to Lost Heaven with this quality has been an offer that we could not refuse and neither should you.",,"Mafia returns with an incredible remake, and while the visuals are fantastic, some gameplay aspects haven’t aged very well. Still, an enjoyable game with a story very well told.",,,"Telegraphed game design turns Mafia: Definitive Edition, once a subversive classic, into just another by-the-numbers cover shooter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mafia: Definitive Edition is the best of both worlds.

Although it doesn't quite have the narrative cohesion of Mafia II, it still offers a memorable and gripping story that's set in a gorgeous virtual adaptation of 1930s America.",,,,,,,,,"The Mafia franchise again presents one of the medium's best-written stories, though the series still stumbles on building something special around that story.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mafia: Definitive Edition is the perfect game for those who loved the original work of Illusion Softworks back in 2002. A travel back to Lost Heaven that should be mandatory to meet Tommy, Paulie, Don Salieri and many others from a current and much fresher perspective.

The graphics element is just spectacular.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A solid remake, that simultaneously stays true to the original game, but also gives it a fresh coat of paint.

The script doesn't quite work all the time and the physics might annoy some, but if you’re looking for a test of the mind, this is certainly worth looking at.",,,,,,"If you’ve got the patience for it, Relicta is undoubtedly a neat puzzle game. It’s quite lengthy for a game of its type, which is perhaps why it eventually begins to feel overly repetitive, but you are spurred on when you encounter an a-ha! moment and go on to solve a puzzle that’s been perplexing you for the last 15 minutes or so.

Its narrative may be somewhat small in scope, but the subject matter it deals with packs a punch much greater than any tall tale of time manipulation ever could. Its characters are some of the most well-realised I’ve come across in a game yet, and their story is one that’s not going to leave me any time soon. Dontnod deals with difficult subject matter bravely and commendably, but that’s not why Tell Me Why is so special. It’s the combination of everything altogether – its characters, actors, visuals, story – that makes this an experience I’m not soon going to forget.",,,,,,,"Dontnod announced to us with Tell Me Why a realistic production devoid of minimalist stereotypes. Promise kept. For almost eight hours, it tells a harsh story, strong in its words, its authentic characters, and its thoughtful dialogues. These are the main strengths of the game. But the player's involvement is too little in this title, which nevertheless outlined attractive possibilities, often under-exploited. His participation will be limited mainly to emotional choices, often giving the impression of being passive in the face of the action. We will remember a benevolent story, whose rhythm and lack of freedom sometimes push us to drop out.",,"Mary-Ann reminds me a lot of Twin Peaks' Laura Palmer, a girl known primarily as a victim. It's only until the movie Fire Walk With Me that we know just how much was going on behind the eyes of that idyllic photograph we saw of her every episode. In Tell Me Why, our clearest, enduring image of Mary-Ann Ronan is the dead woman whose childrens' lives were destroyed after her death. Finding out everything beautiful, intelligent, and loving that was going on behind those eyes is the most powerful thing in Tell Me Why, and matched in how her life created two strong, empathetic children who knew her well and didn't even realize it. There's a lot of empty disengaging space to be filled in in this game, but with a little patience and sympathy, what it does provide you is worth the effort.",,,,,,,"Tell Me Why is a thought-provoking narrative adventure that will stick long in the memory, and for the right reasons. It delivers an imaginative and emotional tale that isn't afraid to address mature topics along the way, and does a commendable job of making you care about its characters and remain invested in its conclusion. It won't suit everyone due to its slow pace and lack of action-packed gameplay, but it nevertheless tells a worthwhile story that deserves to be experienced, and we're grateful to have gone along for the ride.",,,,,"Tell Me Why brings you an intense story of a traumatic childhood, but the boring gameplay elements as well as the superficial emotional connection of the protagonists rather are a disappointment.",,,,,"Tell Me Why doesn’t exactly answer the question it poses in its title, and maybe that’s the point. Even so, I came away with mixed feelings by the end. I really enjoyed getting to know Tyler and Alyson, and I felt the suspense and intrigue of figuring out this larger mystery, but it also disappointed me. This was only further illustrated in the ending choice, which is just absolutely awful in terms of how it’s presented and how the characters rationalize it in the scenes that follow. It doesn’t end on a strong note, and what’s in between is full of highs and lows. The highs make it worth playing, but just expect to be shaking your head when those low points hit.","Dontnod continues to lead the world in terms of character diversity and representation, and while Tell Me Why’s story can sometimes lack drama it’s still engagingly interactive.",Tell Me Why might lack the excitement of time travel or superhuman abilities but its subdued tone works in its favor as a tightly paced and progressive character drama.,"Tell Me Why is a Dontnod game throughout its every part, right down to its bones. Although those bones might be bare, it has a lot of soul. With care, Dontnod dive into discomfort and drag us with them throughout three concise episodes that explore the power that comes coupled with familial ties, both bound by blood and by the metaphysical, as well as memory and all of its heartbreaking deceptions.","That’s the real beauty here: stories don’t have to be full of doom, gloom, betrayal and murder to be effective or impactful. Queers don’t have to be dragged through the mud because of who they are. While Tell Me Why may draw people in because of a transgender character, it offers far more than just that. It presents a complex, psychological narrative that doesn’t use minorities as mere tools to shortcut emotional responses from its players. Take note.",,,,,"Dontnod successfully brings back its narrative, dealing masterfully with complex topics and absorbing the player in its world.","By cleverly leaning on the conventions of YA fiction — supernatural elements, family conflicts and the like — the studio has hit emotional peaks rarely, if ever, seen before in gaming (both the first and the second Life is Strange games left me misty-eyed).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tell Me Why tells a compelling story with some of the most memorable characters in videogames of recent years, but the narrative sometimes feels rushed and some of its best moments feel a little bit too short.",,,,,,,,"Tell Me Why might be smaller in scope and less mechanically complex than Dontnod’s Life is Strange series, but it’s just as emotionally impactful. It’s a compelling story with relatable, complex characters, and yet another example of Dontnod’s unbeaten ability to make players feel something, anything, in a medium that’s increasingly more mind-numbing.",,,"Tell Me Why is a memorable experience that's done well. The adventure portions are a good reminder to adventure game fans that the classic experience of logical puzzle-solving is alive and well, but the narrative becomes the driving force for completing the title. From the natural reactions to the characters to the assurances that the subjects of culture and transgenderism aren't just there for show, everything is elevated to the level of some of the best television dramas. For those who want something that's still considered new in the gaming landscape, Tell Me Why is a title that's well worth checking out.",,,,,,,"Tell Me Why is one of those games you're best experiencing for yourself. The narrative's engaging and mysterious, its characters are well-written and likable, and the varied gameplay keeps things fresh to help you push through to the end.",,"Tell me Why is clearly the heir of Life Is Strange, but it will only appeal to those who don't mind to hear the same story. Both games are extremely similar, and it feels like DontNod is getting low on inspiration. If you don't mind that deja vu feel, you'll enjoy a nice storyline and a very nice artistic touch.","Tell Me Why doesn't allow players to skip most of the dialogue in the game, meaning those going back through for collectibles or to see how different choices impact the story will experience a lot of deja vu. This inability to skip dialogue significantly brings down Tell Me Why's replay value, unfortunately.",,"This is exactly the sort of game we, as a society, need right now: authentic, inclusive, edifying, engaging, and, in the end, hopeful. Tell Me Why is one of the best and most memorable games of the year, and it helps lay a foundation for the growth of minority presence in games with wider audiences.",,"Tell Me Why lacks the emotion of Life is Strange and feels a little restraint in its three-episode structure, however it's a well written story-based game, with a complex and mature plot, and the ability to tell a tale about how extraordinary everyday life is.",,,,,,"Tell Me Why’s exploration of the complexities of memory, the difficulties of knowing our loved ones, and a world that can be better for our transgender loved ones make it a game worth experiencing.","You could say that Tell Me Why is about the journey and not the destination, and that journey is indeed a compelling one. And it’s complex; with violence, dysfunction and mental illness featuring prominently, it’s a dark tale in many ways. But it is also one full of hope as well – in the unlikely love that can bring two outsiders together, in the mental bond that literally connects two siblings, and in the liberating power of the truth. You’ll come away from playing Tell Me Why feeling a lot of things – sadness, optimism, confusion, disappointment. I can’t tell you which of these you’ll feel when you play it … but you should play it.",,,,"Tell Me Why deals with some sensitive subjects with respect and sensitivity, making the story both gripping and powerful in ways they've never done before.",,,"Tell Me Why keeps you invested and interested story-wise for the full nine hours, but is lacking in the gameplay department. It's clear that this genre in its current state is standing on its last legs.",,,,,,,,"Tell Me Why is an engrossing narrative adventure that pushes inclusivity to the forefront, setting a new benchmark for queer representation in the blockbuster space. As a transgender person, this is the level of research and respect that I anticipate from games going forward, and knowing it has the backing of Xbox Game Studios gives me that hope.","It’s abundantly obviously that Tell Me Why was made as a labor of love, and my time with Tyler and Alyson, while short, was very memorable. More importantly, it made me learn something new, ask questions and broadened my knowledge to other people’s plights that I’ve never had to personally experience. Not many other games have had the same lasting impact that Tell Me Why has.",,,,,,,,Tell Me Why tells an engaging story of twins unraveling a mystery and forming a bond after being separated for most of their childhood. It's a more mature narrative set in a cozy Alaskan backdrop that could draw the attention of gamers who are interested in story-driven experiences yet may have been put off by all of the teen drama featured in previous Dontnod titles.,,,,,,,"Tell Me Why stands out as one of Dontnod Entertainment's best efforts to date, which is high praise given their output to this point. It's a brilliant story about twins coming to terms with childhood trauma while exploring the mysteries of how they came to be where they are. The characters are memorable and the dialogue is some of the best to come out of a Dontnod game yet. And at three chapters that average roughly two hours each, the game doesn't overstay its welcome. Dontnod knows just what it wants to say and it says it beautifully.",,,,,,,,,,,,A honorable attempt to breach multiple difficult and complex issues.,,,,,,,"A lot of families hide pasts that, well, those living in the present day would rather not talk about. The Ronan twins' past is one touched by darkness, by actions and individuals who they have, understandably, pushed to one side. Going through this journey of rediscovery with them is a sometimes shocking but often joyous experience, and if you're someone who loves a tender yet twisted narrative adventure, Tell Me Why absolutely deserves your attention.","Those who enjoyed Life is Strange will find quite a lot to love in Tell Me Why . It’s strange that this game isn’t a third entry into the series when it very well does feel like one. After several releases with very similar gameplay structure, you’d think there’d be some more improvements in regards to the slowness of picking of objects and cycling through dialogue. However, as you’d come to expect, the characters are great and the overall story is intriguing enough to keep going. Tell Me Why is another interesting and captivating episodic adventure, albeit a familiar one, from one of the studios that does it the best.","Tell Me Why’s focus on authenticity in storytelling makes it an absolute narrative triumph. The perfect pace allows you to reflect on each element of the story as it unfolds, and clever use of gameplay mechanics makes each choice feel impactful yet organic. A must play for fans of the genre.",,,,,,"Dontnod has crafted a brilliant narrative that once again puts teenagers and young adults at the forefront of today's big issues, never shying away from talking about our world. But this isn't just an ""issues"" game. It reminded me of the TV series Rectify, about a convict released from prison thanks to DNA evidence proving his innocence. There is similar poignancy and sadness throughout the story in Tell Me Why, as Tyler and Alyson discover the meaning of their childhood memories, while being unable to change the past, trying to reach a mother now lost to the world. Not only does it provide emotional depth, but the story seeks emotional justice, and it never fails to bring us along on this journey for the truth. [Eurogamer Recommended]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"When all is said and done, though Tell Me Why doesn’t necessarily disturb the established Dontnod template too much, it executes it well enough that that doesn't ever seem like an issue. Excellent characters, strong writing, and a deeply personal plot help the player connect with the story. In the end, that most criticisms of the game can be boiled down to “I wish I had had more time to spend in its world and with its characters” should, ultimately, be all that really needs to be said about Tell Me Why.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If this does sound like something for you though, then Freedom Finger will offer a few hours of a lot of fun.",,,,,,,,"The biggest problem Freedom Finger runs into is its lack of variety. The story and humor carry it for a while, but by the ends I grew tired of its monotony. I wish there was just a little more to it. The game looks cool, sounds great, and plays wonderfully, and it looks and runs good to boot. I just felt like it gave little reason to keep coming back for more.

On the one hand it succeeds in its intent, thanks especially to the proposed puzzles and the remarkable longevity. However, much of the experience is still tied to a limited script and the freedom of movement within the house is only apparent. The obsessive bactracking and the very slow pace of the action end up limiting the ambitions of the game, which remains - in any case - a raw and terrifying experience. Visage represents a considerable step forward compared to the usual horror rides proposed by the competition, but not enough to approach the classics it is inspired by.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A terrifying and unnerving experience to play, Visage pays tribute to those that came before it spectacularly.

Whilst most of the game’s fun quests and opportunities have meaning and depth, a large portion of them feel needless and tacked on, merely to bolster longevity. Still, overall, it’s hard not to be allured by the game’s diverse and truly relaxing foundation.","Yonder is the type of game I wish we had a lot more of on Xbox. Its quaint and relaxed nature is a breath of fresh air and an easy recommendation for families playing together. While its more structured story leaves less post-game life to live compared to its genre counterparts, it also manages to find a comfy middle ground between simplicity and depth. It's approachable, adorable, and sows the seeds of happiness in its characters and players alike.",,"Yonder features a nice and colorful open world, with good crafting and exploration mechanics.

[June 2017, p.84]",,,,,,"With a short completion, excellent main characters, and good production values, the highs reach far higher than the lows. It’s an altogether lovely experience, especially if you have siblings to relate to, and it stands clearly among the better adventure games available on Xbox One. The only issue is its cost. This is a game that would firmly benefit from a sale, so I suggest you keep your eyes out because you won’t want to miss this memorable experience.",,"An emotional and magical adventure, with great visuals and charmingly believable characters. We'd wanted it to endure longer and sometimes would have liked to run instead of slowly walking, but really loved the overall experience.","Blackwood Crossing brings us a memorable and moving experience. Its script, characters and themes will catch us from the very beginning. The game has serious issues on both gameplay and technical aspects, but the quality of its story tips the scales in its favor.",,"The narrative genre often takes a closer look at human emotions, something we don't often see in other genres. Blackwood Crossing takes a bold leap into examining emotions and family dynamics, tackling subjects such as love and grief, separation and moving on. It's a topic that lends itself well to the genre, as the minimalistic gameplay places a magnifying glass over the narrative the game competently weaves.",,"I highly recommend playing Blackwood Crossing. Look, you will know whether this is the kind of game you might like by looking at the trailer or screenshots, but it’s game about character, story and atmosphere, rather then high action. Even through it’s a tad short and the price is north of the £10 mark, it’s a beautiful, life affirming gaming experience that I won’t forget for a long time.",,,,,,"[Blackwood Crossing is] not perfect, but the amount of love that pours out of the game – both in terms of the visual and technical quality from the team of developers and in the palpable relationship between the characters – far outweighs any minor nitpicks you could have.",,,,,,"Blackwood Crossing might be short but sweet, yet it's clearly an experience that's been made as a labour of love, and as such, it has a magical, almost ethereal quality that's impossible to forget.",,,,,,,,"The truth Blackwood Crossing finds is unforgettable and emotionally wrenching. Its palette of feelings - love, loss, anger, belonging - are beyond the scope of all but the best narrative games, and Blackwood Crossing is one of the most beautiful and best I have ever played. It explores the meaning of childhood, without falling into a soup of schmaltz. It dares to investigate the mutual incomprehensibility of adulthood and childhood, and to explore the different landscapes we and our offspring inhabit.",,,,,,,,,,"Blackwood Crossing begins with the promise of a fantastic and emotional journey, and provides one from beginning to end when it comes to a terrific story, but in terms of gameplay, the journey ends well before we can even take a stroll to the dining car or the like. It’s just too short a trip, not allowing for enough time to make the most out of things when it comes to puzzles, challenge or unique interactions. It’s decent, sure, but sadly never gets the opportunity to be truly interesting, which is sad given the amount of potential here.","Blackwood Crossing offers a touching glimpse into the inner workings of a family from the perspective of a young teenage girl. Loss is at the core of the story and watching Scarlett and Finn internalize loss is a heartbreaking look at childhood. Revealing too much of the story takes away from the magic of Blackwood Crossing, but it is a gripping tale that everyone can connect to. Some of the puzzles boil down to disappointing distractions, but other are always engaging which makes the beautiful story the most important aspect of the game. Anyone looking for next tremendous story in gaming should look no further than Blackwood Crossing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blackwood Crossing is a great game and if you can look past the clunky controls and odd frame pacing issues, it’s a blast to play. However, the majority of gamers will be aggravated by the problems with the controls. The developers need to address these issues soon because it’s a treat to play on PC but not on Xbox One.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Blackwood Crossing is a game I highly recommend experiencing. It’s a game that defies explanation but has deeply emotional implications. If you’re as fascinated as I am by the emerging trend of games that portray real feels then Blackwood Crossing is a no-brainer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Needless to say, Blackwood Crossing is a gem, though a couple of slight problems cloud its shine just a bit. This truly is an impressive, memorable and spectacularly human game that does a better job than most of conveying real human emotions through interactive experiences.

It’s an old-fashioned platformer with some very neat tricks and a lot of highly enjoyable gameplay. It might be a bit too samey for some regarding pace and style, but the story is charming with a very downbeat ending, that nearly ruins your investment in the little candle guy. But in conclusion, please give this a go if you like your platformers, love candles and hate the dark.

An ambitious little platformer that seemingly came out of nowhere and ended up as an unforgettable, brilliant and gorgeous light in the gaming landscape, not unlike its protagonist.","Candleman lights up the night as a unique experience on Xbox One. Its use of light makes even the most basic puzzles and platforming challenges a lot of fun to play through. As I became more and more absorbed into the world of Candleman, I found connections with the protagonist that I never expected to share with a candle. And perhaps the unexpectedness of Candleman is that the time I spent with the game felt refreshing. I never found myself needlessly frustrated at the difficulty, rather; I found myself in a constant state of shock and awe as each new part of the journey offered exciting new opportunities. Candleman is a timeless tale meant for nearly all ages only hindered by a myriad of technical issues.",,"It’s not the fact that you’re controlling a perambulatory candle that’s the oddest thing about this game, but that its story is so oddly affecting despite its absurdity.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Candleman is a special indie game that has a lot of heart. Its story is surprisingly dark, no pun intended, but it seeks to offer an insightful life lesson, much like Spotlightor hoped to achieve with its games. Through solid platforming sections with a touching journey, it is easily worth peoples’ time, who may learn just how precious that is once they play this title.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"That's the unpredictable allure to Candleman. Its obvious hook is in its unique mechanic, but that's not enough to carry it to the conclusion. Then, there's a Rudy-like emotional investment that takes over when everything stops revolving around gameplay. Fittingly, Candleman burns out prematurely. But, that doesn't mean that it stops shining.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you're looking for an adorable game with tight platforming, a unique lighting mechanic, fantastic graphics and level design then Candleman if for you.",,"With its relatively short length, storybook-like progression and focus on a charming coming-of-age tale that offers surprising maturity, Candleman might be found sitting alongside Journey and The Unfinished Swan, although it’s lesser in scope.

Essential for any self-respecting The Walking Dead fan, regardless of whether you played seasons one and two in Telltale's series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The opening two episodes set the stage for the new adventure. They have everything you've come to expect from The Walking Dead: shocking deaths, intense betrayals, and split-second decisions to second-guess.

battlefield-v,,,,,,"Battlefield V’s content depth may indeed be lacking, though even so, the content that is on offer remains explosively robust from the onset. The campaign is relatively engaging and emotional, and the multiplayer is every bit as action-heavy as it ever has been. That said, if you’re looking for a varied shooter, you may want to hold off until DICE adds in its additional story, its battle royale mode, and its extra maps.","Thankfully, even as some features are conspicuously absent, nothing else in Battlefield V feels rushed. It's a smooth experience, offering yet another audiovisual master class, and regularly delivers a true sense of spectacle in a way that other console shooters simply can't match.",,"Battlefield V manages the series' formula in many aspects, offering us one of the most entertaining multiplayer FPS experiences to date. On the other hand, though, it feels a bit underdeveloped with an overly short and somewhat dull single-player campaign and an overall lack of contents. It will definitely be a better and richer game in some months, when more content will have been delivered.","Battlefield V is not a big audiovisual step up from Battlefield 1, nor does it have a great campaign or important new game modes. But in return it brings us the best multiplayer in the series in playable terms and the promise of Tides of War: the free and regular updates of the game with new content and features.","There's no doubt that Battlefield series is still going strong, and this V is probably the best game of the franchise.","The lack of polish in some of the systems will get improved with patches, but the missed opportunities with the campaign content frustrate the full package. But ultimately, this is one of the best multiplayer shooters you will play this year, and maybe the best until the next Battlefield. So if you love competitive FPS games, yes, you have to buy this.",,"If you’re a fan of Battlefield then there is every reason to jump in with this year’s title, but if you want to experience the game as the developers have obviously intended, I suggest you hold off, enjoy the other amazing games released this year and come back to Battlefield V in about six months’ time when it’s no longer in its current state of being a glorified beta with a triple-A price tag.",,,,Battlefield V ultimately feels like a lateral release with little pushing the franchise forward when you judge it by what’s here and not what may or may not come.,Battlefield V is a solid experience crafted from BF1 for BF1’s fans. It’s a great start for a game that in the next months (hopefully) is going to show its true potential.,"Battlefield V doesn’t do anything out of the ordinary, but it’s atmospheric, tense and wildy entertaining.",,"Battlefield V was a nice return for me. With a few little issues here and there, I was able to look past them and get a nice multiplayer focused game that has seemed to improve a lot since Bad Company 2. Emphasis more on teamwork and class roles has given it an identity and is more than just a spawn, kill, die game. Battlefield fans should pick this one up, and I think casual first person shooter fans looking for a quick fix with some pretty great visuals can’t go wrong here either.",,,,"Battlefield V builds upon its predecessor in meaningful ways, DICE stripping away practically every one of the series' fripperies to get to the nub of what truly makes the series tick. This is Battlefield at its most undiluted and raw, and it's all the better for it.",,,,"Battlefield V offers a compelling single-player and multiplayer package, although it's not the complete reinvention that you may have hoped for.",,,The finest war game of 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"On day one, the game feels a few reinforcements short to pull off the overwhelming victory we’ve come to expect given the series’ strong lineage.",,,"Battlefield V retains heart in its single player War Stories mode and variety in its multiplayer modes. New & improved personalisation within 'Your Company' gives each of the classes a fresh, personal feel to your soldiers, while remaining authentic to the era. A solid road map of content is set to deliver new maps, modes and seasonal events to keep gamers coming back, which is a good thing as no other game does raw gun play and bullet physics quite like Battlefield. It just feels right and Battlefield V is no exception.","Despite its slow rollout, Battlefield 5 is a fantastic multiplayer experience, especially across the fan favourite Conquest and large-scale Grand Operations.",,"If you're looking for a multiplayer shooter that offers more than twitch-based gameplay and is not strictly focused on kills, then you should definitely give Battlefield V a try.","A good but incomplete game that tries to improve every part of Battlefield 1, and achieves it... While falling short on content on its release (no coop, no battle royale, only 3 short campaigns...)","Battlefield V reconfirms its usual and granitic certainty in multiplayer, while the single player campaign fails to strike as we would have hoped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Battlefield V is flawed at launch, but it’s clearly a game that is only going to get better with time.","Battlefield's traditional strengths remain firmly in place amid DICE's return to World War II: great graphics, audio, and a scope that few other games can equal. But it's a thinner package than usual, and the decision to hold important modes like Firestorm until 2019 feels like a crucial misstep. Battlefield 5 is a good shooter as it is, but we wouldn't blame you if you decided to wait until it's had some time to mature.",,"Battlefield V is a good FPS that invites to review everything related to the Second World War. The slight changes in their game dynamics make it much more fun than before, however, the design of their maps and even their characters is less bright than in their previous game. Including a campaign mode is something that many of us greatly appreciate, but it feels repetitive and, although its narrative is good, I do not think it stays in the hearts of the players. Although in general its sound and visuals are impressive, it has some scratches in its programming that take part of its brightness to one of the most striking sections of the game.",,"This is a Battlefield experience through and through. However, I find myself staring more at the gaps in the menus than the accessible parts that are there. The promise of future content is a great thing, but not when you are constantly reminded of the voids it will fill. Fans will love this entry, and rightfully so, but in its current form Battlefield V won't be recruiting any new soldiers to this battle.",,,,,,"Battlefield V has the potential to be the best game in the series. It’s recaptured the magic of those Battlefield moments at almost every opportunity, and its new mechanics like squad revives and attrition put the focus back on sticking with your teammates. There are still a lot of questions it needs to answer with its Tides of War live service, and more casual players might be turned off by the challenging gunplay, but what we have now is a worthy successor to the Battlefield name.",,,"Fans of the Battlefield franchise will find that despite its flaws, Battlefield V warrants a return trip to World War II. If we look at raw numbers, there's less content than before, but the quality of the maps remains the same, and free DLC is on the way. Some old modes, like Frontlines, feel like a slog, while new modes like Grand Operations feel quite quick despite having longer intended play times. The game looks gorgeous, but it still has some graphical issues that need to be ironed out. Despite all of this and a number of bugs that are already being addressed by DICE, BF5 still manages to retain all of the traits and quirks that make the Battlefield series feel exhilarating.","What's here is enough to be going on with, but we'll have to wait till next year's updates and in particular, that possibly seismic battle-royale mode, to discover whether this is truly a Battlefield that stands apart.

Its adrenaline-filled, large-scale battles give rise to memorable moments simply not seen in other games, and these moments are augmented by the faithful Second World War setting. Those looking for an alternative to the twitch-driven combat of other popular shooters will find it here.",,,Battlefield V is a welcome return to the fast paced massive multiplayer games that the series is known for. Even though it lacks in map counts and has a few missing modes that are coming in the future it is a surprisingly complete package. It makes a very competent first impression and promises a longevity that Battlefield 1 never did.,,,,,,"If DICE is telling the truth and Battlefield V develops into a long-term, always evolving online game, fans are in for a treat. The bones of BFV are robust. It looks outstanding, plays great, and the stories of World War 2 are a constant draw for history fans. There are rough patches for the time being, but if those get smoothed out and the content pipeline remains full, Battlefield V stands to have a very, very long shelf life with shooter fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s unfinished, but I’m highly optimistic that it will improve as new content releases and its Battlefield multiplayer at its finest, and that alone may sell the game for the longtime veteran considering what’s to come.

It’s clear that A44 was influenced just as much by The Legend of Zelda, and even more niche adventure titles like Shadow of the Colossus, as it was by From Software’s seminal Souls trilogy. Adventure game fans and Dark Souls fans alike definitely won’t want to miss out on what Ashen offers.",,,,"With an amazing art design and a polished and clean atmosphere, Ashen is far more than a basic Dark Souls clone.

A44 did a tremendous job developing a game that is worth every penny of the $39.99 asking price.

Back then they took a lot of time to defeat and there were patterns and ways to do certain tricks to win and defeat the opponents so they can win the game.

Aside from occasional pathing problems, there isn't much to complain about here. They've gone to great lengths to give Pillars the beautiful presentation it deserves, creating a rich world and atmosphere. Each background is painstakingly hand-drawn and every line has been given life through voice acting.

The game from Daedalic Entertainment cannot be missed if you are a lover of point and click genre and historical literature.","The marriage of historical context, politics, intrigue, and tight adventure mechanics make The Pillars of the Earth an easy recommendation for fans of narrative-based games.

If you happen to have some willing friends or family around and want something to brighten up an evening, you really can’t go far wrong with Moving Out.",,,"Whether or not you’re starving for your next couch co-op game, Moving Out is a lot of fun and should be played by anyone who likes fun team-based games.

This game frustrated me. Deeply. In much of the same way Overcooked did. But Moving Out never entirely lives up to the bar set by Overcooked. At times it feels unfocused, scattered, and above all else, inconsistent in its rules. But where the technical side of the game lacks, the flair and pizazz of everything make up for it.

Plus, some of the boss mechanics lean a little too heavily on the side of increasingly more difficult patterns to learn. That being said, it’s still worth checking out. Immortal Redneck is the sort of game that seemingly comes out of nowhere, where initial curiosity leads to hours of fun. For fans of old school shooters and the rouge-lite setup of games like Rogue Legacy then it’s well worth equipping Grandpa’s Blunderbuss and venturing into a pyramid filled with adorable but dangerous snakes and flying skulls.","It may not immediately strike as a must-play title, but Immortal Redneck shouldn’t be overlooked. With tons of replayability, tense fast-paced gameplay, fluid controls and enjoyable combat, this is a game that will offer great gameplay for hours on end.",,,,,,"Immortal Redneck is a game that rarely frustrates, even though it'll kick your ass. Repeatedly. Why? Because it always feels fair.

While both are displayed at 1080p, the Xbox One version upscales the game from 720p resolution.

Some gamers may thrive in a game that literally gives you every option you could ever think of in addition to a ton of quests and challenges to keep you on your toes.

bridge-constructor-portal,,,,,,,"Bridge Constructor Portal is still Bridge Constructor. The inclusion of GLaDOS, dark humor and Portal staples like gels, turrets and companion cubes will be appreciated by fans, but it's not enough to overcome the tedious core gameplay. Once you have the satisfying 'a-ha!' moment of solving a puzzle, you come to the unfun part: painstakingly piling up dozens of little triangle formations to create supports for your structures. The formula gets old quickly as the puzzles start to require more elaborate building, and we come back to that word: tedious. Players who know they enjoy Bridge Constructor will be at home with Bridge Constructor Portal, but those who disliked past games in the series should steer clear, despite the tantalizing Portal branding.",,"Portal's turrets, switches and obviously portals are a perfect fit for ClockStone's physics-based puzzler.

But the final result presents us with a more than remarkable puzzle game, challenging and absorbing. Bridge Constructor Portal takes the mechanics and physics of the work of Valve to enrich its studied formula greatly and remind us that there was a day when the company of Gabe Newell made great games for the memory.","Bridge Constructor: Portal is a wonderful game that fans of the Valve saga and those looking for a challenging puzzle game will love. Fun and satisfying, with everything that characterizes a title of the Portal saga.",,,"Puzzle games need ‘eureka!’ moments and Bridge Constructor Portal has those in abundance, counteracting the progressively difficult levels.

Next up, Bridge Constructor Half-Life? Play it. For science.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm glad we have another good Portal-adjacent title. Bridge Constructor Portal perfectly combines aspects of both games to create something uniquely challenging. It's obviously a pick-up-and-play casual game that's not quite at home on consoles, but the gameplay at its core is great nonetheless. It would still be a great game without the Portal aesthetic, but it wouldn't have made me smile nearly as much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bridge Constructor Portal is a fantastically challenging puzzle game that is dressed in $10 looks. You will not be awestruck by anything the game does, but the challenge will have you wanting more, the humor will keep you smiling, and the silly horn at the end of the level will be enough to know you did it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sure, having something with more narrative and GLaDOS would have been welcomed, but like most puzzle games, I accept it for what it is, and you’ll get what you want out of it if you’re a fan of the genre.

If you’re able to overlook that and focus on the first 95% or so that’s highly satisfying, you should still go for it, since the journey up to that point is extremely well-done, but if you want any sort of closure, be aware before you go into it that this game’s ending is going to drive you nuts.","A fascinating and mysterious adventure with a great teen thriller plot, charming characters and outstanding visuals and sound design. The whole story captivates the player flowing quickly, to the point that its ending arrives even too soon; a couple more gameplay hours wouldn't have hurt.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Oxenfree is a smart, emotional adventure that feels focused and purposeful.

The weapon and vehicle customization options and the addition of Nightmare Mode give Dead Rising 3 the legs it needs to stay in constant rotation on your Xbox One.","Luckily, the game gets close to finding a happy medium between Dead Rising's signature weirdness and a slightly more traditional open-world format that makes this by far the most approachable game yet in the series.",,"It's not the perfect sample of a ""next-gen"" game and the basic design has been slightly changed, but Dead Rising 3 is mindless fun, has tons of content and stays true to the Dead Rising spirit.",Dead Rising 3 provides plenty of zombie killing fun and is a great game to pick up if you bought an Xbox One. Newcomers to the series will find an incredibly fun game with tons of replay value and co-op fun. Returning fans will find the same thing but may be turned off a bit due to the fact that the core game hasn't really changed all that much.,"Dead Rising 3 expands the gameplay of the series to a big city, Los Perdidos.

Unfortunately, the graphics are not something we can define as ""next-gen"".","Funny, big and inventive. Maybe it's not the next-gen gameplay revolution that many were waiting for, but Dead Rising 3 is sure to keep its fans busy for a long time.","For once, I actually felt overwhelmed in a zombie outbreak, which is a real example of how next-gen technology can be used to do more than simply ""make things look better.""","Like its predecessors, Dead Rising 3 offers good, dumb, fun, with just enough story and structure to keep you moving forward and enough opportunities for zany antics to maintain your amusement throughout.","It may shuffle along technically but there's no denying the fun to be had in Los Perdidos.

The result is an open world that, in spite of its reanimated inhabitants, feels more alive than most.","As a package, Dead Rising 3 is probably the most fully-fledged first-party title for the Xbox One.","Capcom Vancouver has therefore given the Xbox One something that PS4 does not have right now: a strong triple-A exclusive. Dead Rising 3 dares you to dream about high the bar can be set for the open world game during this generation on a technical and creative level, even with its obvious flaws in mission design. Not bad for a launch title.","Dead Rising 3's biggest improvement is its accessibility.

If you seek a fun sequel to Dead Rising 2, with some new things, then the game is for you, no hesitations. Still as fun as before and populated with a large number of zombies, it delivers a good dose of action. On the other hand, if you're hoping that this launch title stuns you with it's graphics or revolutionizes the franchise, you will be disappointed because it simply is not the case. If the fun is present, the ""wow, that's unseen"" effect is clearly missing.",,,"Despite its imaginative exterior, the game adheres to a surprisingly rigid design. After a while I felt as though I was just going through the motions, dispatching hundreds of zombies simply to get to the next waypoint on my map...But it takes a good while for the disillusionment to set in.",,"A pretty good title, with solid gameplay mechanics and a lot of gore. Unfortunately Nick is a really anonymous character and the game presents some frame rate drops with a myriad of technical issues. A good start for Xbox One but from this new console we expect much more.",,"With Dead Rising 3, the Xbox One has a great launch title. Expect hundreds, even thousands, of zombies on your screen who are all waiting to get mowed down by you.

That sure is entertaining. Unfortunately boredom sets in, in a matter of hours. The 'normal' running, driving and killing isn't broken up enough by interesting things to do or events and the open world might be huge, but that's also why it bores. Luckily the game is fully playable in coop, which makes everything more enjoyable.",,,,,"The third installment turned out quite good and throws the series killing spree into an open world setting. It could use a little bit of tuning here and there but in overall, it’s so much fun! [Issue#238]",,,,"It’s fun. It’s as fun, if not more, than any of the previous games. It’s not going to change the world ten times over, but for a launch title, this is where we should be.",,,,"The city of Los Perdidos is a bit too massive for its own good, but there is plenty to do and kill within its limits. And with an impressive next-gen presentation and endearingly spastic boss encounters, Dead Rising 3 is an easy recommendation to any new Xbox One owner.",,,,,,,,,,"Capcom Vancouver shot for a much larger world and, in the end, that idea wound up taking away from the overall experience.

There's no denying that mowing down crowded streets full of zombies isn't a guilty pleasure. What Dead Rising 3 lacks, though, is next generation visuals. The game could easily pass as a fancy looking Xbox 360 title. [Feb 2014]",,,"Dead Rising 3 is a lot of fun. It’s also a lot of zombies, a lot of cheesy story, a lot of uninspired graphics and a lot of crazy weapons and costumes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dead Rising 3 is the weakest in the series, then...Just beware, once you get over the pleasure of the first few combo weapons, Dead Rising 3 is just a solid zombie brawler set in an open world, not the strange game of tender heart that used to be so funny and surprising.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Some parts of the game come off as half-baked, but killing innumerable zombies is always fun. [Feb 2014, p.63]",,"None of Dead Rising 3’s issues will stop you from enjoying the ludicrous ways you can kill zombies. While it may initially appear to be a more somber game than before, after spending a few hours with Dead Rising 3 you’ll realize the spirit of the series is well intact.",,"Dead Rising 3 will likely go down as one of the quintessentially ""good"" launch titles seen when a new console releases. It's an exclusive title with a big open world and tons of zombies that demonstrates the power of the next gen console well.",,,,,,,"Dead Rising 3 is undoubtedly fun, and cleans up a lot of the messiness found in previous Dead Risings, but it’s still not the complete antidote to the series’ slowly decaying zombie antics. It also doesn’t take much advantage of the new hardware. Don’t blame the Xbox One, though — this launch-day release is limited primarily by the constraints set by the original’s creaky mechanics and gameplay clichés way back in 2006.","It knows that all you really want to do is discover and create new playthings to dismember the undead. As a vehicle for that, it's a comfortable ride.","Dead Rising's formula is not as fresh as it once used to be, but it still offers you many bizarre situations riddled with zombies and weird weapons.","If I want serious adult drama, I’ll watch The Walking Dead. But for sheer, unadulterated fun, Dead Rising 3 has my thumbs, eyes, brain and heart. Or, as a zombie would call it, a well-balanced breakfast.",,"Dead Rising 3 is more of the same, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t compulsive, time-absorbing and – most of all – fun...At best it’s an unoriginal concept well-executed, at worst it’s an Xbox 360 game hastily ported over to Xbox One. Ignore the technical limits, however, and you’re in for a good time.","If it’s a true “next-generation” game you’re after, look no further than Dead Rising 3. Capcom Vancouver’s gory, over-the-top zombie thriller is a technological masterpiece that amply showcases the power of Microsoft’s new Xbox One console. But more importantly, it’s also immensely and outrageously enjoyable.","A fun, wild waste of time that doesn't really live up to its predecessors.",,,Get ready for a new generation of zombie-slaying thrills where there's only minimal gameplay to get in the way of the thrills!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I highly advise giving it a go seeing as it’s free.",,,"Strong characters and environmental storytelling make The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit enjoyable overall.

It may not be a long tale, but this pre-amble to what’s to come for LiS showcases that there is plenty of life in the franchise no matter who is in it thanks to the rock-solid storytelling foundation on display.",,"Instead of feeling like the first chapter in a multi-part story, The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit is more like a snapshot. It only takes a couple hours to finish, and depicts a routine day in the life of Chris and his dad. It has explicit connections to the upcoming Life is Strange 2 that have me excited, but The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit also stands alone as a clever and heartbreaking look at a kid who deserves better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit is the endearing, heartbreaking tale of a kid who imagines himself to be a superhero. It's not very long at 2 hours tops, but Dontnod Entertainment uses this teaser for Life is Strange 2 to show they still have the stuff to tell a great story. Captain Spirit isn't really a complete story though and you'll leave this experience with more questions. Ones that will likely be answered in the next game.",,,,,,,,,"The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit functionally serves as a playable teaser for the sequel to Life is Strange. Because of this, we never get real resolution to Chris' story. It ends on a gratuitous cliffhanger, and that's so predictably frustrating. But Captain Spirit uses its two hours well to craft a narrative that leaves us wanting more. That was the whole point. Chris may be a superhero but he's also an underdog. Everyone loves a good underdog story.",,,,"The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit is an easy recommendation for Life is Strange fans as well as for those who have never touched the series before. Clocking in at 90 minutes, the episode can easily be completed in a single sitting; the episode's characters, on the other hand, will stay with you long after you put down the controller.

I love the deliberate combat and how each fighter feels entirely unique. I wish the online was more active, but even the amount of single player modes and promise of new characters means I will be revisiting this for a while.

It's a fun and quirky beat-em-up, though the lack of online in all the modes offered feels like a bit of a missed opportunity.","The title features exceptional pixel art with dozens of clever easter eggs, special modes like a survival horror experience and dodgeball, and even rounds things out with a frankly spectacular chiptunes soundtrack composed by Anamanaguchi. It hasn’t aged a single day since its first release back in 2010, though it does suffer because of a gap in new Scott Pilgrim content since 2014 and 2021.",,"Scott Pilgrim vs The World The Game - Complete Edition has just about everything going for it that beat’em up action fans like to see. Just watching someone play the game makes it look incredibly fun, but once you play it yourself and notice the sluggish controls and random bad hit detection (among other problems), it dampens the experience. The game still holds up quite well as a ten-year-old beat’em up action game however. If you’re hungry for a new beat’em up and have already played Streets of Rage 4 and Castle Crashers then Scott Pilgrim is worth a shot since it is definitely a unique game despite its problems.",,,"Scott Pilgrim vs The World is a game made with love and full of charm, but this complete edition is also a missed opportunity to celebrate it.

A lot have become accustomed to the realistic graphics and heavily detailed designs of current AAA games, and in that case, Scott Pilgrim isn’t likely to change their mind for their preference in games, nor convince them to play it. For the indie loving or retro fan like me, this was exactly what I needed to remind myself of the joy and the frustration of the genre.",,,,,,,,,,,"I had high expectations for Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game Complete Edition and, even with my grievances, I can see why it is so beloved all these years later.

The big difference this time is that Scott Pilgrim is here to stay thanks to the “Power of Love.”",,,,,,,,"Beat 'em ups were flatlining when Scott Pilgrim was originally released. A decade later the genre is in rude health, but it's a testament to the game's quality that it still stands tall as one of the better examples.

There are things I’d still love to see improved like animation, replays, and further deepening of the career mode.

I did not expect anything from PGA Tour 2K21, maybe those low expectations have played in his favor I do not deny it, but the truth is that I have found a good game in him. Its adaptability to different levels, the feeling of progress in your game, the local multiplayer and that feeling of not being able to leave the controller on the table and always wanting a little more are its greatest supporters. I hope that the community will give this title a chance that it needs it to continue growing and improve its deficiencies for future iterations.

call-of-duty-infinite-warfare,"A mechanically sound shooter that's hampered by a lack of scale and inventiveness. [Jan 2017, p.88]",,"Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is not the abomination haters would want it to be but it is clear that the franchise is going through an identity crisis. Under its bizarre sci-fi concept, the campaign still has some of the core elements you would expect from the single player mode, but the overly convoluted structure of the multiplayer, chaotic rhythm, the flashy presentation of Zombies in Spaceland and a few technical hiccups will make you hesitate when calling this a Call of Duty game.",,,,"With an enjoyable campaign and zombies mode, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is still a worthwhile purchase, although your mileage may vary when it comes to the game's competitive multiplayer. The campaign in particular is well-acted with moments of levity and gravity. However, while these are still good games to play, the now ordinary gameplay may feel a bit stale, particularly for those who have kept up with the series' annual releases for the past decade. After a particularly good year for the first person shooter, Call Of Duty is not a particular stand-out, a far cry from the series must-buy status at its height.","The campaign is really good, the competitive multiplayer is pretty boring, and the Zombies in Spaceland mode is lighthearted fun. As a whole, the package is a little disappointing, especially if you put a lot of weight onto the MP side of COD. But if you're down for another solid, entertaining shooter campaign, then I think Infinite Warfare is definitely worth a look.","Infinity Ward's new game introduces an exciting new campaign while being more conservative on the multiplayer side, with a mix of Ghosts and BO3 mechanics. The end result is a good but not outstanding game, something that will please lovers of the series but won't do anything to attract new or lapsed players.",,,"Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is the perfect way to keep the Call of Duty franchise fresh. This series can't just stick with modern warfare and past wars every single year. Moving to the far future allows for the introduction of new mechanics, equipment, and especially environments that couldn't be done in other time periods. Not only do series followers get something new here, but science fiction fans who've never touched a Call of Duty will find much to like as well.",,,,,"There's a massive amount of content in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, though especially if you played Black Ops 3 last year there’s little of it that’s particularly impressive.",,,,,"An interesting entry for the series. The parts I enjoy have been improved, and are the best they have been in years. The campaign is one of my favorites of the year, and Zombies continues to innovate and find ways to be super fun. The multiplayer though feels throwaway and not all that exciting, which is what gives the series legs. The inclusion of Modern Warfare Remastered softens that blow, but I am curious how the community will react over time.",,,,"We'll be damned if Infinity Ward hasn't gone and pulled it out of the bag this year. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is yet another delectable dollop of shooty blockbuster entertainment that somehow manages to exceed expectations. Yes, it hasn't really come all that far and no, Infinity Ward hasn't reinvented the wheel. But as Call of Duty experiences go, Infinite Warfare hits the mark.",,,"While no Call of Duty game has matched the comprehensive excellence of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, the exploits of Reyes and Ethan are at least as memorable and moving as any deeds from “Soap” MacTavish and John Price during from the series' heyday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Infinite Warfare could have been much more than a passable single-player movie attached to a super fast, super confident multiplayer infrastructure. As such, and with those moments of tantalising potential in mind, it feels like a wasted opportunity.",,,,"Infinite Warfare features a compelling single-player experience with plenty of optional missions for those looking for more, and robust multiplayer modes for players of every style, whether you’re leading the scoreboards in kill confirmed or goofing around with friends taking on an alien invader in an over-the-top amusement park.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is a definitive evolution for the franchise, an evolution we desperately needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is a mess. There is fun to be had but there it really feels like Infinity Ward really had no idea what direction they wanted to take the series in. Space battles are fun, the campaign missions are fun and the new Zombies mode is a blast, but everything else is just so mediocre that it really brings down the experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Though I wasn’t sold on the futuristic setting for the campaign, it still showed promise for the future of the franchise when it comes to storytelling and character development. And while its multiplayer feels far safer than the disappointing experience to be had in Ghosts, Zombies in Spaceland is one of the most enjoyable incarnations of the mode since its inception both when you’re playing with friends and alone. It’s not the quantum leap fans may have hoped for, but it’s a solid starting point for future expeditions.",,,,,,,,,,"In a way, what makes Call of Duty Infinite Warfare so successful is personality, whether that’s via creative future tech, or the earnest single player story or even the over the top Zombie mode. This has been an incredible year for shooters. Thankfully, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare completes 2016 with a bang.",,,,,,,"If the zombie mode in your game is the part that feels best, you know you have some patching to do. It just feels very unbalanced and rushed here at release.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"As a whole Infinite Warfare is not perfect game, but that doesn't make it a bad game as all three gameplay elements (story, multiplayer, cooperative) combine to make a solid game that fans, and even non-fans, can enjoy and one that shouldn’t be overlooked this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bottom line, Starlink brings toys-to-life, back to life.","The game makes for a fun adventure with a bit of a family-friendly leaning, and allows you the freedom to chase mission markers or just slow down and explore. A good variety of missions will please any players who haven't yet grown weary of the developer-publisher's oft-seen open-world design, making Ubisoft's risky project a game that shoots for the stars and in many ways manages to get there.",,,"A different and brave game with addictive mechanics and a story in space. The exploration can be repetitive after hours, but technically it is remarkable and very interesting.","A surprisingly fun title, that can be very accessible, rich and complex at the same time. If you're a spaceship games lover and even if you're not you're gonna have a hell of a lot of fun.","An impressive experience. It's a shame that the story and limited exploration options hold the title back. The game could've rivaled some of the best space exploration games out there, but its need to appeal to a younger crowd undoubtedly takes away from the package.",,"No matter what you may think of the whole toys to life idea that Ubisoft are pushing, the truth of the matter is that Starlink: Battle for Atlas is a very good game that should be embraced by all – with or without the physical additions. It brings together a great story, some utterly stunning visuals, and superb sound. These mix well with a variety of quests, missions, objectives and codex fulfilments that wouldn’t look out of place in the likes of Assassin’s Creed.",,,"With or without the unnecessary toys, Starlink: Battle for Atlas is a commendable space adventure. Even with the repetitive grind and randomly scattershot space combat, this is a great-looking, gratifying game of strategic action and environmental exploration. Switch owners are undoubtedly the winners, but there’s something here to enjoy on any platform.",,,,,,,,,,"Clearly, Starlink: Battle for Atlas is repetitive and its storytelling is more than conventional. But the dogfight and the big open world are just so much fun.

With a small fleet of ships at your disposal, it can be a lot of fun to progressively assault and weaken the Forgotten Legion's hold on the galaxy. It's just a shame that if you're interested in the physical models, you'll have to spend more to get the same experience as the digital version.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A bonafide toys-to-life title in many respects, if more of a hybrid flavor than past efforts, and that will probably scare certain people away. But even if you strip out all the expensive extras, you can still play everything digitally (the deluxe digital edition includes all ships, characters and weapons), and on top of that, the game is simply really, really good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Starlink: Battle for Atlas is a solid game, and one that could be the start of a franchise that could, and should, get a sequel or two. The toys aren’t necessary to play, but they are great looking and solid models that are very functional given how easy it is to add or swap out weapons. The problem here is that the toys will add up in term of dollars spent if you want to collect them all. And yes, Starlink can feel repetitive at times, but the control, visuals and sound, and the RPG-lite features make for a pretty good gaming experience. I really did enjoy my time with Starlink: Battle for Atlas and I have no problem recommending it to any gamer out there.",,,,,,,,"The incredible sights and sounds and satisfying mechanics of Starlink: Battle for Atlas make exploring its gorgeous planets a joy.

I’m not a big fan of first person aerial combat and would have liked a 3rd person option (especially as we don’t get a VR option on Xbox) though.

The game is a respectable dabbling in the genre, but when Robert’s adventure finally reaches its conclusion (and it will have you saying ‘finally’), don’t expect to feel like you accomplished much of anything at all.","The Inner World is a solid adventure game that’s whimsical yet dark, and accessible to those who may not have much experience with adventure games. I think I’ll be playing through this again, somewhere down the line. For an adventure game, that’s high praise from me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If The Inner World was released in the 90s, I'm certain it would be held in the same high regard as classics like Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle. It's a fantastic point-and-click adventure game that handles humor and puzzles with ease. If it weren't for those clunky controls, it'd be a lot easier to recommend. The Xbox One certainly isn't the ideal home for this game, but it's a much-welcomed addition to its library regardless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"On the whole, The Inner World is a fantastic puzzle game, not to mention a seamless port from PC. A deeply engaging world, satisfyingly challenging puzzles, and a fun story make for a truly wonderful playthrough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Inner World is an intriguing point-and-click adventure with the gameplay you would expect from the genre. The strength of the game relies heavily on its off-kilter dialogue and story, despite some minor issues with controls and lengthy, tedious dialogue at times. Furthermore, the art of The Inner World is charming despite a relative lack of polish, but the saving grace is perhaps the memorable cast of characters that inhabit this inner world. While not perfect, The Inner World is a charming, memorable experience with unique puzzles and a strong narrative.","For players on another console or who are a little luckier with bugs than me, I’d say that The Inner World is generally an enjoyable experience with cute animations and quirky humor — I would definitely recommend it, and based on the number of times my boyfriend turned off his own game to watch me play this one, I would say it’s also good for friends to play together.",,,"Despite a few illogical puzzles and poor controls, The Inner World’s writing shines through to create a decent, amusing adventure.",,,,,,,,,,,,"The humor will constantly having you crack a smile or smirking, and you can’t help but get the sense that The Inner World was a labor of love. Simply put, The Inner World is endearing and charming and I’m glad I got to experience it, as should you. If you’ve been craving a great point and click adventure, or simply want a game with some fantastic visuals, audio, and narrative, look no further than The Inner World and spend a wonderful few hours in the world of Asposia with some memorable characters.",,,,,,,,The Inner World is quite a delightful surprise that manages to keep you hooked to the end with its charming personality and best-in-class hint system. I definitely recommend it for fans of 2D point-and-click adventures and casual gamers alike.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A great point and click game on a console, only mildly let down by it’s slightly frustrating control scheme.

no-mans-sky,"Wonderful for exploration but has some issues with resource management. [Oct 2018, p.75]","Two years after its initial release, No Man’s Sky have developed into a whole different game. Tons of new content, several updates and patches for the online section, more features for crafting system, new missions, and many, many more added features have made NMS a valuable title.",,,"No Man’s Sky Next on the Xbox One/X is still an ambitious experience and although it has been improved in terms of gameplay, control mechanics and visuals, the game is unfortunately still repetitive, however strangely it is quite compelling as you explore your very own universe. It’s also a game that still needs more content, especially when it comes to story and the AI of the aliens that you encounter. Nonetheless, revisiting this game 2 years later is still an interesting and entertaining yet flawed experience.","Don’t be guided by the game’s daunting history. No Man’s Sky is now a near-outstanding experience that sits in a league of its own. Despite some issues with the game’s textures, delayed rendering and some unstable framerates, No Man’s Sky is a diverse, deep and ambitious player-shaped adventure that’s constantly intriguing.","No Man's Sky is tough to recommend because it doesn't nearly have mass appeal. It's a grueling game for far too long and even after that its loop is still too freeform for most players. For the right kind of player, however, it can be an exciting adventure filled with memorable moments and a real sense of discovery. With multiple intriguing storylines that can be chased or ignored, a ton of equipment and upgrades to unlock, and intuitive, easy to use base-building, there's a universe of possibilities to see, provided you can first get off the ground.",,"No Man's Sky is a giant leap from the game's early days, and it comes on Xbox One in its best form, with lots of activities and variety. It's still got wide margins of improvement though, especially in the multiplayer and technical areas, but if there's something Hello Games proved so far, it's their strong commitment to improve the game post-launch.","No Man’s Sky finally comes to Xbox One with its good ideas, some better than others. But above all there are its good intentions and an incredibly beautiful universe that resides in a contemplative experience that is worth a try if you are a patient player.","Does No Man's Sky and Hello Games deserve a second chance? I say yest but without much enthusiasm. No Man's Sky has grown a lot, and right now is a mostly enjoyable game, that still has some flaws, so it should keep growing and evolving, because it still has the potential to be a truly fantastic game soon.",,,"For me, this is a journey where every time I turn No Man’s Sky on I have an idea of what I would like to achieve in this episode, but all it takes is a look through my visor and I see something new on the horizon and I’m off exploring again. I know right now I will never make it to the centre of the universe in my playthrough, but I understand now that isn’t the point of NMS anymore. The point is that, well, you need to discover your own place within this wonderful universe. And I am having an absolute blast in doing so.",,,"It’s mechanically repetitive no matter what planet you’re on, the dull combat should be avoided whenever possible, and bugs are plentiful. But buying new ships and building new things is enough motivation to make it entrancing – for a while, at least.",,"Through its landscapes, its silences and its curious inhabitants, the universe of No Man's Sky delivers an important message in the hands of the player: the journey itself is more important than the destination itself.",,,"As before No Man’s Sky is a game that I enjoyed the most when I was moving under my own steam, plodding along as a leisurely place.

There are still some bugs and the multiplayer is too limited for now but the whole experience is mesmerizing.,,"While features like multiplayer and base-building certainly put more proverbial asses in seats, they're also the least memorable additions to an otherwise thoughtful experience.",,,,,"No Man’s Sky is arguably close to the game its creators set out to make...But after spending another 10 hours in this galaxy, I’m beginning to feel like another interstellar trip is not for me.",,,,,,,"In terms of content this is the game that it should have been in the beginning. Unfortunately problems with too much grind, missing comfort functions as well as redundant planetary exploration still remain.","The ability to explore space with a party of up to three friends makes it feel much less lonely than before. And where it once was difficult to return to a previously visited planet, establishing bases allows you to make some small corner of the universe feel like home.",,,"No Man’s Sky’s most interesting aspect is how the game that seemingly failed in gamers eyes almost two years ago, has risen from the ashes and has been reborn as something spectacular.",,"The updates have brought definite improvement, but even after two years the huge scope and ambition only serves to hide how simplistic and repetitive the gameplay is.",,,,"No Man's Sky: Next can be impressive at times. It is dense with features and the sensation of lift off and breaking/entering a planet's atmosphere is genuinely magical. It is a mixed bag of mostly good things, but has some really low lows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No Man's Sky is an experience designed for a very specific audience.

Hello Games deserve credit for creating one of the best games of this console generation - even if it did take a couple of years longer than planned.,,,,,,,,,"No Man's Sky NEXT is the game that they promised us in 2016. It finally has multiplayer and many other add-ons, but, in the end, its base is still the same: explore the universe calmly.",,,,"Thanks to several major updates No Man's Sky is in many ways a very different experience today than it was in 2016, even though the main gameplay loop is still intact. If you want an exciting story or thrilling space combat, this is not for you. However, if you want a Minecraft-oozing space adventure filled with endless exploration, it fits perfectly. It may not be Star Wars or Mass Effect, but it's your very own space adventure.","No Man’s Sky Next isn't a sequel, but it almost feels like one. The update improves the game a lot and gives it a whole new look of feel.",,,,,"No Man’s Sky has reached a point where not only does it meet initial promises, it now exceeds them.","No Man’s Sky NEXT was a meditative experience for me. The simple loop of landing, scanning flora and fauna, scrounging for minerals, and finally walking up a hill to experience a breathtaking vista never got old. Others may struggle with the game’s openness, and others will likely feel intimidated by such a non-guided experience. But for those craving an experience full of addictive play loops and the ability to go anywhere? This game is for them.","Finally available on Xbox One, during the last two years No Man's Sky has become a huge exploration game, still flawed by technical and design problems, but totally worth a ride.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"No Man’s Sky is a vastly different game compared to its 2016 release. A range of updates, big and small, have culminated in transforming a disappointing space affair into an intergalactic journey that, frustrations aside, is well worth taking.","The small grand moments of wonder and realization can be breathtaking, but they are too far and few between. Granted, that’s with how I played, so it may be completely different for you. The majority of your time will be simply managing your materials and meters, then spending time gathering materials to do what you intended to do an hour ago, only to find out you need another type of material to do a different step of the process. It’s odd to have such a rollercoaster of highs and lows of excitement and frustration, even after learning so much and adapting to its faults.",,,,,,,,"A fun laid-back exploration experience and it has the unique honour of featuring the largest open world in all of gaming. However, don't go in expecting an exciting or challenging campaign because it's simply not either of those things.",,"Technically, No Man’s Sky delivers the idea Hello Games promised — a massive sci-fi playground for you to explore. However, once you’ve spent some time poking around, it’s hard not to notice that the playground feels fairly empty, even two years later and after massive content additions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NEXT is the step forward that No Man’s Sky needed since it was made available two years ago, the online options as well as the third person perspective are both well received additions, however, completely redefining the procedural system of the game is a very difficult task that, in the end, makes it aim for a particular type of player.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
far-cry-primal,"Lacking a map-editor, co-op, and charismatic central villain, Primal sacrifices its forebears' 'big event' status, but this back-to-basics approach makes for an all-natural off-the-reservation romp.",,"Despite some repetitiveness and a bland story, Far Cry Primal feels fresh, exciting and unique. Hopefully this will entice other AAA studios to shake things up a bit.",,,,"While this tale had promise, the lack of a central villain means that the story also lacks focus and is relegated to the sidelines while the side missions take pride of place.",,"Far Cry: Primal adds some interesting and more survival-oriented new mechanics to the usual franchise formula, but the main storyline revealed itself to be quite dull while the environments and gameplay result in a bit too repetitive experience. It remains however an advised buy to open world games lovers, despite its flaws.",,,"Primal is not just a brilliant game, it dramatically and triumphantly reinvigorates the Far Cry franchise.","Which brings us to the key point: is it worth the price of admission? Absolutely. As previously mentioned, it’s a complete, standalone experience and breaks the mold enough that, despite having many familiar gameplay traits, is still a new adventure.",,,,,"While the time period itself may be a far cry from the rest of the series, the game still manages to feel like a natural progression with some core gameplay elements intact, while also adding plenty of content that makes Far Cry Primal feel likes it own distinct experience.",,"Far Cry Primal‘s map is absolutely huge, and is literally teeming with objective markers and missions. I challenge even the most ardently focused of players to travel to their intended location without getting sidetracked on the way.",,,"While this is a different direction for the Far Cry series, Far Cry Primal is an excellent entry into the franchise. While it might not be the best introduction to the franchise, it’s certainly one the fans of Far Cry should definitely check out and those interested in the series will find something incredibly unique, action-packed, and a lot of fun.",,,"With a wealth of new ideas, including taming and controlling animals, a non-linear story and an upgradable village hub, Far Cry Primal isn’t just Far Cry 4 with cavemen. Much of the gameplay will feel familiar, but the additions are just about enough to keep it fresh.",,,There's a fine balance between tension and fun that elevates the whole experience.,,,,,,,,,,"I like Primal the most when it's many systems interact in interesting ways and when it forces me to think of new ways to deal with a powerful predator or a powerful group of enemies, but there are also moments when the entire experience feels to close to both Far Cry 4 and 3.",,,,,,,"Don’t let the lack of a number fool you: This is a full Far Cry experience, with top-notch production and another massive open world to explore.",,,,,,"It's almost hard to believe that a first-person shooter set 9,000 years before the invention of gunpowder could be this enjoyable.","The most realistic prehistoric representation that we have seen, but it lacks a little bit of depth in its gameplay mechanics to become an excellent game.",,,,,"Although it's light on story and can get a bit tedious due to an emphasis on hunting and crafting, there's a lot to like about Far Cry: Primal. A beautiful game through and through, it's as immersive as it is nice-looking, and presents a rich world that is easy to get lost in.","What shined in the story were the tribes’ cultures. It was great to see how Ubisoft created unique, fictional tribes and still made them feel natural and real within the game.",,,"Far Cry has gone the way of Assassin’s Creed, another source of income that’s been left to stagnate so everything that worked can be borrowed by the inevitable sequel.",,,,,,"Far Cry Primal is a perfect example of taking what works, implementing enhancements, and not subtracting from the formula. With scenes of absolute beauty, visceral brutality, and touching emotional notes, Primal does some interesting things and ultimately proves itself a valid and welcome offshoot to the series. Much in the vein of Blood Dragon before (albeit a very different game), Far Cry Primal is a solid all-around and fleshed out addition to the franchise. Although it doesn’t necessarily leap the series to incredible new heights, it does everything it does so well that you’ll just have fun hunting, fighting, and building your Wenja destiny.",,,,"It feels like it has even less of a story than Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon has, but that's because that story is spread incredibly thinly across a large world that's packed with cookie cutter content. There's nothing inherently wrong with Primal, and I found the game's combat systems to be pretty exciting at times, but the structure of the game and most of the tasks you're given are one-note. It's a monotonous grind that gets a good lift from its approach to combat and a handful of other tweaks to the formula, but it's still the formula.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Far Cry Primal is far from perfect but thanks to its historical setting it is a breath of fresh air for the franchise.,"If only Ubisoft Montreal had felt more confident in its wild gambit – if only it had gone further with the Stone Age concept – and we could have been looking at something special. Instead, we have a Far Cry game that feels fun in its familiarity, but is sadly lacking in many integral ways.",,,,,,,,,,,"It’s beautiful to look at, and the idea it’s based on is pretty interesting. Unfortunately the magnificent game world and the interesting beast taming mechanics are not enough to cushion the repetitiveness of the main campaign. An uninspired storyline is the last nail in the coffin, for a game that, while still having solid mechanics, is just not as fun as its predecessors.",,,,,,,,"Longtime Far Cry fans might feel that the prehistoric setting is a re-skinning of the previous titles, but despite any déjà vu, Far Cry Primal remains an enjoyable, highly playable title.",,,,,,,,,,"Far Cry Primal starts off strong, throwing you into a hostile, untamed world and letting you flail until you figure things out. But it's too unfocused, too patchwork in the later stages and too much of a step away from the things that make Far Cry great...Yes, it's thrilling to tame a cave bear then ride it into battle while spitting fiery arrows in all directions. This is a fun adventure that'll keep you occupied for 20 hours or more. But Far Cry Primal is also, inescapably, a lesser entry in a series that's continually raised the bar for itself with each successive release.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It may sound trite, but there actually was something primal about Far Cry Primal in terms of how it handled genre identity. It dispenses with any notions of gritty realism, noir storytelling, or military heroism, and boils things down to brutal violence and plain-old silliness. I found this refreshing.",,,,,,,,,,,The lack of mission variety and combat tools hold the game back from being something truly groundbreaking.,,,,,,,,"Despite the exotic setting, there’s still a pervasive sense of familiarity about Primal. Liberating outposts, saving allies from enemy attacks, swinging on grappling hooks, going on hallucinogenic drug trips, hunting specific critters to unlock upgrades, gathering plants to make ability-boosting concoctions... Hell, Far Cry 4 had us riding elephants and commanding a tiger to shred enemies, so even those experiences aren’t entirely fresh here. Sometimes Primal feels like a brilliant 10-hour Far Cry spinoff that got stretched out into a 25-hour, full-priced game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whatever the case, you won't find many shmups with more universal staying power than Sky Force.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sky Force Anniversary is a polished and slick shoot 'em up but for a solo player it's more miss than a hit. It's really nothing special and there are more flashy games in the same genre available. If you have a friend to play the local co-op with the Sky Force Anniversary is more rewarding experience. Still I would have preferred the classic way of doing shooters instead of a grind festival which makes more sense in the mobile market due to the micro transactions easing up the way for the more impatient players.,,,,,,,"It's not the best shoot 'em up available, but it's definitely a really good one.

It takes about 15 hours to max every character, and I am still trying to figure out how to finish my master data cards, but again without a progress tracker, it makes it incredibly difficult. If you enjoy co-op games with friends I can’t recommend it enough. It is a great game to throw on and BS with friends while mowing down countless hordes of robot enemies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Livelock is a solid twinstick shooter that doesn’t excel at anything but also doesn’t make any major mistakes.,,,,"I am in love with Livelock.

At only $19.99, Livelock is worth every penny, punching well above its weight and contending strongly against a lot of retail titles that offer much less and cost a lot more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Livelock is a great game that features an intriguing story and stellar shooting. The weapons are supremely destructive and the environments are gorgeous. It’s a beautiful title which is enhanced by the fact that it features distinct classes and a deep upgrade system.

Surprisingly simple to learn, the game makes it easy to quickly get in the groove of building and splashes of humor keep you smiling.

golf-club-wasteland,,,,,,"Golf Club: Wasteland is slightly more hit than miss. The overall package contains an enjoyable experience. The music matches wonderfully and exploring the decayed wasteland landscape is a fun experience, but the method by which you do the exploring, i.e. the golfing, leaves a lot to be desired and can be more than frustrating using a controller. The game is priced fairly, $10 USD, for what’s there, so if you want to take a swing I’d say go for it.",,,,,,,,"Fans of golf games are unlikely to be blown away by the golf side of Golf Club: Wasteland on Xbox but they should enjoy the story on offer.

You'll want to settle in with a nice pair of headphones when playing this one, let the game suck you into its unique concept and narrative, and we think you'll have a really good time with it. At a standard price of £8.29 / $9.99, it's a definitely a reasonable fee for an other-worldly round of golf.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Golf Club: Wasteland is one of the best games I’ve played this year.

Ruins of our Earth, devastated by climate change, speak to the player through the music and the chats of the great Radio Nostalgia and the ironic neon signs of Alphaville.

This is unlike any other racer available and manages to effortlessly stand out as a result. Its gameplay systems feed into one another exceptionally well, ultimately producing a robust and distinct experience that comes jam-packed with heaps of replay value.","The high-octane action is constantly intense. It looks and sounds stunning, especially on the Xbox One X, and it's easy to pick up and play initially but has an added layer of depth thanks to its class-based gameplay that will make it hard to truly master.

The foundations, though, have been laid for a bright and positive future, and who knows, a sequel with additional gameplay mechanics can allow for the series to grow into something bigger.

This 2D jewel of the veteran Team 17 returns willing to demonstrate how its first part was not only a cumulative of random hits and that escape from a prison can be tremendously addictive.,"The Escapists 2 wraps superb gameplay up with a retro art style and energetic soundtrack to deliver an addicting, tense, and challenging prison escape simulator that unfortunately is marred by a lack of polish and some overwhelming tendencies in the latter stages of levels. Nevertheless, for $19.99, it's one of the best new indie games on the market.",,"If time management and using your head to think outside the box are things that get you excited, then you’ll no doubt love The Escapists 2. It’s a bloody impressive sequel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Escapists 2 is a sequel that manages to build and expand upon the original game in every way, whilst also still making it a great starting point for newcomers. Those familiar with the concept will still have lots to learn with the new mobile prison challenges and unique escape methods, and the game still has that surprising level of difficulty. At the same time, however, The Escapists 2 offers a lot more instruction than the original, with a new tutorial level, crafting guide and a slightly more linear approach overall. The introduction of multiplayer is also a bonus, giving players, even more, ways to escape and cause general havoc.","When you find the right offbeat item, or barely squeak by a guard in Escapists 2, it's incredibly refreshing. However, the monotony of gathering items and playing errand runner for other inmates sours the experience, and the awkward controls don't help. For those who crave unforgiving challenges, the Escapists 2 brings them in spades, but it often comes at the cost of your patience.",,,,,,,"Better, bigger and more beautiful than its first installment, The Escapists 2 couldn't be much better by itself...

It was slow, extremely frustrating and by no means a casual gameplay experience, but I wouldn't say it’s a bad game. Oddly enough, despite my problems learning the ropes of prison life, and the failure of trying to escape, I still find myself drawn to it. Once you figure out what you are doing, get a grasp of prison life and crafting items, it becomes somewhat addictive. Gamers who enjoy time management will have a lot of fun plotting their escape, and fans of retro games will surely enjoy the pixelated characters and graphics. The Escapists 2 isn't for everyone, but if you're looking for a challenging game with high replay value, or you were a fan of the first game, then you'll definitely want to add this to your Xbox One collection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It might be a little bit too short for the price, but lovers of fast-paced action games should definitely give it a chance.","If you are one of those seeking for an adventure based on final bosses, Furi is a game you can’t miss by any means, due to its wonderful combat system and its great visual design.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Furi is a game all about style and combat, and it nails both of those aspects perfectly. For Xbox One owners that didn’t get a chance to check it out when it hit PS4 earlier this year, I highly recommend diving in now. The combat is fun, and the world is interesting. It actually works in combining several game types and making them work. It is challenging for sure, but never unfair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved Furi, and it excels at what it sets out to do but it is a very niche experience. Fighting a single boss for over ten minutes can be an endurance test in and of itself but failing enough times and having to repeat some bosses for over an hour can get exhausting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Furi isn’t a game that will appeal to everyone based solely on its genre, but its strong and solid combat make it a wonderful game for those who do play it.

samurai-warriors-5,,,,,,Samurai Warriors 5 is definitely for veterans and for those who want to see what all the hype is about for the franchise. There’s a lot to accomplish throughout the title and many different combinations and play styles to choose from. So why not jump in and find one that’s right for you.,,,"Samurai Warriors 5 is a good musou game characterized by all the classical aspects of the series and embellished by a new and very good cel shading anime-like look. It doesn't bring the genre forward and it won't do anything to attract new players, but is still one of the best mousous of recent years.",,"Samurai Warriors 5 is a Musou that wields the feeling of power like a deadly blade, a limitless control powerhouse that turns the game into a divine experience.","Despite the occasional framerate stutter and character pop in, Samurai Warriors 5 manages to be a solid hack and slash experience with an interesting — albeit slightly predictable — narrative.",,"Samurai Warriors 5 is no doubt the best iteration of the mainline series, be it Dynasty Warriors or Samurai Warriors (or even the Warriors Orochi spin-off). As it stands right now, this is as good as it gets for the Warriors series. It has a lot of ideas and systems which integrate in an interesting way, and the core gameplay is as fun as ever. The only caveat here is that the core gameplay loop present feels no different to that which we’ve experienced for the last two decades, and inevitably it will run thin.",,,"Samurai Warriors 5 won’t shock anyone who’s played one of Omega Force’s Warriors games before, but it does present a great new style and enough over-the-top action to keep you coming back.",Samurai Warriors 5 scratches the musou itch but doesn’t do too much to mix up the formula.,,,,"The team has done a fantastic job of refreshing this franchise, and I am hopeful that they garner some new fans to keep this series of games going for years to come.",,,,,"A very, very traditional musô ... but nevertheless successful. Admittedly, its cel-shadding remains an obvious make-up for a dated technique, but it also causes a reinforced Japanese atmosphere and some appreciable graphic effects; Likewise, the repetitiveness of its missions is an obvious black point but is compensated by a diversity of characters and interesting gameplay, and this despite the criticized reduction of its cast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Samurai Warriors 5 is the ideal chapter to approach the franchise for the first time and retrace the deeds of the valiant leaders experienced during the sengoku era of feudal Japan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Even though Samurai Warriors 5 does not revolutionise the Musou genre, it nonetheless allows newcomers to smoothly start their adventure. It provides an efficient narrative that is simultaneously highlighted by gorgeous cinematics and tainted by a relatively poor staging. Thanks to their experienced background, the team from Omega Force offers us –as always– a solid gameplay with a nice and diverse selection between the 27 warriors. Slaughtering the enemy forces is quite delightful, and what better way to do so than with friends at home? Yet, the outdated technical side is still annoying. To sum up, if you weren’t already a fan of the Musou genre, Samurai Warriors 5 won’t change your mind. Otherwise, you’ll spend some quality time with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Samurai Warriors 5 is a fresh reinvention for a series that was beginning to feel familiar. A story focussed on Nobunaga’s early years takes the bold choice of ditching many series mainstays. However, the combat and overall presentation haven’t received the same level of new blood and remain as over the top and ridiculous as ever. If you’re a fan, SW5 is as fun as it’s ever been.",,,,"Samurai Warriors 5 doesn’t do much to change up the Warriors-formula, but instead distills the pure, casual fun of slicing your way through thousands of enemies to its core. Thanks to a new graphic style and an excellent technical performance, this series has never run or looked better than on the Series X. It is a bit disappointing that the roster of 37 heroes is limited by the 16 weapons they all share, but when standing on its own, without the knowledge of past titles, this game absolutely offers enough content to justify its price and is an absolute blast to play for fans of this particular niche.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it gets slowed down by infrequent issues with AI and sequences that will feel familiar to series veterans, the end result is an atmospheric, dread-inducing, and contentiously biting narrative horror. Even more, above all of those attributes it needed to be terrifying, and holy hell is it terrifying.",,"An incredibly tense horror game, with adult themes and great graphics. Sometimes it can be a bit too frustrating, but you'll be rewarded by a memorable ending. One of the best horror experiences ever.","Outlast 2 takes back the very best from Red Barrels: tension, slaughter and pure survival. It brings us a well-drawn and complex script, starred by Blake Langermann, a character to empathize with. Despite its few playable errors, Outlast 2 and Sullivan Knoth’s sect will manage to sneak into our darkest nightmares.","Outlast 2 delivers a technically flawless horror experience in all aspects. Few games can give us such terrifying experiences. However, it is a single-use game because the mechanics inevitably fall into trial-and-error. Anyway, Outlast 2 is the perfect game to give us goosebumps.","A truly frightening game that has surpassed Outlast in its graphic content and heart-stopping action, I can safely say I'm never leaving the house again.",,"Outlast 2 isn’t a bad game, sure it has its moments that can feel terribly unfair, but in this day and age, that’s something you should expect from a horror game. The story on offer is fantastic and any fan of horror would be kicking themselves if they didn’t try out the gritty and thrilling experience that is found within Outlast 2. From the enemies, to the environment, to the blood and guts and to the scares, everything in Outlast 2 adds to the unique experience that this game brings.",,,,,,"The production values of Outlast 2 are head and shoulders above those of its predecessor and the gameplay has been developed and refined to near perfection. Only the odd frustrating moment of trial and error sours the experience, but the rest of the game is so engrossing that you won’t let the thought of them linger in your mind.",,,,,,"Outlast II should have been everything that the first game wasn't. Instead, it's a bloated, overwrought, and incredibly frustrating survival horror game. Not terrible by any means, but not all that great either. Shame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Outlast 2 has some problems that left me frustrated for most of the first half of the game, as well as some questionable segments later in the game. Even with that said, it also offers a gripping story revolving around the main character and religion, that left much to be interpreted and theorized, yet kept me interested throughout the game. The gameplay won't wow you, but it can offer some solid scares, and will definitely provide players with some disturbing scenery. If you enjoy the horror genre or liked the first Outlast, then you most likely will like Outlast 2. If not, then you may easily get frustrated or turned off by the experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Outlast 2 is one of the darkest games I’ve ever played and it goes to some very unexpected places…but I can’t help but think the first game was better. The sequel does little to distinguish itself from its predecessor aside from the setting and plot. This makes Outlast 2 feel too safe and not risky enough in terms of gameplay. If you’ve never played the first game, you’ll probably really love Outlast 2, but for fans of the original, it’ll feel like the sequel is treading old ground.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This game was so much fun to play. Something about being scared and literally running for your life makes for such a good game. With plot twists along the way that keep the story fresh there is no lack of entertainment within the game. Red Barrels really knows how to get under your skin. Play the game, you will understand. The dark undertones of the game set up the story throughout and constantly make you think wtf, yet you still want more. Buy Outlast 2, be scared, you won’t be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Outlast 2 successfully places you in the boots of an average Joe. As much as we all would like to think that we’d rise to the occasion and be a hero with great evil-killing potential, I think this game most accurately portrays how we’d actually have to cope with such incredible and horrific situations. In this regard the game succeeds one hundred percent - and its infuriating, but in a strangely captivating and ""want to play more"" manner! Well done.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The end result make for a stunning, fascinating tale that never quite loses grip throughout. 11-11 Memories Retold isn’t just a game that you play, it’s a game that you feel.","11-11 Memories Retold is a touching and tearful World War I game that puts the human element on the front lines. Never about being a war hero and always more to do with the real people in uniform and the reasons that brought them there, it's a story that you won't soon forget and even one you can help shape with several tense decisions left to players. Stiff animations and some plot holes hinder the project, but overall 11-11 is among the best World War I stories ever told in video games.",,,,,,"11-11: Memories Retold, however, is still a game worth more than a look-in, and at roughly five-to-six hours, you’ll gain a deep and respectful look at one of the world’s most jarring global conflicts, from the perspectives of the individual.",11-11: Memories Retold is a fantastic way to mark the 100th Anniversary of Armistice Day.,,,,,,"11-11 takes things to the next level, with more realistic characters, brought to life in a way that makes us feel almost like we know them. It’s a tall order for a game to make us care so deeply about its protagonists – especially when it only has a few hours to do so – but 11-11: Memories Retold does so admirably. It’s compassionate, believable, beautiful and touching; it weaves a narrative that’s so carefully strung together.",,,,,,,"11-11 Memories Retold focuses on two different fates and is more intimist than Valiant Hearts: the Great War. It takes some distance with historic reality to tell a well written and luminous tale. Maybe too luminous, though.",,"It's uneven, yes, but there's undoubtedly more good than bad, and there are poignant scenes, tense moments and breathtaking images that will resonate long after the end credits have rolled.",,,"Memories Retold is a memorable and engaging adventure that needed to be made. However, like a history lesson you half paid attention to, that doesn’t necessarily mean it was enjoyable to play. Ultimately, it's good enough to slog through, but that may not be the case for everyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11-11: Memories Retold tells a beautiful story with multiple endings and is a must-play for anyone that loves a story-based game.

batman-the-enemy-within---episode-1-the-enigma,,"The Enigma is a solid start to the second season of Telltale’s adventure. Great story telling, superb character development and exciting action can keep you busy for a few hours, although it remains to be seen how choices can affect future episodes and whether or not different players are able to create different jokers.",,,,,"Telltale is the master of the season debut. They've been building fantastic first episodes for years now. From there, their games have gone in all sorts of directions. Sometimes they've stayed superb, while other times they've fizzled out. The first episode of Batman: The Enemy Within is yet another great debut that does most of the things you'd want it to do. Fans of the last season or the hero in general will no doubt enjoy this first of five episodes. Some part of us can't help but worry that this one will follow too closely in the footsteps of its predecessor, which would mean it won't end as impressively as it has begun. Still, we're choosing to remain optimistic.",,"Telltale was unable to introduce any newness to its old adventure formula, but a strong plot and a very good technical optimization job make this first episode a must buy for all lovers of the genre. Too bad the devs keeps ignoring Italian gamers with lack of localization.",,,,"We’re excited to see where the story goes. And perhaps even more so, we’re excited to say that Season Two of Telltale’s Batman finally delivers a great take on the long-running and iconic character. In its very first episode.","I can’t do anything but recommend getting stuck into this very good start to Batman: The Enemy Within, especially if you enjoyed season one. Big things are coming and it’ll only get better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Enigma lives up to its name of being difficult to understand from start to finish. Telltale is all over the place in this episode, but the desire to be gritty and different is exposed too much, and the story suffers from it, feeling more like an odd one shot than the first part of something larger. Mysteries abound, however, and enough engaging narrative threads are left dangling to potentially right this second season’s direction.",,,,,"Batman: The Enemy Within - Episode 1: The Enigma is easily the best episode of Telltale's Batman story so far. While Season One put the wheels in motion, The Riddler's return to Gotham invites The Agency into town to make its presence felt, while Lucius Fox, Alfred, and Bruce Wayne are still trying to fully come to terms with the events of the first season. The story is a lot tighter, and the animations are well-polished and cleaner, setting the expectation for what to expect throughout the second season.",,,,,,,,"Batman: The Enemy Within is off to another strong start to Telltale’s take on the series. Not everything quite worked, like Riddler’s role within the story, but I have faith that everything will be explained in the coming episodes. The introduction of Waller could mean trouble, but it’s that ‘could’ that makes me excited to see where the story goes.

quantum-break,"Time powers are a fun step forward, but pacing issues keep the story firmly in the past. [May 2016, p.73]",,"Quantum Break is clever and fun, but it falls a bit short of the expectations that its long development process and robust marketing campaign created. The TV show felt uninspired and the decision-making was not as transcendent as we would have liked. The game is good, just not a revolution.",,"Quantum Break is another incredibly satisfying action-adventure mystery from Remedy in the same leagues as Alan Wake and the original Max Payne – bolstered by a bigger budget which has resulted in a terrific cast of actors, complex and intriguing storyline and script, and well-implemented live action television sequences.",,"The time manipulation powers are as special as Max Payne's ""bullet time"" or Alan Wake's fighting with light. The time travel storyline is one that lends itself to discussion, speculation, and adoration among genre fans. Both of these things are then aided by a great cast and truly stunning audio and visual design. Not without missteps, Quantum Break is still an exceptional title that takes chances and looks like the makings of a successful new franchise. In short, it's a hell of a time.","The story, acting and graphics are great, but the gameplay just doesn’t bring enough new ideas to satisfy what I’ve been waiting and hoping for. Add in the fact that the game isn’t very long and it becomes hard for me to recommend Quantum Break at full retail price of sixty bucks.","Remedy manages to deliver its masterwork: a perfectly balanced mesh of storytelling ad shooter action, with adrenaline-fueled and highly spectacular gameplay and great acting, all supported by stunning visuals and a very strong sci-fi plot. A must-have for any action and story-driven experiences lover.",,,"While Quantum Break exposes the Xbox One's technical limitations, Remedy has crafted a masterpiece that earns its place among the best that the console has to offer. Quantum Break is the first thoroughly unmissable, truly unique console exclusive the Xbox One has.","The overall experience, however, is excellent and the delivery of the game and show is handled with aplomb. I just wanted more of it. Combat is truly rewarding when you start playing with the game’s systems and stacking them to craft your own gameplay flair and style, it’s all just a bit easy (and I’m not even just giving myself bigups for being an awesome player). More TV, a little more game, a longer and more carefully handled ending and a challenge boost would have forced my hand to 10/10, easily. But it’s just not all there. Still an amazing experience though, if time travel is your bag.",,,"The elements of a fantastic and creative action game are all present and correct, and at times Quantum Break is indeed both of those things. But unfortunately its various disparate parts tend to get in each other’s way, leading to a needlessly complicated presentation that inhibits anything from shining as brightly as it should.","Quantum Break is an artistically distinct shooter, with a compelling and malleable plot and excellent performances from its main players in both their digital and live-action forms. While I wish more thought had gone into maintaining the thrill of discovering its time-twisting powers from start to finish, it ultimately didn’t prevent me from thoroughly enjoying Quantum Break’s 10-hour campaign, two times over.","Quantum Break has all the things we ask for from a video game and some things that we don't. Great gameplay, impressive graphics and presentation, and an amazing story are all state of the industry from Remedy. I just wonder what this game might have been if the game aspect of it had been fleshed out just a little bit more.","Quantum Break is a visually impressive game with an interesting story and huge production values. Its gameplay lacks something, but this is still an experience which every Xbox One owner should enjoy.","Nothing will prepare you for the sheer joy however that is your ability to manipulate time; not only because it’s a great gameplay tool, but also because of the gorgeous visual effects that it brings to the table and how it enables you to affect the game’s world.","Remedy swung for the fences and hit a homerun with Quantum Break. With an engrossing story, an amazing cast, and the most beautiful visuals on the Xbox One we’ve ever seen, Quantum Break is a masterpiece.","Quantum Break is a Remedy shooter at its core, and fans of the developers know what to expect coming in. The merger of TV and gaming has been sought after for years, but they have somehow managed to pull it off. It works, and that is probably the biggest shock out of the entire package.","I commend Remedy for taking a chance on a different way of storytelling in Quantum Break. Although I didn’t enjoy every aspect of the way it was done, I still had an gratifying experience and would look forward to the next installment.",,,"Like Max Payne and Alan Wake before it, Quantum Break has already left me desperate for a sequel. And with one or two loose threads left dangling tantalisingly, the way is certainly open for one. Quantum Break is another superlative Remedy game, combining story and gameplay to startling effect. I want to go back in time and play it afresh, all over again.",,,"Getting to the end of Quantum Break can be an interesting ride at times, but no matter how impressive the combat is, or how great the game looks, there's no getting around the fact that it's driven by a story with limited appeal and hindered by disappointing design decisions.","It's a game that is over fairly quickly, it misses a trick in combat because Remedy didn't pillage its most famous creation, and it features live action scenes that are best described as enjoyable nonsense. Yet it is just that, enjoyable. Really, really enjoyable once you get to grips with all the powers at your disposal (and level them up). Quantum Break is a glorious use of current-gen power, with the visual fireworks on show making the combat feel positively joyous. As thoroughly entertaining as the whole package is, Quantum Break feels like it managed to reach only 80 per cent of Remedy's potential.",,,,"There's some wonky shooting and a few cringe-worthy story cliches present. But ineffective cover systems and narrative fridges notwithstanding, Quantum Break feels like the first action game taking real lessons from the Netflix binge-watch era, and in that respect, it's a surprising success.",,"Quantum Break's commitment to delivering a rich, layered narrative isn't always conducive to gameplay, but that doesn't diminish how engrossing this is an entertainment experience. The combination of intense time-bending action, gripping story, and cutting-edge presentation make this the kind of game that sucks you in and doesn't let go until the credits roll. While it's not quite as inventive as it thinks it is, Quantum Break is fresh, ambitious, and a heck of a lot of fun.","Quantum Break is a bad movie, but a really good game. It did not convince me with its poor (and poorly told) story and characters that I did not care about at all, but as a shooter it is really enjoyable and creative. [05/2016, p.38]","Though Quantum Break doesn't always meet its own expectations, the results are spectacular when it does.",,"Some parts the handwriting of Remedy veterans is easily recognizable, but the gameplay is stereotyped and uninspiring. Also the proclaimed connection of the game and the live-action series does not work as intended.","While the story and the first class presentation show off Remedy’s skills, the shooter mechanics are not as convincing – even though the time manipulation is pretty cool.","With this time-spanning opus, Remedy Entertainment hoped to unite narrative gaming and linear television for its Xbox One title. But neither comes out of the experiment well.",,"Quantum Break has an identity crisis going on for itself, not knowing if it wants to be a TV show, action game or puzzle platformer. There are elements of everything here, but they’re underdeveloped and improperly paced...Quantum Break is a great game at heart, but it comes with a lot of underutilized potential.",,"Quantum Break isn’t a perfect game; it’s a bold experiment in how two -mediums can tell a larger story, and at times it pays off. It would be foolish for every game to attempt to emulate this form of storytelling, but Quantum Break as a gaming oddity deserves attention. I wish the events of the show were more significant to the main story, but Quantum Break more than makes up for that with some of the best storytelling and gameplay Remedy has ever produced.","Nothing about Quantum Break is bad, but it’s a crude mix of very basic and largely incompatible ingredients. Far from being a disaster it just feels undercooked. Not enough to give you salmonella, but certainly enough to make you wish for something more substantial to get your teeth into.","The best way I can describe Quantum Break is that it’s a game that I never felt compelled to come back to. I never got invested in the experience; when I sat down to play I always enjoyed myself, but I never found any part of Quantum Break to be all that satisfying. It’s obvious that some masterful developers put this game together but the game lacks the intangible grab that truly great games have. Quantum Break for me ends up being a middle of the road third-person action game with some pretty spectacular ideas with shaky execution.",,,,"I have no trouble recommending it to gamers, albeit with a number of caveats. If you're looking for an intense shooter experience, then you should probably pass on it. If you're looking for something that is without a doubt a unique experience in gaming, then you'll find what you're looking for here.","An A+ on its narrative and audiovisual presentation but not near perfect on its gameplay, due to the subjugation of its mechanics to the storytelling. Besides that it's too easy and not very long.","Quantum Break has some breathtaking moments and shoot-outs, but its mechanics are a bit shallow and the story is not that strong.","Quantum Break is a great game, but not the groundbreaking experience you might expect from Remedy. It's so focused on the story that usually forgets about gameplay, not taking advantage of the good ideas its playable core is built upon. But don't get us wrong: Quantum Break is a very enjoyable game, with great moments and solid storytelling, but also feels like a missed opportunity for Remedy to make something better than their previous works.","The end product is a carefully plotted sci-fi game and an underwhelming live-action series (streamed following each of the game’s first four acts), made all the more disconcerting because some of its fine actors shine brighter in their digital incarnations.","Remedy’s latest is the sum of its parts—a decent third-person shooter paired with a fair-to-middling television series—but it wants to be something greater than both. That’s not a bad thing, necessarily. It’s very possible that Quantum Break is the highest evolution of this hybrid form. The problem, I suspect, is with the approach itself. As Jack and Paul learn, some things sound great in theory, but just aren’t meant to be.","Quantum Break emphasizes its narrative, which is sometimes detrimental to its cause. However, despite that fault, what's presented here is a very intricate, interesting and visually stunning game; not to mention one that is very fun to play when it lets the player use its protagonist's time-bending super powers.","All things considered, between a game, live-action show and novel, Quantum Break is one of the most complete and versatile gaming endeavors in recent memory and a phenomenal single-player experience.",Remedy has created something new and special with their bold storytelling and great action sequences. Quantum Break isn't just the best game I've played on Xbox One - It's one of the greatest games I've played in years.,"It has its moments where it bares its drawbacks with muddy controls and foggy direction. Mostly though, Quantum Break stays the course and is easily Xbox One’s newest piece of eye candy. A system seller? Probably not. A must-play for a system owner? Absolutely.",Quantum Break is Remedy’s best game to date. It is their most-polished game so far and accomplishes every goal it sets out to from a narrative perspective.,"Quantum Break is magnificent, pushing the boundaries of what's possible both technically and from a narrative perspective.","It has a few stumbles in its pacing and action, but it combines historic shooter conventions with a set of flashy, delightful superpowers and a live-action component that's easy on the eyes. If you have an Xbox One, this is undoubtedly a game you should play.","Quantum Break is not the most revolutionary of games, and its cute time toys cover what is, at heart, a fairly standardized shooter. However, it carries itself with style and speed to create something genuinely fascinating to play, flavored by a story that, while failing to pay off in the final stretch, is more detailed and engrossing than most in its league.","If they dial back the gorgonzola, the product placement and adjust that cover mechanic, this could have been a perfect game...But, for now, you've got the best-looking game on Xbox One, jam-packed full of familiar faces and top-notch acting, complemented by strong gameplay mechanics and a popcorn-crunching TV series.","It is explosive, barely coherent, high-budget bluster. And, for the most part, is rather good fun.","I find myself in a quandary when thinking about Quantum Break because on one hand, it is an absolute success with how it is able to blend a TV show into a game, but on the other hand, it is a swing and a miss because of its gameplay shortcomings. Quantum Break is unlike any experience you are going to find in video games today, and for that reason, it absolutely deserves additional consideration...If you are more interested in Quantum Break for its gameplay, you may want to hold off until a sale or rental fits your budget, but if you are looking for something that takes a daring step forward with how a video game can be made, Quantum Break is perfect for you.","With great power should come interesting opposition, but in Quantum Break opponents are familiar busywork. First come the clueless bad guys with pop guns, then the smarter ones with high-powered rifles and grenades. Eventually the armored heavies lumber on set schlepping monster machine guns, followed by the spooky special forces with diet versions of your own abilities. Mix and match with scenarios where there’s a device that saps your powers, or the mini-boss has a weak spot on its back, or there’s a Braid-like puzzle you have to solve by slowing an object to open the way forward. It’s all perfectly competent and boringly idiomatic.","Like Alan Wake, Quantum Break isn't a flawless video game. But it's a proposition - a spectacular and beautiful narrative video game with some great action elements and a unique series within - that has to be considered and will certainly entertain many players.","A bold experiment in marrying passive and interactive elements to create a narrative game, Quantum Break almost succeeds. It looks utterly stunning, and it's fun to play, but overall the game doesn't quite gel with its TV show-style episodes to elevate its experience into something new. What we're left with is an enjoyable game and a half-decent TV show that coexist together, but don't feel like they're fundamentally entwined.","There are a lot of sound ideas in the middle of Quantum Break and, hey, if you're a sucker for goofy time travel hijinks this game has that going for it, too. But those ideas are the only things holding this project together. The moment you look past that heady connective tissue, every single one of Quantum Break's individual elements fall flat.",Remedy's experiment with Quantum Break mixing the game and the live action series simultaneously turns out to be a very interesting product. It's an entertaining super hero sci-fi action game with third person shooter elements.,"Quantum Break is not an Ocean. It’s a Lake. A Lake of experimentations, of narrative overlaps and tons of well crafted gameplay and stunning visual-technological achievements. And once again, through its multilayered story, the interaction between the live drama and the actual gameplay and the artistic script, Quantum Break is not a game for the throng. It’s a game for the ones that feel special enough to fully embrace it.","As good as the writing and acting are, Quantum Break is still a game and the game is rock solid.","Quantum Break is a solid TPS game with some original additions like supernatural powers and junction choices. It has some issues, like lack of enemy variety, irregular visual elements or too linear platforms. But it's fun and frantic most of the time.","Quantum Break is another example of Remedy Entertainment sticking to what they know, and doing it better than anyone else. An engrossing adventure with a captivating story. experimentation with new mediums for telling stories in games and refined third-person gameplay to match. Quantum Break isn’t optional, it’s essential.","The best part of Quantum Break is found in its narrative design. It's a unique way to tell a story, and it goes way beyond what videogames usually achieve, showing many different points of view and providing many ways to delve deep into the background. On the other hand, the gameplay suffers from occasional poor animations and scarce precision in the control system. Using time powers is fun most of the time, but the difficulty is set on the low side, the gunplay feels repetitive after a while, and the overall duration is below expectations. It will, despite this, please those who are looking for an intense narrative experience.","With its great storytelling and amazing production values, the few shooting parts of Quantum Break leave you with a sense of hunger.","The gameplay is excellent, the cutscenes are interesting, even the live-action stuff is surprisingly engaging. Everything about it works great individually, but everyone will absolutely notice that they're just that: individual parts. The overarching story connecting it all isn't enough to keep it from feeling disjointed...It's a disappointing realization, but not a damning one. Far from it, actually. Remedy's keen understanding of how to make an action title shines through, and it's every bit a game that has been lovingly crafted for years.","Quantum Break is a intriguing science-fiction tale told across two media platforms. While the action and exploration in the video game portions shine, the live-action episodes create a disconnect that is hard to recover from.","An exciting and visually spectacular shooter, weighed down by the inclusion of a terrible TV show. [May 2016, p.64]","Quantum Break is an enjoyable game with high replay value, but it underwhelms in several key areas.","As a game, Quantum Break is solid. There's a good balance between the shooting and exploration sections, and while some people may dislike the simplicity of the core shooting, the time-related powers augment it enough to make it fun. As a TV show, it does a good job of staying interesting without wearing out its welcome. As a whole, the story nicely melds together both pieces, and the different avenues the tale takes gives you a reason to replay it. Quantum Break is another excellent game from Remedy, and it belongs on the shelves of all adventure game fans.","While it doesn't always gel in a way that feels genuinely new, there are enough successful unfamiliar concepts here to make Quantum Break feel like a step forward for Remedy. [June 2016, p.100]","A brave attempt at cross medium entertainment, let down by leaning more one way than the other.","It doesn’t move at the breakneck pace of most games nowadays, nor does it ever seem particularly concerned to address some of the plot points or character gaps it leaves dangling, but those that take the chance on the full Quantum Break experience (episodes and all) will find a quirky and unique experience waiting that you just won’t see replicated anywhere else.","Quantum Break is all about one thing: storytelling. The game is dynamic, quick and has a terrific look and feel. Remedy has made a masterpiece.","This is a genuinely new experience, and I’m beyond glad that Remedy took this bizarre risk and made it. This is a game that feels special, new, and worth trying. I doubted this thing, I really did. But damn if it didn’t get me in the end.","An engaging and enjoyable narrative experience, and it makes the most of its stellar cast, pushing the boundaries of storytelling in games and presentation. However, it won’t be for everyone, particularly those who don’t like to be led by the hand or don’t want to spend an extended amount of time watching content rather than interacting with it. It also falsely makes you feel like you have a choice, but then, that’s much of its point, and despite a few missteps this is a story well worth experiencing.","The gameplay can get exciting at times, with the fast-paced gun battles and gorgeous abilities, but it’s clear that wasn’t the primary focus for this experience. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing – after all, I thoroughly enjoyed both of my playthroughs. However, if you were expecting battle after battle where you bend time to your will, you will be left wanting.","This kind of thing only works when you’re invested in the characters and plot, and with little emotional payoff, the branching narrative feels more like a fun gimmick than anything else...And despite its impressive vision, “gimmicky” is a pretty accurate description of Quantum Break. I give Remedy credit for having the stones to actually follow through on its promise of combining a TV show and a video game, and perhaps there’s indeed a future here. But in a world crammed to the gills with great shows and great games, an experience that does neither particularly well just isn’t worth your precious time.","In spite of a very good and immersive story, Quantum Break fails to hook the player with its old gameplay mechanics, the repetitive nature of the environments you go through and a very linear level design.","Quantum Break pushes the third-person genre through a star-studded cast and time-bending gameplay, although it lacks the replay value that many may have hoped for.","Quantum Break may fail as a transmedia project. The 4 real action episodes start well but they get worse in the end. On the other hand, Quantum Break does achieve what it promised as a game: a fun combat system with cool time powers, it's graphically awesome and it has a great story. Sure, it will get as many fans as haters but that's the price of trying to do new things.","Encounters – generally set in bland open areas – tend to be pretty similar to each other. Jack uses his time shifting abilities – which evolve in terms of range and power, but not sophistication – in the same ways on a limited variety of enemies time and again while relying on an awkward automatic covering system as he reloads or waits for his abilities to recharge. Rinse and repeat. There’s simply not enough variety.","What may seem like an ambitious project is in the fact the combination of a standard third-person shooter and the kind of cheap sci-fi drama you might find in the darkest corners of Sky TV. Visually tepid and filled with abortive gunfights and platforming, Quantum Break also struggles to contain its plot, while at the same time underselling its characters. Remedy's previous games have been characterised by a distinctive tone and knowing humour. By comparison Quantum Break is a glossy, charmless, wholly moderate outing.",,"Great narrative and phenomenal action aside, Quantum Break truly brings the cinematic experience into videogames. The many junction choices will make you come back for more, even after completing the game.","Quantum Break is a solid shooter but the game doesn't meet our hopes and expectations. Its story doesn't impress, and the story is rather short.","Despite some quite good late-in-the-story character beats, Quantum Break is still just another cautionary tale about time travel. It seems the one thing that never gets an alternate universe path is the notion that time is something that we should never mess with, which is kind of obvious by now. Perhaps this story could have bucked that trend. What saves Quantum Break, though, is the abundance of content and its integration of time-based abilities in combat. I might not have like the live-action episodes, but someone might especially when compared to narratives in other games.",,Spectacular action meets impressive real movie episodes: Quantum Breaks looks fantastic and tells a captivating story.,"As a marquee Microsoft-exclusive action title, Quantum Break delivers impressively on just about every front except that of content; it literally begs for a New Game Plus mode.","Remedy has crafted a fine game that blurs the line between interactive and sedentary entertainment. The ambition to combine the two into something that is more than just a novelty, but a new avenue into the way we play games is to be commended. A truly all-star cast deftly leads you on a well-scripted journey that you get to take control of, and the results speak for themselves.","All Quantum Break made me want to do is invent my own time machine to go back and un-play this title, so I could reclaim the nine hours I spent on it.",Quantum Break is a good exclusive for Xbox One. Probably won't be remembered for any innovation or marvelous feature but it's fun and can entertain the player from the start to finish.,"Worth the long wait, Remedy has delivered one of the most beautiful games on Xbox with tight gameplay and deep storytelling that will fool you over and over again.","Undeniably ambitious, Remedy's game certainly feels unique in many ways, but perhaps not in the ways that truly matter.","Whether you consider Quantum Break a game with episodes, or a mini-series with interactive segments ultimately doesn’t matter - it’s an experience. It may use an unproven formula, but that blueprint is also the main attraction that piques one’s curiosity, even if my own started to waiver amidst a story too interested in its own keywords to talk about anything more depth-inducing. With a dire need to be amongst the blockbusters, it’s an inoffensive, non-threatening tale with big-name actors who try so seriously to make it otherwise. And while not an one interesting story in itself, Quantum Break has an interesting way of being told.",Telling a story inside and outside the game was a risk that ultimately paid off. The result is certainly satisfying. Quantum Break is something special: the best TV show you can play and the best game you can ever watch like a TV show. Remedy delivers once again.,Quantum Break’s tv-series is mildy fun at its best but in the end it is the gameplay that makes you want to experience this title. The spectacular shoot-outs deliver.,"Underneath all the visual fireworks and impressive design Quantum Break is just a pretty good shooter with super powers. Some fights are great, but many enemies are plain dumb.","Quantum Break’s story and visual prowess are reason enough to recommend this game to anyone looking for a rote shooter with a more-than-usual focus on compelling narrative. The best I can say about the action sequences is that they’re tolerable en route to uncovering the game’s core of science-fueled existential crises. So while I feel comfortable recommending this ultimately uneven adventure, in a gaming world where we’ve already played so many super-charged, inFamous-styled action games, I feel pretty disappointed by “just good enough"" for QB's action portions.","Quantum Break is a game I was constantly trying to fall in love with, but it just didn't allow me to take the full plunge. I don't know if I want to experience another hybrid form of entertainment like this again, but I also don't want games to play it safe.","The idea of having a feature-length live action mini-movie peppered throughout is undeniably ambitious. Yet the game frequently struggles to stand out; it doesn't stick the landing on its most ambitious pieces. Outside of the fantastic, time-bending visuals, the story and combat are merely fine, and the live action elements are nothing short of a chore to get through. It's a shame, as these sort of game releases are a rarity, with safer, more familiar sequels becoming the order of the day.","What saves this radical concept from total disaster is the fact that the live-action segments are well-acted and tightly paced. They look and feel exactly like… well, like a mid-season replacement on the USA Network, if we’re being honest. But the action is just intriguing enough that you won’t mind being asked to watch a 20-minute cut scene before beginning the next level...Once you get over the novelty, Quantum Break shakes out as a mediocre shooter with a lavish budget. It will be remembered for blending game and live-action in a formula that actually kinda worked, not for its gameplay, which feels unambitious, half-baked.",,,,,"It is apparent from the first minute to the last that an epic narrative is the primary focus in Quantum Break. From the full-length live action film to the extensive emails and documents, the game beckons you to savor the internal drama and cataclysmic storyline. If you're more interested in skipping to the action, you'll likely be disappointed with the remedial difficulty and generic shooter structure.",,"Quantum Break is an incredible game that will hook you for its ten hour duration and stay with you long after that. The story is packed with mystery, suspense, and engaging characters caught in a high stakes situation where every decision is significant. While adding TV show may not have revolutionized storytelling, Quantum Break is a must play game for those looking to sink their teeth into a meaningful adventure.",,"The story is quite elaborate, the human character animations are outstanding, the performances are great, and there are some real moving moments in the game",,"Time paradoxes are always a slippery slope, but Remedy manages to play with them without getting entangled in some quirky and frail plot twist. Unexpectedly, the union between videogame and TV works great; the same cannot be said for the shooting sequences, with some design flaws that can ruin a generally more than enjoyable experience. If you own an Xbox One, Quantum Break should be a part of your collection.",,"If you extensively use time powers, battles will be quick and colorful – but Quantum Break doesn’t actually encourage that playstyle. Even on the highest difficulty, only one enemy type requires you to teleport around; everyone else can be killed with standard cover shooter routines. What’s even worse is that there’s a considerable lag between the button press and actual use of the ability, which further discourages playing fast and loose. [Issue#208, p.68]",,,,,,"If Quantum Break is a game fractured between two worlds, the one reality set for us as players is the one in which it's a shooter that often isn't a shooter, and a story that doesn't fully explore its narrative potential. It has intriguing ideas regarding both, but in this case, two halves don't really make a whole.",,,,,,,,"Quantum Break is like a breath of fresh air. Truth be told, the ""TV show"" mixed with the game isn't that great, but the story itself (really cool) and interesting characters (really well played by real actors) are something else. Plus the shooting - even though not as important - looks quite unique. Remedy's newest game is an excellent product for gamers who have grown tired of sandboxes and multiplayer games.","Remedy’s newest action-adventure is ambitious, looks gorgeous and has great action, but the story doesn’t quite live up to its potential. [Apr 2016]","The addition of a series in which we are told some parts of the story is a risky experiment but in this case it has proven to be a success. With Quantum Break we face a game with an impressive narrative and loads of action for fans of the genre, but it also has some weak aspects such as the duration of the game and false decision-making.","By itself, Quantum Break wouldn’t have been as successful as it is. The gameplay is not strong enough to stand alone. But in collaboration with the TV series, the stunning cast, the script, the set and character design all work so well together that it elevates Quantum Break for just an interactive experience to an interactive collective.","Quantum Break is a bold and brave game that dares to be different. With a fascinating story and exhilarating gameplay, Remedy has created another fantastic game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,The game's stronger than expected writing and decent cast more than make up for the conceptual banalities.,,,"Despite how pedestrian some aspects of the game may be, I concluded Quantum Break feeling like something new had happened. Something special had happened that more than compensated for some of the flatness of the story and the mostly rote gunplay. A game simply never worked like this before, nor has a TV show. Because of that, what might have otherwise been ordinary feels extraordinary.",,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed Quantum Break in the same way I enjoy Marvel superhero movies. They’re fun to watch while I kick back and eat some popcorn. But when I go to see The Avengers I don’t have a control pad in my hands, and there’s where Quantum Break gets confusing for me. Sussing out the relative importance of the two halves of Quantum Break messed with my head as much as trying to sort through all the story’s causality loops.","Quantum Break has its own beauty with its TV Show. If we are talking about storytelling, Remedy nails it. Apart from that, Quantum Break is a technical disaster with bad gameplay mechanics and old fashion visuals.",,,,,,,,,,"Remedy has, without a doubt, crafted a very creative title with Quantum Break. It’s not going to be the killer exclusive game that so many were looking for with the Xbox One, but it’s definitely been worth the wait. Story gamers will especially delight in replaying the game multiple times to see the various episodes and experience the different paths the game itself can take. For anyone with an Xbox One, Quantum Break is a must-own.",,,,,,,,"Jack’s time-based superpowers are a ton of fun to use in combat, but environmental puzzles and platforming sequences, such as a cargo ship caught in a looping time stutter after plowing into a bridge, feel like they’ve been shoehorned in simply to give players something to do between firefights.",,,,,"Quantum Break is a dual experience - on one side is its great and interesting story with many interesting ideas, but on the other is mediocre gameplay. At the end, this is a game worth playing, especially if you're a completionist, but not a journey you'd be willing to take once more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-council---episode-3-ripples,,,,,,"It’s a shame to see that issues with the framerate and the daft character animations are still yet to be resolved, however, with that in mind, Ripples presents the best and most balanced episode in the series so far. I’ll credit the voice acting too, which sees a notable improvement throughout. The mansion is as stunning as always and the story that’s set within remains intriguing, exciting and fairly well paced.","In the previous episode, The Council proved to be more than a one-episode wonder. Now it's shown it can even avoid the dreaded middle episode slump that so often befalls episodic games such as this. With a huge plot twist, the story is beginning to take on a whole different shape. Meanwhile, smart RPG-infused conversations and more interesting branching paths keep it all well worth another trip to the mansion.",,,"Ripples delivers the world of corruption, politics and power made by Big Bad Wolf. Puzzles and Confrontations are more intense and complicated and their consequences way more serious than previous episodes. Despite its technical issues, Ripples brings us more challenges and a better story that keeps growing up.",,,,"There may not be many new locations to discover, but the expansion of the story and the writing is, once again, top notch. It makes it all the better that the development team have managed to drop plenty of hints and huge expectations for what will occur as the episodes begin to conclude.",,,,,,"The cliffhanger, on the other hand, is perhaps the best so far – at least, in the way my game ended, it was – and episode four is set up to be the darkest and most twisted yet. I can’t wait.",,,,,,,"With its third episode, The Council is touching greatness. Many decisive choices and revelations, more freedom… It’s a shame the framerate is so bouncy, to say the least, but Big Bad Wolf is proving itself with Ripples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Episode 3: Ripples provides the most harrowing story yet, as it greatly lifts the stakes in terms of life and death. While this started off as a meeting amongst political world leaders, it is clearly becoming apparent that there is a lot more in play than what it seems, and Louis does not know who he should trust, or even who is telling the truth. Unfortunately, the episode is plagued with glitches - one that can't be solved except for reloading the game - coupled with the choppy graphics and popping audio portions of the game that ruins what is otherwise the best story-driven episode of The Council yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s almost as if a kind of cryptography has been applied to all of the creatures, puzzles, and environments, except instead of being protected by hundreds of lines of code they are designed with a failsafe that is human intuition. It would be easy for someone to say that Omno does nothing new, but the reason it’s easy to say that is because it’s completely incorrect. Omno has plenty of imaginative and ingenious ideas - they’re just unfortunately hampered by more established ones that didn’t need to be there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Omno will provide most players with three or four pleasant hours.

That’s the joy of Game Pass, though. When considering what to spend your money on, a few pleasant hours may or may not be enough. For those who can play it for no extra cost however, that makes this an easy game to check out. Players on other platforms may need to think about whether this is the right title for them, but Game Pass subscribers should give Omno a chance. I think you’ll be happy you did so.",

There are some flawed aspects, particularly the length of the campaign mode. Perhaps arcade mode could have been truncated slightly. As it is, many of the stages run a little too long. Thankfully, it never gets to the point where boredom starts to set in.

And most importantly, it still plays great. Little refinements throughout yield small but noticeable improvements on the experience.","The game has been refined with loads of changes for both pros and novices, and the number of modes present, along with their depth, will ensure that this stays in rotation until the hockey season starts.

The graphics are definitely not everyone’s cup of tea, but deliver more that works where it counts even if some animation and character model work would have helped the overall presentation a bit.

The imagining of 1940s Los Angeles is massive and detailed, and every aspect of the game feels meticulous and polished. The well-woven story edges out any gameplay complaints or issues that arose in the original game. All the DLC and additional challenges are here — albeit some of it has been inserted less than tactfully — making the Xbox One version a nice compilation for players who missed this gem from last gen, but the value drops significantly for returning players, partially due to L.A. Noire's engaging and memorable mystery. The appeal is snuffed out when you already know how every twist and turn in this detective tale goes, and Rockstar hasn't brought out enough meaningful changes to make L.A.

It’s a game worth playing for the story and setting, but not for the detective work involved.",,"L.A. Noire was a unique game that deserved a second chance. My biggest hurdle in recommending this version though is the price.

The plentiful tweaks to gameplay and AI, along with worthwhile new features spread across all primary modes, accumulate to make FIFA 21 a must-have for football fans. And if they’re planning on picking up a next-gen console in the near-future, there’s possibly even more for them to look forward to.","FIFA 21 has something for everyone, from casual gamers to passionate soccer fans. Sure, FIFA games can sometimes feel repetitive, and there are some things that need to be addressed, but when you play you can tell that the developers are keyed-in on the same things that make real soccer fans passionate.

New tweaks to off-the-balls runs and passing are welcome, headers are viable options once again and keepers have been nerfed to the point that all-manner of long-range efforts, vicious volleys and fancy finished shots are back in vogue. Volta still feels like a bit of an afterthought - with its new Debut story mode as cheesy as you might have been expecting - but a slick new simulation option in Career mode, alongside that smart player customisation system and customisable stadiums and co-op Rivals and Squad Battles in Ultimate Team, mean there's just about enough here for diehard fans to justify splashing out once again. This is, for all its faults and foibles, a comprehensive and undeniably fun swansong for EA's behemoth on this current generation of consoles.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Like many of the sports games I’ve reviewed this year, FIFA 21 is a very small step forward for the franchise. The on-pitch action has never been better and although I think career mode could use a lot more love and attention, the moment-to-moment gameplay is still as compelling as ever. It’s just a very difficult game to recommend if you have FIFA 20 and that’s really what it comes down to. If you have last year’s game, you really don’t need to go to FIFA 21 but if you missed it for whatever reason, then this is a great game to jump back into.",,"It took an entire generation, but I am delighted to see Career mode finally have its moment in the spotlight in FIFA 21.

The game doesn’t quite look or feel quite on par with modern racing games, but it has always been in a lane of its own and still offers an undeniable sense of speed and satisfaction in the gameplay. The remastered edition also includes all the additional DLC content and some new achievements, so there’s a decent value proposition here too. If you’re sitting on the fence, my advice is to get it while it’s hot. There’s an online fervour building for this game that you won’t want to miss.",,,,"Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered keeps all the traits of the simple and immediate original arcade racer, but it can feel a bit too simple for modern gamers. Technically it's a very good porting though, and if you aren't looking for a too deep or varied experience, it can still be very enjoyable.","Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit was a good game that allowed us to remember the foundation of the saga classics . But Criterion offers a Burnout style game that works quite well. Now, with a need for new games that provide an experience that fans deserve, appears the remastered edition of this game. And it works well, especially on Xbox One X, with the performance mode and the 60fps that gives a really fast experience. But we can't ignore that this game is ten-year-old game. improved resolution, some new effects and, most importantly, new stages and races, rejuvenates this classic arcade racing experience.",,,,"If you have ever wanted to smash police cars/racers off the road then Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered on Xbox is the game for you, and that goes double if you've never played it before. It’s fast, furious and will have you on the edge of your seat as you hurtle round corners, inches from disaster, winning a race by the skin of your teeth. If you played the original then there’s not a lot new here, but it looks and plays great - that in itself means it’s got to be worth a punt.",,,,,"Need for Speed Hot Pursuit returns in better shape than ever, rewarding the excellent job done by Stellar Entertainment.","If you fondly remember Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit from back in the day and fancy another crack at it, this remaster won’t disappoint one bit. And if you’ve never played it before and fancy a racing experience that’s a little more old-fashioned and focused, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered should be considered a must-have. One of the best Need for Speed games ever made has been on the receiving end of the remaster treatment, making its cops versus racers gameplay more enjoyable and stunning to look at than ever. What’s not to love about that?",,"Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered is the perfect game to bring back. It harkens back to a time when racing games were simple and fun. I hope the Criterion team manages to get back to this formula. This was the last NFS game I enjoyed all around and have somewhat forgotten about the series since its release. It seems EA knows this considering this is the title they chose to remaster. For those that thirst for the classic days of the Need for Speed series, this is a solid title to add to your collection.",,,,"There's a reason EA singled out Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit for the remaster treatment – it's still great. Throw in all the DLC, all of the features the original had, and a litany of impressive visual enhancements, and Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered is most definitely a racer worth returning to. And if it's your first time, well, lucky you.","Ten after its initial release, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit is still a really good game, and the few improvements Stellar Entertainment has brought to refresh it a bit. Nervous, easy to learn and rather dense thanks to the addition of DLC, the title fits without much difficulty in a market where purely arcade racing games are rare, despite an aging general structure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Against all odds (read: some big-name racing games that eventually turned out disappointing), Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered is the racing game to get this holiday season. It’s pure video gaming at its best with no extra thrills or frills other than serious pedal to the metal racing. It wisely focuses on what it does best and therefore drives to the finish line as a winner. The remaster doesn’t change the successful formula, only polishes it to meet the modern standards.",,,,,,"Some games age better than others, and this is the case of Need for Speed Hot Pursuit: this new version shows an Autolog that still works and the fun in the pursuits is still there. There is some visual glitch, but overall, this remaster is perfect for anybody who never tried one of the best game in the series.","Hot Pursuit’s core has aged very well, although not everything around it has. Even with its flaws, this is a solid racing game that we recommend to everyone who misses simpler times, when games didn’t need filler content to be greenlighted.",,,,,,,"Overall, Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered may very well be the best Need For Speed game on modern hardware. There’s something about the more focused menu-centric system in place here that makes it more fun to go back and forth between racing and police action, and the retooled graphics and sound do a lot to help make the game more intense than ever before. If you enjoyed the game the first time around, it’s better now and feels more modern than one would expect for something that isn’t a ground-up remake. For anyone who missed it, you can now enjoy a better-looking, better-sounding, and better-playing version of one of the best racing games of the past decade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit has aged wonderfully. Ten years have not been enough for this work to begin to show some seams, because both in the playable side and in the design structure of its challenges it is still intact. The remastering work is minimal, only technical, and we miss a greater effort to improve some textures, the fluidity of the images or the models, which do not stand out excessively. Luckily, on the playable level it is still excellent in almost all its sections, the Autolog is a sensational idea and there are always reasons to return: wasted content. Hot Pursuit is back in 2020 to remind us just how good it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered is the perfect reminder of what Criterion brought to the franchise, with a blisteringly fast arcade racer that’s made all the better if you’ve got the ability to play it at 60fps. The main downside is that your Autolog wall is more likely to splashed with your solitary achievements, rather than the consistent flow of competition you experienced a decade ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite having high hopes for Hot Pursuit's new remastered version, I found it to be just another mediocre Need for Speed game, using the name of the veteran series, without actually living up to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A cracking example of nostalgia done right, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered is as worthy as any current-gen racer out there. It’s not easy to begin with, but once you’re practiced you’ll be flying across the finish line.",,,Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered offers slight technical improvements and 6 hours of content compared to the game 10 years ago.

ruiner,,,,,,,"Ruiner is a whirlwind of shooting, dodging and dying that falls just shy of true greatness. The shaded cyberpunk environments are depressing but beautiful, inviting you into a seedy criminal world where challenging enemies and badass weapons abound. Death is always one misstep away; you'll come to embrace it and take it in stride as you figure out what makes every opponent tick. However, by halfway through Ruiner, you'll have seen all there is to see, as much of the late game encounters are lazy copy-pastes of enemies and bosses from earlier in the game. While it's cool there is a skill tree and perks to upgrade, some of them aren't worth investing into, and it feels like the developers try to push you down a specific leveling path with the way the encounters are set up. The frenetic, fast-paced combat is still a blast, especially if cyberpunk themes are your jam, and the opening levels of Ruiner are some of the best gaming experiences to be had in a while.",,"RUINER pleases with its detailed, even if not so original, cyberpunk world and frantic action. Sometimes fights can become too chaotic and the story could have been better explained, but it'll definitely please lovers of action games and dark sci-fi settings.",,"The technological cadence of a near future full of violence is the context in which Ruiner takes us. A zenithal-view action game that surprises us with its technical section, its frenetic shootings and its variety of weapons.","With so many twin-stick shooters on the market, they often tend to blend together. Ruiner stands at the top of the field, thanks in large part to its ultra-cool presentation. The visuals and sounds are amazingly slick for an indie game, the sci-fi story and setting evoke the best cyberpunk stories like Ghost in the Shell and Blade Runner, and the gameplay has more depth than your average shooter. If you can handle some serious challenge (and a whole lot of the color red), Ruiner certainly won't ruin your day.",,,,,,,,,,"The second outing feels like the balance the game should have had, and it is a lot more fun. For players willing to suffer through it once, it almost makes up for the tedium. The problem arises once again in that there are so many games out there that work on the first try. Maybe the developers will patch out the issues, and if so Ruiner is a great idea with some truly questionable mechanics that make it a chore to play more often than it should.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"On a pure gameplay level, Ruiner is almost perfect. It strikes the perfect balance between challenge and fun. The game feels incredible to play, and every ability feels satisfying and powerful, but that means nothing if you don't have the skills to use them well. The story and world may not be fleshed out enough, but at least it's a sight to behold. The game may be called Ruiner, but it can only improve your game library.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Competent, but not wholly compelling.

Those are positive strides, but the rest of the modes and features are starting to feel too familiar. If you're someone who's been following the NHL series for years, you aren't getting anything drastically new here to alter the balance or restore excitement. The EASHL is still enjoyable with a great group of buddies, and the other offline modes are decent, but this series is in need of some new approaches to gameplay and refreshes of older modes.",Threes is definitely the star of the show in NHL 18 with only marginal improvements made to the rest of the franchise's modes.,,,,"NHL 18 will satisfy hockey fans; that goes without saying. Its real achievement though is in its design, which will seamlessly teach and assist a player who knows nothing about hockey. They’re likely to stick around too, because as it turns out, hockey is a blast in videogame form.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Although EA Vancouver planned a three-year rejuvenation of their hockey series, NHL 18 seems like it’s on the downside of generational sports games. While Threes adds some zest and significant features, that’s the only notable addition to the game. When the introduction menu pops up and What’s New offers only three choices (one being a tutorial), 2017 is not a good year.

New modes and options like NHL Threes, 3-on-3 hockey in EASHL, or creating the 32nd franchise in the NHL are fun additions that give the series a serious shot in the arm. Some minor issues from previous games continue to crop up, and I wish the customization options were deeper, but overall NHL 18 is a must have for any hockey fan.",,,"NHL 18 finds itself in a strange spot. On the one hand, there are significant changes to the gameplay modes and basic stick handling. This is especially true of Threes mode, which could've become a stand-alone, downloadable game due to the amount of content it possesses. On the other hand, the AI is flaky and undermines quite a few modes, especially Hockey Ultimate Team. NHL 18 remains a fun title and a good choice for those who are interested in the series but don't want a semi-arcade hockey mode.",,,,,"NHL 18 is another strong entry from an underrated sports gaming franchise. EA has delivered a more rewarding franchise mode, added new ways to play, while at the minimum, sustaining itself in other modes. That's a formula for success, but the lack of progress in customization, single-player modes and presentation keep it from being a monumental step for the franchise.",,,,,,,,,,,"The new NHL Threes mode is fun and takes up a lot of time without getting boring.

With that said, NHL 18 is still the most innovative hockey game to date, and regardless of your level of experience with the franchise, it will leave you wanting more, coming back for more fun time and time again.","Though NHL 18 is a solid, enjoyable title that will likely appeal to old and new hockey game fans alike, there’s little innovation on display — the developers only deliver minor improvements and necessary tweaks. In order to make the series relevant again, EA needs to find a way to revolutionize the gameplay. It pains me to say, but it’s not 1994 anymore and expectations have changed.

darksiders-genesis,,,,,,"Darksiders: Genesis redeems the series after the disappointment of the 3rd entry last year. It manages to capture the essence that makes Darksiders what it is, while transposing it in to a new genre. Top quality action, over the top powers and spectacle and a fun core loop that provides challenge without too much frustration. Removing the series staple platforming wouldn’t have hurt, and at times solo play can be a little bit attritional, but overall you’d be hard pressed not to have a good time with Genesis.",,,"Darksiders: Genesis delivers a varied and entertaining action-RPG experience, with good gameplay and longevity.

It’s true that this is a more linear experience this time around, but none of what made Darksiders a cult hit in the first place has been sacrificed in translation.",,,,,,,,"The Darksiders universe has always been an intriguing one, filled with larger-than-life characters, a deep, if not slightly confusing storyline and a glorious aesthetic that seems to come straight off of a 70’s prog-metal album cover. Genesis may position itself as merely a side story; just a small alternative look at one part of this universe. But it is so much more than that. It offers a more personal story and one that may seem insignificant at first, but has wider implications to the story as a whole. Tied to that is gameplay that is both fun and chaotic in equal measure and offers replay value to those who want to go back again and again.",,,,"Darksiders: Genesis is a neat concept with a frankly bizarre execution. While the isometric viewpoint is cool during certain scenarios – namely Strife’s twin-stick shooter gameplay – everything else doesn’t really fit, especially the awful platforming.

If you're thinking it's simply Diablo with a Darksiders skin you're going to be disappointed. Darksiders Genesis is a cheap Diablo knockoff that doesn't provide the same spectacle that made the previous 3 games the iconic status that they are. Despite all of that though, I LOVE DARKSIDERS GENESIS. Yes I'll tolerate the worst map ever, a camera and movement system that makes me want to hunt down the developers and deal with all the problems of level design and boss development, because I enjoyed playing the hell out of it. A game doesn't have to be perfect to be fun and Darksiders Genesis proves that to be true.",Darksiders Genesis isn’t a bad game. It has a lot of potential to it and there are some things it does well. I especially liked the twists to its story. The problem is that it is pretty clear it didn’t get the same level of attention as its predecessors. Elements of its design makes it feel like corners were cut in an effort to get things done as efficiently as possible.

Quality of life improvements such as skipping repeated scenes on later playthroughs and hiding useless menu options would be appreciated, but on the other hand, the game’s narrative is so engaging that I was tempted to take notes in order to keep all of the characters’ stories straight. Finding flaws in alibis, spotting discrepancies in statements, and slowly getting to learn about each character’s backstory were the main highlights of the game, and they manage to overshadow the less appealing aspects of this sleuthing experience.",,,,The Shapeshifting Detective will bring you some intrigue and mystery while you try to guess who is the murderer of Dorotha Shaw. A unique FMV adventure.,,,In respect to the murder mystery theme and The Shapeshifting Detective is a shining light in immersive story-telling. It may lack in gameplay variety but the shapeshifting mechanic and how it is integrated into the story really sets it apart.,,,,,,"It’s hard not to be charmed by The Shapeshifting Detective. From its presentation – with an eerie local radio station playing spooky stories in the background – to its alluring characters and enthralling narrative that dances with supernatural themes, there’s a lot to love.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With multiple endings, you steer your mystery taking uncertain turns in the hope they lead you in the right direction. The unique shapeshifting mechanic is absolutely genius. The flow of the scenes is done quite well, with the only hiccup being the time you felt was wasted from showing up at empty rooms. You may feel content with your ending but may also have that itch to try again to see all of the possible outcomes. I don’t tend to watch movies more than once, but one that changes constantly in a video game format is something I can definitely get on board with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No matter if you’re looking for a goofy FMV good time or an engaging mystery to solve, The Shapeshifting Detective delivers. You can see where the corners were cut if you push too hard in the wrong places, but the story and characters drive the game past those shortcomings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, The Shapeshifting Detective is well worth its price. I feel like I've said this before, but the actors, the story, and the gameplay are the key elements. Without one, the others would suffer. D'Avekki Studios and Wales Interactive should be proud. Once again, they have blown me away, and now I'm sitting here wondering when the next game is coming. I don't usually get attached to games, but when studios make a genuine effort in hiring quality actors, creating an outstanding environment, and think about the player's experience, I can't ignore that. The Shapeshifting Detective has several avenues in regards to how the story could end. I've already played a few times to see this!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wales Interactive deliver a game that excels in taking the player into a mysterious and unsettling place rife with oddball characters, creepy radio stations and untimely death.

embers-of-mirrim,,,,,,,"The challenging gameplay is balanced out by the nice variety of puzzles to solve, none of which are very difficult. The graphics are beautifully done and the wordless story is intriguing. Add in the relative ease of the achievement list, and you have a game that many will enjoy despite the frustration levels for those of us less than adept with a dual-stick system. Some may find the $19.99 price tag a bit steep for a title that can be finished quickly, in which case waiting for a sale might be in order.",,"An interesting gameplay mechanic differentiates Embers of Mirrim from the usual side-scrolling platformer crop, asking us to control two spirits with one thumbstick each.

Levels full of obstacles and charm will delight the genre fans with a modest but accomplished graphics.,"Embers of Mirrin delivers the best of platforming games and puzzle games in a single fun package. With brain teasing puzzles, platform jumping action, and gorgeous graphics, this game is great for anyone who wants a platformer built for current consoles.",,"If you’re looking for something that combines both the platforming and puzzling world, whilst trying something a little different, Embers of Mirrim is for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Although Embers of Mirrim doesn't last long, it has some unique ideas and stays entertaining throughout. The controls for both Mirrim and the embers are functionally solid. The most clever moments tend to unexpected, such as when trying to move the embers in different directions. Dodging minions and navigating a twisting passageway becomes quite a bit more interesting when it requires controlling two heroes at the same time. While the lack of replay-value is a shame, this is still an adventure worth experiencing.",,,,"The combination of platforming and puzzles are quite solid in this interesting title, easily recommendable for fans of the genre, even though if falls shorts in some aspects like difficulty and length.",,,,"Overall, if you’ve got a thirst for some puzzle platformer fun, Embers of Mirrim is a well-made title which may lose you when it comes down to its story and visual appeal.

We're stoked for the next instalment.",,,,,,,What D4 does incredibly well is provide gamers who loved Deadly Premonition with another tale of weird and wonder while at the same time giving day one Xbox One owners a reason to use their Kinect rather than controlling their cable TV.,"Don’t be fooled by the overly bizarre characters: with its surprisingly deep and compelling story and tight controls both via standard controller and Kinect, D4 will leave you begging for more episodes. A great new adventure game, definitely worth buying.",,,,,,,,"D4 is an intriguing experience, and brimming with personality. It’s also the most polished game from Access to date, with a genuinely first-rate presentation.",,,,,,,,,,,,"D4 is insanity distilled into adventure-game form, more self-consciously wacky than another Swery game, Deadly Premonition, but more human, too.",,,,,"I love a game that can surprise me, show me something I've never seen, so the chance to experience something completely otherworldly in a game is really difficult to pass up. If you feel the same way, maybe you'll be willing to push through some of the cruft to get to the delightfully weird bits of Swery65's latest.","D4 has some problems, but it’s absolutely worth a play if you’re after a game unlike anything else on the Xbox One. Bloody crazy, but charming as well.","There are gameplay elements that miss their mark, and the pacing isn't perfect, but it's not enough to kill these dark dreams dead. Someone tell SWERY that we're ready for more.",,,,,At first it may remind you of the latest Telltale adventures. But in the end this mystery thriller is more like an interactive David Lynch movie to which Quentin Tarantino and Abel Ferrara wrote the script. And yes: It is fun to play – even with the spot-on Kinect controls.,,"Minor issues and short playtime aside, D4 is well worth a look, and one of the few times the “better with Kinect” slogan is appropriate.","From its insanely quirky characters to its underlying tragedy, D4: Dark Dreams Don’t Die is oddity done right.",,"The narrative hooks are numerous and capable of sinking in nice and deep. I can’t wait to see where this crazy tale goes next in the forthcoming episodes. Hopefully less of my time is spent on needless action, and more of it is focused on the case and characters.","A worthy follow-up to Deadly Premonition, although whether it earns the same classic status will depend largely on the subsequent episodes.",,,,,Fans of Swery65 and Deadly Premonition will be in heaven while playing D4 since Swery's outrageous story and characters are even more outrageous this time.,,A weird and intriguing adventure which manages to make good use of Kinect and is filled with pure Japanese madness.,"It is far from perfect, but we prefer an imperfect game full of personality over a ""perfect"" generic one. If you like Telltale style, but in a bizarre, Japanese way, then go for it.",,,,,,,,,,,"D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die may just be the beginning, but it is easily one of the most delightfully bizarre trips of the year. It won't always make sense, but there is a consistent earnestness to its oddity that somehow makes it all work in harmony of '80s saxophone riffs and overly-affected Boston accents.",,,,"D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die only features the first season (2 episodes) of the whole story. This is quite short for the price, but the story and the atmosphere are really attractive and catchy so far.","Once again, SWERY injects a detective story with his patented brand of weirdness, though this time he's finally free of the technical limitations that hampered his past work. D4 isn't a flawless experience, but, as with Deadly Premonition, it offers a world and set of characters you won't want to leave behind.","D4 isn't what I'd easily call a good game, but it's a good enough one built around such magnificently strange material that I have zero qualms about recommending it to just about anyone. I guarantee half the people I'd recommend it to will find it impenetrably weird, but that other half will adore what Swery and his team have constructed, and hopefully will continue constructing, in D4.",,,,"D4 is Swery65 after all. Great and insane characters, intriguing plot and good Kinect gameplay. However, the game has some graphical issues.","D4 is a darkly weird game, and one that boasts a fair amount of polish as it experiments with genres and controls. It’s not for everyone, but the solid Kinect input and trademark Japanese madness make for one deep dive that you won’t soon forget.","D4 is disorienting, surreal, crazy as the previous works from Swery65. Is a brilliant adventure with a lot of hyperbolic characters and exaggerate situations. Play it and you won't regret it.","D4 hasn't a big talent, but it has a strong personality. If you want to try something different, the latest Swery videogame is definitely a good choice. It's not for everyone, but maybe it could be for you.","D4 has me intrigued, mostly because I felt a genuine attachment to the characters. I want to see this journey through to the end, and the classic Swery wackiness kept me interested throughout the relatively familiar adventure genre gameplay.",,,,"D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die may be a short game, but it takes strides to be memorable.","It would be a pity if this erratic, wonderfully offbeat adventure ended here.

[Issue#154, p.124]",,,,,,,,,,,"It is not easy to appreciate D4 in its entirety, especially due to the Japanese surrealism it contains, sometimes extremely difficult to understand. At the same time, what you will find is a fine game that is able to provide a unique experience.",,,"D4 is a game that knows what it is. It’s quirky and odd with an outrageous story and over-the-top characters, and that may not sit well with some people, but that’s the kind of game Swery is known to make.",,,,,"To be clear, I wasn't expecting a complete game from D4—the episodic model guarantees a certain amount of waiting around on the part of the consumer—but this doesn't even feel like a complete episode.","Maybe it's not a game for all the audiences and actually it's not even a complete product, but just this beginning is worth the price of the ticket for this new ride in Swery's world of weirdness.",,"There is a real richness of content and back-story that has been invented, and despite the feeling that you don’t really make much progress in solving the case in question, I really wanted to press on and find out what was going on.","The characters are quirky yet interesting, and I’m looking forward to returning to their world. If you’re willing to give decent motion controls a shot, and like the idea of a bizarre private eye anime, I would say that D4: Dark Dreams Don’t Die - Season One is well worth the investment.",,,"D4 is a greatly absurd adventure that thrives on its colorful characters and downright bizarre dialogues. When you’ve grown tired of serious adventure games like The Walking Dead and you want some humour in your life, D4 is good company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"D4 is a silly and frivolous game, but charming in its awkwardness. Part of the charm lies in the fact that it blends the absurd and serious things in equal proportions, so absurd ones look even more grotesque while serious ones suddenly became more meaningful. The selected method of narration with trips in time and space is able to reveal the most non-standard locations, and the author's story can go in an absolutely incredible jungle. [Nov 2014, p.94]",,,,,,"D4 is bizarre. There's no other game out there where you'll find someone playfully tossing a rat in your mouth or strutting around with their lover that also happens to be a mannequin. But underneath all of those quirky story beats is an intriguing mystery, bolstered by a solid use of Kinect.",,,,,,,,,"It probably would be more intuitive to play an adventure game with a steering wheel and pedals, when compared to the controls that D4 brings to the table. On top of that, the game is crippled with a stupid hunger minigame, that requires you to hunt food, or else you run out of stamina. The story is quite compelling and the wacky characters try their best to keep the game afloat, but the controls and the core mechanics just aren’t up for the task. [Feb 2015]",,,"As gamers we are taught that games should fit different formulas, game characters should be certain types, and stories should be told in certain ways.

For others, there is a redemptive quality to this finale, enough to make me glad I played all the way through to the end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sometimes inconsistent, other times explosive, Telltale has managed to create a Batman who is more than just the sum of his fists and gadgets.

The wildly random characters and story line are very interesting and gripping and if you enjoy smashing slews of enemies with quirky comedic moves then you will enjoy yourselves here. The format can become quite repetitive after a while, but I feel there is enough variety in characters, moves and enemies along with the fun story line to make this a good game.",,,"One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 doesn't revolutionize the series' formula but introduces many small improvements while avoiding the ""cut and paste"" effect. If you love mousou games and One Piece, this will be a satisfying experience.",,One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 will allow us to relive the most important points of the adventure and draw some tears while we are playing.,,,"One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 is a real blast as it injects the madcap abilities and personas of the One Piece universe into the Musou style of gameplay that the Warriors games are known for. Sure, the objectives themselves are quite bland, but the action itself is a hell of a lot of fun thanks to the varied roster possessing devastating moves.",,,,,,"It’s clear to see that One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 is one of the best and most enjoyable games based on the hit One Piece franchise. It has a terrific roster of characters that are brought to life like never before, its story is ridiculously entertaining, there’s plenty of content, and the action has been tweaked in ways that make it feel surprisingly fresh. Whether you’re a fan of Warriors games or One Piece, One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 is easy to recommend.","One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 introduces some great fighting mechanics, overhauled systems from previous iterations, and smoother and more rewarding gameplay to the franchise. While it doesn’t do anything new to uplift the Musou genre of games, it’s a good game to pick up and beat the crap out of pirates as Luffy tries to become the king of the pirates.",,,,,,Quotation forthcoming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 is one of the best Musou games that I have played (for the ones based off anime). I'm not a fan of One Piece, but this game is really good and I think all Warriors fans should give it a try. The character variety and fast gameplay make it highly enjoyable.",,,,,,"Although it's incredibly easy and features one of the most stubborn cameras in recent memory, One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 is quite possibly one of the best Warriors-style experiences you'll have on modern consoles. It's slick, fast-paced, and weirdly charming, even if you don't know your Luffys from your Crocodiles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Maybe ONE PIECE: Pirate Warriors 4 will still not be able to convince the detractors of the musou genre, but at least the fans will be able to breathe a sigh of relief: this could be the beginning of a new era, at least for the turbulent pirates of Eiichiro Oda.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed my time with One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 yet it doesn't quite offer a wholly fresh and exciting gameplay formula. So, if you're happy with more of the same albeit with flashy visuals and cool special moves then you should give it a go.",,,,,,,"One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 is a great installation in the Pirate Warriors series and feels like a love letter to fans of the franchise. While the Musou style combat can feel extremely repetitive, it’s also quite satisfying and fun to mess around with. The story is exciting and does a good job at capturing the sense of adventure from the anime, even though we have seen many of these stories before.

Regardless, The Council remains unique and interesting enough throughout.","By combining the reinvigorating RPG elements of the premiere with detail-oriented puzzles, and adding new layers to this political mystery, it's all shaping up to be one of the best new series of the year. It's a lot of fun whether you're in it for the chess match of every conversation, the puzzles that demand you pay close attention, or the mystery that continues to tease.

The introduction of Lord Mortimer does little to clarify anything about the man, as he is still enshrouded in mystery, which makes waiting for the next episode even tougher.

The change in level design may feel unusual at first, but it is refreshing nonetheless even if it does also mean that the game is a short one.

Those interested in GTA style games should give this game – or at least this series – a try as there is a lot of fun to be had here.,,,,Saints Row: The Third Remastered preserves all the good things of the original game and adds a remodeled and renewed graphic section that brings it closer to the current times.,An almost perfect remastering of a game that is still fresh 9 years later.,Saints Row: The Third Remastered is a quirky and addictive action game that's one of the best remasters on Xbox One.,"In the end Saints Row The Third Remastered is a reminder that the style of action seen in Grand Theft Auto and Crackdown can find a cartoonish and juvenile middle-ground. A place where the concept of gangs and friendship is both comic and grounded. A place where player freedom lets you make your mark on the world with style and a distinct lack of grace. With the fourth Saints Row leaning ever more into the absurd, thanks to a plot that deals with alien invasions and virtual realities, Saints Row The Third Remastered is arguably the series at its best.","Saints Row The Third Remastered on Xbox One is big, brash and bloody brutal. And it’s just as much fun as it was upon the original release. But it’s also a bit clunky, provides unsatisfying combat opportunities, and the new visual style, whilst appreciated, doesn’t really bring it up to modern day standards. If you’re a Saints fan then you’ll have no trouble playing through this again, but those who have previously steered clear of the franchise probably won’t find much need for this remaster – no matter how much content it brings.",,,The “Saints Row The Third” part of Saints Row The Third Remastered is good. The “Remastered” part...not as much.,,,,,"Saints Row: The Third Remastered is an impressive return to this title. The developer went out of their way to bring this title back with plenty of upgrades and overhauls to make it feel like we remember.

As it stands this is the best version of the game to date and a perfect excuse for me to overrun Steelport once again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Saints Row: The Third Remastered is one of the most impressive guilty pleasures - one that also manages to be much more clever than it presents itself.

It's a simple yet creative concept and the sequel brings additional gameplay features that for the most part improve the overall variety of the experience. It gets a little tough and frustrating in the final third but the developers have deftly managed to avoid the majority of design obstacles for which the genre is notorious. It's an easy game to recommend in theory, but it's hard to justify the Xbox One version when the 360 version is backward compatible.","In some ways, de Blob 2 even improves upon its predecessor. It has a much improved camera, more frequent save points, and cutscenes that don’t show their age, all of which count as plusses in my book. Further, it allows a second player to join in the fun, which is a welcome addition for a game like this one. None of these changes represent massive steps forward, to be sure. But they all contribute towards making de Blob 2 every bit as enjoyable as the original de Blob.",,,"While it's true that it has some camera problems that can be annoying, it won't mess up the gaming experience the title offers: there's fun, humor and lots of color.

Sure the original Duck Tales is a blast, but most of these games have not aged as well as one would hope. Still, I cannot recommend it enough, it brought back memories.

While the grind for the costumes is real, the quest modes is a great way to learn more about all the characters in the game, and while the online mode is sparse for now, the support for this game will come in due time.

In solo play, Ghost Recon: Wildlands loses a bit of its mojo, but the game's unprecedented scale and piles of content should prove euphoric for fans of open world games.","Having hundreds of different weapon mods and customisation options are great if you’re a gun nut, but when everyone dies after a few hits it starts to lose its appeal. Instead it’s the stuff where strapping a vehicle or chopper with C4 and letting it glide into enemy territory before setting it off should have been encouraged more in the overall design. In the end, Ghost Recon Wildlands suffers because it plays things a little too safe and fails to make proper use of the gorgeous fictional world of Bolivia in a way that offers more than solid stealth shooting, fun co-op, and small bursts of player-created fun.","Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands does two things brilliantly; it provides a massive game full of content, vast environments and things to do, and it also is a hell of a lot of fun as a co-op game. The tactical nature never becomes too rigid, ensuring you stay in control of how best to tackle a mission. Story-wise, it’s a lot of little bits of storytelling to push you further on into the destabilisation of Santa Blanca, offering just enough to tide you over. All that really holds it back are a few bugs, the less enjoyable method of going it alone and not being able to utilise the cover system.",,,"This huge, wide-open shooter constantly shows its flaws in its mission variety and vehicle physics, but its strong, sandbox-style gameplay and seamless co-op kept me coming back for more madness. If you must repeat experiences over and over, you could far worse than helicopter chases, assassination missions, or drug busts gone wildly wrong.","Ghost Recon: Wildlands can provide countless hours of thrilling sandbox shooter gameplay, but co-op is needed to make the most of it. Its massive, numerous and diverse locales are often gorgeous to behold, and navigating them tactfully with a good co-op team is a blast. Just don't expect to have as much fun in single player, as your team limits your mission methods due to shaky AI and a lack of deep squad commands.",,,,"Ghost Recon: Wildlands is a rather fun co-op game. It’s made for co-op and should be played in co-op. While I’m against the solo play, I will say that solo players will have some rough times trying to get the AI to cooperate with you. But with a squad of four players, tagging enemies, syncing shots, and doing crazy stunts like jumping out of a helicopter onto and enemy base just to see what will happen is what really makes this game special. There are some issues here and there, and while the game can be difficult, it feels fair for the most part. The run and gun shooter fans may be put off from it, but I highly suggest Wildlands to players that are looking for a fun co-op shooter with some more tactical aspects. There’s a lot here for anyone who likes making their own fun in a giant sandbox.",,,,"A solid but glitch-riddled open-world tactical shooter that falls agonisingly short of realising its full potential, Ghost Recon Wildlands is the very definition of a 'nearly' game. It's so very nearly brilliant, but there are a few too many problems with it that mar the overall experience. Shame.",,,"As only the second open world game in the Clancyverse, Ghost Recon: Wildlands is a middlingly safe tactical shooter and a slightly wasted opportunity given the ambitious scope of its seemingly boundless map. While its main strength is its mission diversity, it doesn’t take long to lose the motivation after reaching El Sueno's doorstep. Even with a foursome of highly trained friends, Wildlands eventually reveals its diminishing returns. The feeling of positive immediacy and dopamine hits begin to wane sooner than you expected from a game with such a large and diverse world.",,,,,,,,,,,,"While the concept of team action in an open world (in fact, the biggest one from Ubisoft yet) is interesting without a doubt, the execution is lackluster. This is a typical example for “Jack of all trades, master of none”, where every aspect of the game is overshadowed by competition which simply is more refined´.",,,,,"Repetitive gameplay loops aside, the cooperative tactical variety and vast open world make Ghost Recon Wildlands a singular experience unlike any other shooter on the market. Wildlands may not succeed with all its ambitions, but it’s a compelling direction for the series that points to a fertile future.",,"Ghost Recon: Wildlands is by no means a terrible, or even bad, game: it provides moments of intense fun, particularly with friends, when you're trying to clear out a base without being detected. Yet, it has some serious issues. The A.I. coding is just not good; the huge draw distances causes stutter and screen-tearing on consoles; and even though there is undeniably a lot of content in the form of missions and things to collect, it does become repetitive and dull—just how quickly it becomes a drag depends on your tolerance for walking around and collecting things, I suppose. But if you don't have friends to play with, and you have to rely on boneheaded teammate A.I. to help you fight questionable and irrational enemy A.I., then the game's problems are amplified.",,"You shouldn’t buy Wildlands right now. The types of glitches and problems we experienced in previews still rear their head; while they’re forgivable in a pre-release environment, the same isn’t true when buying what should be a finished product. The entire experience is best summed up by our multiplayer adventure: you’ll run around a lot, but you’re not going to be able to get much done.",,"Completing the same type of mission over and again does wear on you. Still, there is fun to be had with Wildlands before the feeling of repetition sets in.",,,,,,,"It doesn’t have the “oomph” it should and comes off as a bit lackluster. For all of the good elements in the game, there are several bad or annoying ones that come with it.",,,"It seems crazy to say this, but Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Wildlands is a little too big for its own good. It’s hard not to admire the time and effort that went into crafting this truly massive and beautiful open world, but there’s simply too much copy and paste going on when it comes to the content within; the side missions especially, but also the story scenarios. While the initial hours of Wildlands are thrilling, repetition ultimately seeps in and as such you’re enjoyment of the game may depend on whether you have a friend or three to play through the campaign with. Ubisoft has done a tremendous job supporting a pair of other recent Tom Clancy titles post-launch – Rainbow Six: Siege and The Division – so even if you’re not sold on Wildlands as it stands, I highly recommend keeping your sights trained on the game as the developers tweak the experience and eventually add the competitive multiplayer suite.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As ambitious as it is, Ghost Recon: Wildlands fails to break free from the Ubisoft blueprint. However, that doesn't stop it from being an addictive, sprawling shooter, particularly when playing online.",,,,,,,,"As expected, Wildlands is at its best when players are on voice chat with a group of friends and the team is coming up with creative ways to take down cartel bosses by crashing planes into their mansions or picking off their guards with the help of drone intel. Although the game does stand-up in solo mode with fairly reliable AI partners, the massive world to explore becomes a little lonely and boring without some actual friends along for the ride.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This game is one that requires you to play with friends in order to extract the fun out of it. In single player, Wildlands is passable, but in multiplayer it shines. While the missions don’t do much in terms of variety, in playing with others, you find yourself expecting the unexpected. But the real hero is the vast open world, providing you with freedom to approach each objective in any way you wish. Yet while the open world giveth, it also taketh away. A lack of density is obvious, and meandering becomes the most frequent activity that you do.",,,,,,,,,,"But if you’re looking for a really big, extravagant sandbox game that’s great fun solo and hilarious in co-op, don’t be shy. Wildlands isn’t Ghost Recon as we know it, but it’s the wildest party in town.","Despite the noted flaws and imperfections that permeate some facets of this game, I can easily see this title draining many months and moons from one's life, and you'll be smiling most of the way. If Ubisoft can improve on the quality that is Ghost Recon Wildlands, the future looks incredibly bright. That being said, our focus is on the current game, and overall it is one that can be very enjoyable, and if you find the right online players to play with, the game can be even better. Tom Clancy fans owe themselves the time to check this game out, as it is good enough to satisfy a gamer's craving for action, stealth, and a very large world to explore.",,,,,,"Basically, Ghost Recon: Wildlands is a good game. It offers you a big wide world with many missions and possibilities. It combines the tactical gameplay we all know and love from other Ghost Recon games, with all of these elements spread out on the beautiful map of Bolivia. But its repetitiveness, forgettable story and the trouble finding a decent team make its problems more obvious than ever.",,,,,,,,,"In any other year, Ghost Recon: Wildlands would be a fine if somewhat unremarkable open-world game. By a twist of fate, it happened to release in a very crowded season for open-world games, which may make it seem pale in comparison. Where it stands out from Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Horizon: Zero Dawn, though, is its multiplayer focus. Though I found the repetition too much, those cathartic moments of perfect planning in multiplayer are enough to warrant giving it a try, as long as you have a squad of friends to back you up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the end, this is not a remastered version, but an overpriced old game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This version of Resident Evil 4 is a lazy conversion. 1080p resolution and 60fps are not enough because the game needed more care on the textures.,,,,,,,,"I looked hard for something wrong with this re-release of RE4, but I found… nothing. I suppose some could fault the developers for not adding a quick weapon switch to the D-pad (going into a briefcase to switch weapons has never been ideal) and it’s disappointing to see that the FMV sequences weren’t given the same visual overhaul as the rest of the title. Beyond those small quibbles, however, the game remains as good as it’s ever been. The campaign is the best in the series, the bonus chapter offers a huge amount of new content, and the costumes change the way the game is played. This really is one of the best games ever made, and over a decade later, it hasn’t lost any of its cachet.","Resident Evil 4 is a great classic that does not arrive in good condition on Xbox One because of a poor HD implementation. Capcom should be much better than this. Anyway, the game is suitable for those that have missed the original and don't have anymore the original consoles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Resident Evil 4 is far from being a good remastered version for the current generation consoles.

close-to-the-sun,,,,,,"While I was disappointed by the horror aspects in Close to the Sun, overall I found my time with it to be quite engaging. The story and characters get their hooks in just enough to keep you playing, and the world building – from the gorgeous visuals to the incidental details and notes left behind – is brilliant. That it keeps its run time brief is to the games credit too, as yet more chase sequences would definitely have harmed the experience.",,,"Close to the Sun offers an intriguing plot revolving around Nikola Tesla's theories and interesting steampunk environments, but it could have been more compelling with better puzzles and more variety. All in all, though, it's an interesting first-person adventure.","Despite the strength of his first episodes, where the player immerses himself fully in his modernist and art deco architecture. Close to the Sun is diluted as the adventure progresses. The premise of Helios as a research vessel where the brightest minds of their time could develop their ideas without limits inevitably reminds Rapture, however, any comparison with Bioshock beyond the setting is odious. Little ambitious in its playable mechanics, it misses a good amount of very promising premises that we would have liked to see better exploited.","The feeling of loneliness and the constant tension to which the title submits are two of its strong points that, together with its argument, make Close to the Sun a different and interesting proposal.","While the game has an intriguing premise, an attractive art style, and sits at a breezy length, it doesn't do enough. It wants to fly close to the sun, but it can barely get off the ground.",,The exploration elements and the story are of a very high standard and the visuals manage to delicately capture the whole concept of the game in a fantastic way.,,,,,,,,,,,,"A very competent, well-made survival horror adventure with clear BioShock inspirations, Close to the Sun is a smart and compelling game marred only by some ill-advised showing of naff monsters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s a spectacular and beautiful experience you should not pass up. This is easily one of the best releases of the year, and if you have read this far, you already know it’s something you need to try for yourself.",,,,,,,"Close to the Sun is decent, but I can't help but feel that the game could been so much more. The overall atmosphere and especially the sound is fantastic! If you're looking for a game with a decent engaging story, you might like this one, but don't play it expecting the next Outlast or Bioshock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bioshock is my favorite game of all time, and the Helios drew me into its environment and story very similar to how I was drawn into Rapture 12 years ago. The story telling and voice acting are all top notch and are backed up by an atmosphere that many Bioshock copies have tried to mimic, but I felt never got quite right. Close to the Sun is a joy to play through if you don’t get too frustrated at the chase sequences and as long as you like hunting for collectibles to fill out some backstory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

journey-to-the-savage-planet,"In the end, the titular journey proves to be far more satisfying than the eventual destination, but so it is with all adventures into outer space in search of unknown powers, right? The success here is how it meshes and moulds so many familiar ideas and motifs, while remaining so alien. [Issue#187, p.87]",,,,"As a whole, Journey to the Savage Planet is a rather simple game but still manages to find unique ways to challenge a player both during combat and exploration. My only dislike is that there could have been a few more side missions that didn’t revolve around item collection. It would have been great to have more incentive to go off the main path aside from hunting for upgrades. But in saying that, I found the exploration aspect of this game quite fun thanks to the innovative level design. This is definitely a fun little game that is worth checking out or playing with a friend.","I had a rather great time with Journey to the Savage Planet. With bright visuals full of colour and character sucking you in and some funny, engaging writing encouraging progression, Typhoon have done a solid job on their first outing. Great exploration and combat are just the icing on the cake, with more than enough to do to keep you coming back for some time.",,,"Journey to the Savage Planet is a very enjoyable and satisfying space adventure, with great humour and full of surprises and crazy situations, even if a bit short. We'd love to see a sequel funded with a bigger budget.",Journey to the Savage Planet is a good survival experience with an interesting narrative component and that lacks in gunplay.,,,"The comedy which can be described as absurdist is also full of heart and warmth, and there’s a focus on positivity you can feel throughout.","Journey to the Savage Planet on Xbox One is an amazing game – there are no two ways about it. It plays fast and fluidly, the enemies are challenging to kill (especially the bosses) and with a beautifully scripted, humorous thread of story running through it’s been a joy to play. In fact, if the netcode had worked properly at all times it would be a slam dunk for this Savage Planet, but even then you still owe it to yourself to play this game. It really is that good.",,,"Journey to the Savage Planet is a game with a lot of nice ideas – trying to single-handedly twist a well-worn genre into new and exciting shapes – but ultimately doesn’t quite have the courage to commit to them. There’s a lot to enjoy, particularly in its opening hours, but for all its grand ambitions, Savage Planet ultimately falls back on tired ideas to see it through to an underwhelming end.

The wonderfully gloopy animation and conception of Carrion’s meaty monster makes it enjoyable to play, especially when tearing through the unfortunate humans that stand in your way. But dull exploration, a lack of memorable environments and disparate gameplay ideas that never really come together, mean that Carrion never truly reaches its full potential.","Yes, the game lacks readability when there are too many enemies. Yes, its level design sometimes loses the player. But Carrion is a successful game that takes being a monster to the extreme.",,"When it's letting you live out its proposed reverse-horror fantasy, Carrion is at its best. It excels at making you feel empowered as an evolving lab experiment gone wrong, giving you ample opportunities to flex your death-dealing tentacles and tear enemies limb from limb. While giving you numerous tools to wreak havoc, it also uses them in smart ways to find a good balance between its gory combat and problem-solving. Carrion falters when it requires too much fine precision from you with a control scheme that doesn't allow for it, and is at its lowest when you're not playing as its headlining monster at all. These are disappointing distractions, but Carrion's main event is still a bloody great time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"What it does, it does well. But what it doesn’t do is what really drags it down to not feeling like an exceptional game.

I know they are out there, but I was very frustrated to be getting lost all the time. I wanted something in-game to at least give me a simple hint. Even if it let me know the area that I needed to go, it would have been helpful. It’s really a pretty good game otherwise. I might try it one more time, but if I get lost for an hour I’m hanging up the tentacles for good.

It might utilize some video game tropes, but it doesn’t seem too concerned with accepted video game values. It’s a 2D side-scroller without platforming, an action game where you dictate the action.

But if you like open world exploration with fast paced gun fighting, and a hero story like an OTT Hollywood action movie, you'll probably like Andromeda.",,,,"I’m conflicted about Mass Effect: Andromeda. There’s a lot of roughness throughout the game, and the technical issues, while not game-breaking, are often incredibly distracting...But it’s my time with the cast that I’m still thinking about, and the mysteries about the world that haven’t been answered that make me feel like I’m waiting once again for a new Mass Effect game. And if I’m judging a game by where it leaves me, Andromeda succeeds, even if it stumbled getting there.",,,,"Exploration is a great deal of fun right up until the denizens of the newly discovered planets drag you into their own problems, which aren't all that impressive in the grand scheme. Nobody said being a Pathfinder would be easy, but it probably would have been a bit more tolerable if it wasn't so mired in managing tedium.",,,"It is a new start. For mankind. For the hero. For the franchise. For Bioware. And for the most time, it gives you decent entertainment, albeit very safe and carbon-copied from ME1 and other sci-fi franchises - Andromeda treats the original basically like The Force Awakens approaches the elements of A New Hope. Just don’t expect anything new or fancy. Plus: the script quality varies between good, fairly decent and outright embarrassing and awkward.",,,,,,,,,Mass Effect: Andromeda is a science-fiction fan’s wet dream; a game incredibly difficult to put down once started.,,"Overall, despite its shortcomings Mass Effect: Andromeda was an enjoyable experience for me. The first few hours feel like a grind, but you will be rewarded for sticking with it. The game is dragged down a bit by all of the reading that must be done and some overly long conversations, but this is rather typical for the genre. The game really shines when you're exploring an alien world and battling the local fauna, and when you get down to it that's what you really want out of a space-based RPG.",,,,,,,"Mass Effect: Andromeda at times captures the essence of the Mass Effect trilogy but doesn’t quite live up to its potential. The story and its lovable cast of characters stand as solid starting blocks in an expansive universe. Performance issues, bugs, and design flaws hurt an otherwise commendable role-playing game.",,,,"Mass Effect: Andromeda is a paradox: it's both disappointing and excellent. A mammoth title, it delivers tons of great content, but hamstrings itself with a poor first few hours, a few horrible systems, and some uninspired scenarios. Even so, it's pretty great.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mass Effect: Andromeda doesn’t quite live up to the hype, but it comes close. Considering the situation in which the developers found themselves, they put out an addition to the franchise that really feels like returning home even though you’re millions of light years from Earth. With stunning scenery, a distinct Mass Effect feel, and an abundance of things to do, it’s a worthy investment for any Mass Effect veteran or newcomer—but don’t expect it to be perfect.","Whether it's a new beginning or a better beginning, only time will tell. This new Mass Effect tries its best to walk in Shepard's shoes on a different galaxy, but your willingness to forgive Andromeda's flaws and start anew depends on how fond you were of the original saga.",,,,"Mass Effect: Andromeda spends a lot of time not really feeling like a Mass Effect game. If anything, it feels like a spin-off -- the sort of thing created by another studio that's unsure about what direction to take it. Like in the game itself, there are problems with the atmosphere.","There is a strong core of characters and story bedrock laid down in Mass Effect: Andromeda, but between questionable design choices, boring missions, and glitches galore, it’s hard not to view BioWare’s journey to a brand new galaxy as anything less than mission failure.",,"Mass Effect: Andromeda is a game for a different kind of gamer. Those who can appreciate the lore and immense depth of stories upon stories, upon stories. However, if you’re a newcomer and are interested in the content that this game brings, I encourage you, it is a wonderful ride. The universe, characters, tone, the music… EVERYTHING plays a part in this game and melds together in a way that feels like this could be where our technology heads towards in 600 years.",,,,"A new low for the Mass Effect series. [Issue#186, p.71]",,,,,,,"Mass Effect: Andromeda is far from a perfect game, but it is an absolute must-play for fans of science-fiction or BioWare RPGs. The storytelling is at an all-time high once things get underway and players who make it through the adventure will be unlikely to regret their time spent in this new corner of the Mass Effect universe.",,,"The writing itself is often uncomfortable. Every line feels like an attempted one-liner vying for your attention, the result being conversations and interactions that often sounds unnatural. Both the larger story and these rough exchanges turn what should be a very interesting and nuanced premise into a great lolloping narrative that leaps from one thing to the next.","Mass Effect Andromeda is a huge space opera, made by interesting character stories and a beautiful and dynamic combat system, set up in beautiful planets rich with activities and sub-quests.","Mass Effect Andromeda is the anticipated sequel to the hit space trilogy that, sadly enough, doesn’t deliver. Sketchy animations, uninspiring characters and uneven story make this one a space-adventure to quickly forget.","Mass Effect: Andromeda is simply an amazing game. It renews the franchise yet manages to feel really familiar for fans. Unfortunately, the game suffers from some technical problems, but they hardly impact the gameplay.",,,,"At times, Mass Effect: Andromeda can feel like an expansion and not a true follow-up. A lot of strides have been made to improve the already dazzling combat system (which is leaps and bounds more exciting than your average cover shooter), but so much of it feels like a regression. That slip still puts it a cut above a lot of others in the same space, but the failure to iterate after the divisive conclusion of the original trilogy isn't going to do BioWare any favours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andromeda is still Mass Effect, and for some that might be enough, but this avenue needs more to be held in similar esteem. It does reach a satisfying conclusion, at least as far as the buildup warrants, but it takes the long way around. It does hit something that feels like a fresh, Mass Effect-patterned beginning, but a lot of the sophistication in plot that’s alluded to is left up in the air. Of course, we've also heard all of this before, when people were unsure about just what BioWare was trying to do with the original Mass Effect. It really took us two games to come to believe in the vision in the first instance, and perhaps that is the case with our new home in Andromeda, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s a shame that the central narrative of Mass Effect Andromeda is deflated by this burdensome gameplay, because the crew of the Tempest is worth meeting. The mystery of the Kett is a fresh spin on the apocalyptic war of the original trilogy, and following the stories of people in the Heleus cluster often leads to surprising developments with tough decisions waiting at the end. Ryder’s tale and the thrill of colonizing a new star system set Andromeda apart from other Mass Effect games, but it often plays worse than a game from five years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
crawl,,,,,,,"Crawl is a fun co-op dungeon crawler that sets the hero against his ghostly former friends as they race to make it out of the dungeon alive. Its innovative game mechanic keeps heroes and monsters at much the same level throughout, so the hero has to stay on his toes as he and the ghosts fight it out for control of the one remaining body in the dungeon. With the procedurally-generated nature of the title, players needn't fear getting bored with the same old dungeons and enemies each time, and fighting one's way through epic co-op battles will be a good time with friends. The game suffers in single-player, however, by giving an obvious edge to the AI and being overwhelming for those just starting the game. The achievements will offer a challenge to even hardcore gamers in both the range of different types of achievements as well as the difficulty of several of them. Fans will find plenty to keep them busy.",,A thrilling and surprising mix of a roguelike game and a local multiplayer experience. Too bad for the lack of online multiplayer support.,Crawl is a pixel art based dungeon crawler that gives an extraordinary experience that improves so much when is played with friends. Become a hero or fight against him controlling an interesting catalogue of demons and creatures. Crawl is an incredible fun game that gives so many options to play as you want.,"Crawl is a new game that uses pixel art to recreate warriors, creatures and catacombs in which action and strategy take the lead over everything. If you went to the mall thirty years ago, it would have occupied a privileged place in your usual arcade room thanks to its high addictiveness.","While Crawl is a very good local multiplayer game, the single-player experience doesn't quite measure up. You can play against one to three bots (the fewer bots, the easier) and select the difficulty of the bots. Competing against ghost bots is fun for a while, but given the short nature of each run, repetition sets in eventually. You should consider Crawl a maybe if you mostly play by yourself, but it's a must-buy if you have friends or family to bring along on your crawls.",,"Overall and whilst Crawl may not be what every dungeon crawling fan is used to, it certainly offers something new for local multiplayer fans. With surprisingly capable bots on hand to fill the empty spaces should you be flying solo, you’ll find a perfectly enjoyable game for a quiet afternoon session in this cracking title.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A fun game that's eve funnier when played with friends on its local multiplayer. If it's not played that way, Crawl will show its less good side, being a bit dull.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Even if you play solo, Crawl is a fun title that doesn’t require a huge time investment to gain some enjoyment. Defeating a dungeon’s massive boss is exciting and rewarding, as is landing that final blow to the survivor and regaining your humanity. With 4 friends on a couch, playing locally is a blast, though expect many swear words to be thrown at each other while doing so, in the best possible way of course.

watch-dogs-legion,,"After so much anticipation, Watch Dogs: Legion is finally here, failing to impress. Almost every single problem that prevented the two previous versions from reaching their full potential is still there, and the ability to play as all NPCs added even more issues to the game. Yes, the world is beautiful and you have all the freedom that you want, but as a game, Watch Dogs Legion is shallow and suffers from poor level and character design. A strong contender for the most disappointing game of the year.",,,"Personally, I’m glad that “Legion” took a darker turn and really explored the true possibilities of how technology can be used for malice purposes, as it gives the player a real sense of triumph taking down these digital villains. I do recommend caution for younger gamers, as “Legion” is definitely aimed at an older audience. Regardless, “Watch Dogs: Legion” has an enormous amount of replay value and a very compelling storyline with unexpected twists along the way.","All in all, Watch Dogs: Legion is a brilliant third instalment to the franchise. I am loving the fact you can play as pretty much anyone, but I have yet to find my favourite character that I 100% want to always play. But with so many to choose from I think I will be constantly changing. The story is interesting and the hacking is smooth and rewarding. For me, this is a must-play.","With a darker storyline and a wonderfully re-imagined London that is the star of the show, the third entry into the franchise feels as if it’s slightly matured from Watch Dogs 2. The new ‘play as anyone’ mechanic is innovative but sadly soon becomes redundant. Numerous bugs and glitches also mar the overall experience. Having the game crash several times and losing about 20 minutes worth of progress each time is not something that should be happening with a big-budget title such as Legion. Even after downloading the latest hotfix, crashing issues still persisted. This will likely be fixed with more patches later on down the line, but it will still be disappointing for those who purchase the game on day one. However, if you can keep a stiff upper lip about some of the bugs, you’ll have a lot of fun with Legion. Even if someone does end up calling you a twatwaffle.","If I’d paid full price for it on release day, I’d be wondering why I paid so much money for a game that feels closer to EDF or Goat Simulator than anything else. Obviously, I had fun with it, so I wouldn’t say never buy it or never play it — but you may be better off waiting it bit for it to come down in price. Then you hop in, and start crashing cars and causing mayhem to your heart’s content.","Watch Dogs Legion keeps the series' base mechanics while enhancing the whole formula thanks to the higher gameplay and tactical variety provided by the huge choice of agents available. This has the downside of making every character pretty forgettable though, keeping us from establishing an emotional bond with any of them.","Watch Dogs Legion is a game that does not risk in the gameplay and seeks its charm in a captivating, dystopian and futuristic London, which is the real star of the game along with all its citizens.","Watch Dogs Legion is the new and ambitious release of the Ubisoft saga, a title that manages to catch you from the first moment and that fulfills its promise to perfection: to play with any NPC.",,,"It’s a vibrant and exciting open world full of a wealth of missions, side missions, and recruiting to do, complemented by some decent visuals and brilliant audio work. As the hours have progressed I’ve become ever more excited for the opportunities that it throws up, so much so that now I’m already well invested in upcoming DLC and the promise of multiplayer elements.",,,,"Watch Dogs: Legion is incredibly ambitious, but the play as anyone system needs a little more work. The story suffers from the lack of a central protagonist, and it's hard to get attached to any of your characters when the character models and animations are stiff and robotic. Still, there's a lot of fun to be had in futuristic London.","Watch Dogs Legion is a rather fun game built on the basis of a very interesting storyline. Too bad that gameplay is excessively anchored to the two previous chapters, and the tech side is quite disappointing.","I’ve loved all three Watch Dogs games, but Watch Dogs Legion may be my favourite. Perhaps it’s the familiarity of London, or perhaps it’s the unique joy of being able to take control of pretty much any character you want. There’s so much to see and do; the amount of character and life breathed into the city is unrivalled by pretty much any other open world game. Even once the credits roll, there’s so much left for you experience. It’s not perfect (what is?) but there’s nothing else quite like Watch Dogs Legion. If you love an open world game and revel in the freedom to approach missions however you want, then this is the game for you.",,"My gripes really stem from the place of being a fan. Anyone entering Watch Dogs: Legion looking for a by the books open world game is going to find a lot to enjoy. There are small puzzles to solve, plenty of collectibles, lots of missions and I would say the shooting and driving are the best this series has ever been. Fans of the series like myself however will be disappointed by the lack of enjoyable characters as well as stand out missions and story beats. With how close Legion is releasing to Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla and Immortals Fenyx Rising it feels like Watch Dogs: Legion was left to fight for your attention and your money with less money put into development. I would recommend both Watch Dogs 1 & 2 as well as plenty of other Ubisoft experiences from the last few years before Legion at full price.",,,,"Ubisoft Toronto has done a fine job in bringing a broken, near-future London to grim life in Watch Dogs: Legion, and playing as anyone you like has a certain appeal, but ultimately, it doesn't quite work as well as one might have hoped.","Some scars from the previous opus - physics engine and dated collisions, AI enemies still very strange - come here to temper our enthusiasm somewhat and show all the imperfections of Legion, but it has enough qualities to convince fans of the license to dive back into it again.","Though the replacement of authored characters with procedurally generated avatars has mixed results, Watch Dogs Legion is unique among GTA-style open world crime games as a result. The city is vast and beautiful, your options for vigilante havoc very broad and the potential for it all to explode into a memorably janky anecdote generally sky high.","Watch Dogs Legion is an anti-fascist game, and it's admirable that it sticks to that message and sees it through to a satisfying and affirming conclusion. It also bolsters the franchise's clever hacking gameplay to offer more creativity than ever. One of Legion's more profound messages is about what it means to be a true Londoner, and by the game's end, you'll have a DedSec crew made of wildly diverse and disparate citizens from unique cultural, ethnic, and economic backgrounds--all united in their goal to restore their home. If anything, that's as powerful a message for the game as you can get…Watch Dogs: Legion struggles with tone at times, but its empowering message about unity and justice still shines in a game that is as absurd as it is impactful.",,,"Being able to Play As Anyone in Watch Dogs: Legion is impressive at first, but it becomes a detriment to the core experience that's in need of revitalization. The hacking and stealth infiltrations haven't changed a bit, and with repetitive mission design and numerous technical issues, this latest chapter finds DedSec in an identity crisis.",,"Mostly, I am impressed at how Ubisoft Montreal got me to care about people more than skills, even in a game set up to prioritize the latter. Like a card trick, I’m left with the sense that the developers coaxed me to pick the person it needed to complete this particular chapter of the story, while making it seem like it was my call all the way. For interactive entertainment, that’s outstanding storytelling, and it supports gameplay that has rewarded my own risk-taking and creativity with the urge to play it all again, with an entirely new cast",,,,,,"The failures of Legion lie at its very heart, in the option to play as anybody you want. The only way to recommend this game? Try it out if you wish to virtually visit a beautiful, faithfully recreated London.",,"I haven’t played a game as odd as Legion in a very long time. Unlike the glossy, beautiful, but samey open-worlds that have dominated the genre in the past few years, it is ambitious, imperfect and unashamedly weird. To me it’s a fascinating, flawed, well-intentioned experiment in what a game can have to say, and how it can say it, while still conforming to the established fun-first template of an open-world action game. London’s landmarks are all here, from the Tower to the Eye, but rather than reducing the city to a pretty backdrop for generic madcap violence, it lets you find your own fun – or even your own meaning – in what you do there.",,"Watch Dogs: Legion is a bold move with a few highlights here and there, but still a disappointment that will have you going back to Watch Dogs 2 instead.",,"Legion feels like the realization of the hacker fantasy the first Watch Dogs tried to capture. Between the fun team-building, fantastic mission design, strong narrative, and a gorgeous world, everything comes together in a largely entertaining and cohesive package. Whether you’re controlling a trained super spy or a gassy grandmother, Watch Dogs: Legion is a ton of fun.",,"If you’re a fan of Ubisoft’s open-world design, then you’ll enjoy this game to an extent, but there’s little done here that Watch Dogs 2 didn’t do as well or more so in 2016. It’s a fun stealth-action open-world hacking game, but it’s one that falls under its own weight in many ways. So please, do not play the Xbox One S version. Like the first Watch Dogs, it over promises, under preforms, and this soon-to-be previous-generation version will be forgotten quickly.","Watch Dogs Legion builds upon the solid foundation established by Watch Dogs 2 while adding its own ambitious twist with mixed results. Having literally every character playable is a gargantuan task, and from a gameplay perspective it works to cement Legion as the best Watch Dogs game thus far. Narratively speaking, however, it collapses under its own aspiration to offer an intriguing concept with spotty execution. Regardless, Legion is a triumph for making good on most of its lofty promise and a triumph for the series.",,,,"Watch Dogs Legion is a very traditional open world that relies on its new recruiting system, with almost limitless possibilities. The figure of a protagonist and a little more evolution is missed, but getting lost in London is always fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Legion doesn’t quite reach the lofty heights of its San Francisco predecessor. Your team isn’t as endearing, the missions aren’t as fun and the story is just not quite as engaging. Though, if you take the time to explore the streets of London, and make it your playground, there is still lots to like. The gameplay loop is addictive once you get into it and if you can look past the bugs and pantomime voices, you’ll be happy you digitally toured one of the worlds greatest cities, albeit a bleak one.","It’s a convincing facsimile, which makes trying to save it from Albion and its assorted cronies a more compelling task. And Legion’s big gimmick is that you can play as, well, anyone. Construction workers, lawyers, YouTube stars, retired cage fighters, Anarchists, football hooligans. All are served up by Ubisoft’s smart procedurally-generated trick, each with their own look, background and sometimes even voting record.",,,,,,"Watch Dogs: Legion feels like a huge step forward for the franchise, but the ridiculous amount of bugs and glitches make playing through the experience a real headache.",,,"Watch Dogs: Legion has accomplished its promises. Ubisoft Toronto has focused its efforts on making the Play as Anyone mechanic work properly. And yes, they have.","Watch Dogs: Legion is a fascinating game, massively ambitious and crawling with technology that isn’t just on the bleeding edge of what’s possible, it’s pure magic to see unfold. All of that may sound impressive but slick software and a bustling metropolis of people power can’t hide the dull gameplay and shallow approach to the sandbox shenanigans of Watch Dogs: Legion. It’s still a fascinating game to experience in short bursts, and it’s going to be fascinating to see how Ubisoft evolves London to make it vox pop as a next-gen headliner.",,"London in Watch Dogs Legion is a great open world with a lot of things, crazy actions and hacks to do, and is really fun. But it repeats the same mistakes of previous Watch Dogs games, with a poor driving experience and missions with a lack of variety.",,"Watch Dogs: Legion pushes through Ubisoft’s generally noncommittal attitude towards storytelling and exploiting current events to create something that feels like a genuine shift, or at least the prototype of that shift. It might be a sloppy game in many regards, but Legion offers a novel way to experience an open world, with its interconnected NPCs and the introduction of permadeath to the genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Watch Dogs Legion is an easy game to recommend for fans of the franchise, as it continues to utilize the solid gameplay foundation established by its predecessor. While the lack of a main character may not be a hit with everyone, it works surprisingly well. Over the last three iterations, Watch Dogs has introduced more and more player freedom, but with Legion, Ubisoft takes things to an insane new level.",,,,"Unlike the previous chapters, Watch Dogs Legion has a strong identity and some bold takes on the action adventure genre, on top of an inspired setting. However, it still suffers the usual Ubisoft open world's troubled progression and meaningful narrative.",,,"It's tremendous fun, despite recurring problems we've come to expect from Ubisoft games occasionally threatening to derail the experience.",,,,"It’s hard not to characterize Watch Dogs: Legion as “Ubisoft open-world game with hacking”, but that’s what it is. That’s not inherently a bad thing, but I believe that more could have been done with the new mechanics without taking away from other portions. Overall, Watch Dogs: Legion is a fun game with a shiny new mechanic that can be utilized in different ways in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Watch Dogs Legion is an enjoyable open-world adventure that provides you with a beautiful vision of dystopian London to explore, but its ambitious mechanics simply don’t reach the heights I was hoping for.","Watch Dogs: Legion really impressed me with its ‘recruit anyone’ mechanic. While I wasn’t initially sure what to make a the non-central main character, it really didn’t affect things as a whole expected it to. The city of London is visually impressive and I’m constantly deep scanning NPC’s I come across to see if they’d make a worthy DedSec member. If you’re a fan of the series, Legion improves many facets of its gameplay, has a great campaign with clever writing and had me wanting to hack the planet by the time the credits rolled, even if the odd crash here and there frustrated.","It’s got a great story with a fun and inventive design. The “recruit anyone” mechanic is well designed and well implemented as are the ideas of what happens when characters are taken out of commission, regardless of whether you’re using the permadeath mode or not. The world is gorgeous, continually inviting you to dive back in and see what/who you can find.",,,The amount of freedom Watch Dogs: Legion offers is deep and it’s accompanied with distinctive systems that are worth exploring.,,,,,,,,"Watch Dogs fans and more die-hard anarchists among you might enjoy it more, but between the short storylines, underwhelming tech and mission types and the general “everything is on fire” vibe, it just doesn’t rate highly for me.",,,,,"The ability to play as anyone and have them feel like real people with unique skills and backstories is engaging for dozens of hours. While I'm still waiting for one of these games to say something meaningful regarding their tinderbox political backdrops, the gameplay systems are interwoven smartly and deeply, making Watch Dogs: Legion the next major leap for open-world games.",,,,Ubisoft have done well with this game but if you get frustrated easily I would maybe wait till this game has had a few more updates first before playing it.,,,,,"What players will find when picking up Watch Dogs: Legion is a game that is prepared for a long post-launch game-as-a-service experience. The additional DLC announced so far leans into the strengths of the game and established ideas that the series does well. The beekeepers, paintball guns and magician tricks all bring a sense of playful humour to the series, but it is worth noting that anyone who is (rightfully) tired of Ubisoft's content approach to games is going to find this one a very content-driven game.",,,,,,,,,,"A great idea that never quite reaches its full promise, Watch Dogs: Legion is still a cracking bit of techno fun. Come for the hacking and stay for the engaging story and cockney accents.",,,,,"Watch Dogs: Legion is an interesting game in that it doesn’t feature a real main protagonist outside of the comical AI, Bagley. You may not care about each individual character, but their collective goal makes the narrative worth seeing through. The way you can take on missions any way you wish rings truest in this title, and what better set piece to do it all in than a fully realized London. Looking past some of the open-world janks may be required, but Watch Dogs: Legion is a hacking great time.","Legion's near-future London is almost too close for comfort, though the game it hosts is a characterless slog.",,,,,,"Watch Dogs: Legion is a good game that could have been a great game if it had fully committed to its systems. Its recreation of London is stunning, its core concept is up there with Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis system in terms of innovation, and I would love to see where it could go if Ubisoft gives the team a second crack at it. With a stronger story, a much better ending, an improved driving model, and a bit more polish, I could see Legion being a classic. I hope the series continues in this interesting direction and it’s not unceremoniously shunted into a lake.","Watch Dogs is a good game that adds some layers to the original WD formula. Also the game offers a wide variety of missions and characters that manage to make the game fresh during a huge amount of hours. It may work better when you are trying to be stealthy and have some bugs along the way, but it's an interesting game.",,,,,"Watch Dogs: Legion made some hefty promises leading up to launch, and I’m happy to report it follows through on the big ones.

jurassic-world-evolution,"A flawed yet ultimately winning tie-in that serves up the best dinos on Xbox. [Sept 2018, p.72]",,,,"The game may not hold many peoples interest for too long. Something keeps me coming back for more though. While not perfect, it is a nice addition to the Jurassic park franchise…and you get to be the one that calls the shots, and make all the mistakes this time.

Frontier Developments’ carefully crafted and well balanced gameplay mechanics ensures that it’s accessible for genre veterans and newcomers alike. The game does an excellent job at keeping the player engaged through its diverse sites, which is bolstered further by its great pace, its decent progression system and its vast amount of options.","Minor problems and bugs stop the game from being absolutely spotless, but aside from that, the game is everything you could want in a simulation game. At some point you've probably wished Jurassic Park really existed. For now, this is the closest you can get.",,"A very good sim game, with perfect console controls and satisfying progression. And all this without even considering it's filled of dinosaurs: a must buy.",It has some flaws and a few things could be better but Jurassic World Evolution is a complete game faithful to the license.

Jackson’s character) dealing with yet another one of Nedry’s problems.","Some may see Evolution as just a fancy looking Zoo Tycoon, and they’d probably be right, but when you throw in some brilliant visuals, a huge amount of Jurassic Park lore, cameos bringing in the most famous characters from the big screen flicks, and that music, you’ll quickly understand how Jurassic World Evolution is much more than that.",,,,,,,,"When Evolution works, it works beautifully. It is precisely the game I wanted it to be. I wish the free mode was unlocked from the start, but it doesn’t take much to get it open. Future updates and some promised free DLC means I will be digging into this game for months to come. Couple that with the ridiculous prices online for the original Operation Genesis and I will stick with this updated Jurassic Park builder.",,,,"Jurassic World: Evolution might not be the deepest RTS out there in terms of options and mechanics, but as far as Jurassic Park experiences go, this is probably the best one that exists out there.",,,Evolution captures the essence of Jurassic Park while being a good park management sim in its own right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jurassic World: Evolution is a decent movie tie-in with amazing potential; if Frontier can equip players with the knowledge they need to tackle its increasingly difficult island chain, this one will have some legs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jurassic World: Evolution is an island-making sim where frustration and wait-times are scarier than any of the dinosaurs. The idea of creating 40 dinosaurs and their enclosures sounds like a real treat, but in this case, I’m sure Dr. Grant would have stayed at his dig site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jurassic World Evolution is one of the most beautiful park builder games out there, and we love the way dinosaurs are recreated from the movie. It is also easy enough to let newcomers enjoy this genre. Sometimes we felt progress is too slow even for a strategy game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jurassic World: Evolution is the best kind of management sim, one that wraps challenging decisions inside a slick, fun experience with humour and a little family-friendly gore.","It’s not the in-depth park management game that some may be looking for, and there is a fair bit of repetition with in-game quests, but I still really enjoyed my time with Jurassic World Evolution. Creating new dinosaurs and having a successful park was extremely satisfying and addictive, and recommended for anyone looking to immerse themselves in the Jurassic Park Universe. Just remember, you’ll have to learn a lot on your own, but once you do, it will be a dinosaur park sim game you should enjoy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
redout,,,,,,,,"Of course, for PS4 owners, at least, there is the little matter of the aforementioned Wipeout Omega Collection, which does the futuristic racer thing better than Redout could ever dream. There’s something ironic about a game from the past capturing the vibe of the future better than a game that came out this year, but when the alternative is as forgettable as this, the choice is pretty clear.","A highly adrenalinic love letter to classical racers like WipeOut and F-Zero, yet maintaining an original, challenging and very satisfying gameplay style with gorgeous visuals.",,"RedOut: Lightspeed Edition is an amazing experience that came out of the blue for the fans of anti-gravity games.

With a good variety of races, great track design, and both local and online multiplayer, this is the start of a series that deserves to continue long into the future.",,"I for one would love to see the return of anti-gravity racers to the market once more, but Redout simply doesn’t provide the same magic seen in previous titles in the genre, and with a hefty price tag to accompany it, this is probably one headache we can all do without.",,,,,,,,"Redout doesn’t do much new for the genre aside from an interesting twist with the redout feature. Though it doesn’t have to re-invent the wheel but simply give use their take on the ultimate speed test. The online issue is a shame, and the only other issue I ran into was on some tracks and depending on how many racers are on screen, the framerate would falter before getting back to its smooth performance. In a game like this that’s a big blunder and extremely noticeable, but it doesn’t break the game and it’s workable. It just sticks out like a complete sore thumb in an otherwise solid package. For the price of entry, Redout sticks out as a great entry in the futuristic racing genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Redout is confirmed as an interesting alternative for WipeOut.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We were expecting a lot from Redout, maybe too much because this game is far from taking the crown off WipEout's head because of a crappy AI and a poor feeling in the steering.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite its flaws, I kept coming back for more. It’s quite possible that developer 34BigThings could have a successful franchise in their hands – I suppose we’ll know for sure in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I went into Redout: Lightspeed Edition with very little expectations, and I came out very surprised. The game has solid visuals and great sound, all which really help this game come alive on-screen. The speed that you race at is very fast too, and without any issues such as slowdown, screen tearing or the like. The game’s control is just as good, as the combination of using both analog sticks when steering is very intuitive and useful. Where Redout seems to stutter a bit though is that the speed itself, along with the track design, can cause you some trouble, as hitting the wall on repeated occasions is unavoidable, and the AI ramps up its challenge very quickly, but these issues don’t make it a bad game. Fans of futuristic racing, and fans of racing games as a whole, will find a lot to like about this game, and for the price I think that most will get some great bang for the buck out of it. It’s just sad though that the online community seems non-existent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game's difficulty level also ramps up early on, guaranteeing some trying gameplay for much of the game. The game's achievements are nice mix of easy and difficult, providing a nice selection of challenges, but with the 100% and no-dying-allowed boss fight requirements, it will not be a fast or easy completion except for those with amazing platforming instincts.

strange-brigade,"A stylish, unsubtle but solid co-op shooter with lashings of old-school charm. [Nov 2018, p.75]",,,,"If you’re looking for a fun game that doens’t take itself too seriously, Strange Brigade is the game for you!","Strange Brigade is a treat. One that’s jam-packed with action, charm and personality. Everything from the game’s multi-branching level design, to its impressive variety of enemies and weaponry, rarely fails to excite. The game’s mashup of heavy combat, puzzle solving and collectible-seeking, makes for a gorgeously detailed adventure that’s constantly fun and dynamic. This is among Rebellion’s finest work to date.","Puzzles seem designed to slow you but never halt you and thus they aren't that interesting. The same can be said for repetitive objectives and visuals. It reads like a laundry list of problems, and yet it remains a lot of fun anyway thanks to strong enemy variety and a frantic pace to the action. If you're looking for a co-op shooter that doesn't demand a lot of you other than good aim and a few good friends, Strange Brigade is a smart choice.",,,"Strange Brigade is Rebellion's dynamic and content-rich new IP. Although Strange Brigade doesn't shake TPS genre up, it's well executed, shootings are enjoyable and a wide variety of enemies and puzzles. With its impeccable artistic style, Strange Brigade is interesting and pleasant enough to give it a chance.",A title that wins if you play it with someone else but does its job very well: effective online fun and with the necessary playability to enjoy your adventures over and over again.,"If you're looking for something easy and simple to pick up and play with your friends, Strange Brigade is definitely worth considering...However, if you're interested in something more challenging and intense, or simply want something with better presentation, Strange Brigade isn't the title for you.","Strange Brigade from developer Rebellion, the studio behind the Sniper Elite series, presents a bright, camp, and vivid swashbuckling Indiana Jones-inspired world come to life. In a third-person shooter where teaming up with friends to take on hordes of supernatural creatures encourages experimentation. Oh, and it’s a lot of fun too.","Whilst Strange Brigade may pose a striking resemblance to Rebellion’s Sniper Elite series in certain areas, this is certainly a game that holds its own. With enjoyable combat, luscious locations, fantastically designed puzzles and some brilliant storytelling, this is certainly a game that leaves a lasting impression.",,,"While Strange Brigade can be frustrating at times, the charm of its 1930s world, the wonderfully exaggerated English alliteration of its narrator, and solid level design, combat encounters, and four-player co-op make it a strong, stylish third-person shooter.",,,"However you decide to play Strange Brigade, one thing is for certain: you’re going to have a hell of a lot of fun. The storytelling and humour balanced against an excellent mixture of gunplay, adventuring and puzzle solving works incredibly well. And the world created by Rebellion is an absolute joy to explore. It takes the formula set by Zombie Army Trilogy, but expands on it in pretty much every way: it’s funnier, better looking, more varied, and bigger in all senses. As far as third-person shooters go, Strange Brigade is up there with the best of them.",,"I really enjoyed my time with Strange Brigade. It was both fun and exciting to see what the next level had in store for me, and having some buddies to play it with made it even more fun. Even if you don’t have friends to play it with, the random joined player can’t really mess you up and playing solo isn’t a bad deal either. While some of the levels can get a little long in the tooth, it was a fun ride that I think any action shooter fan will enjoy and get a lot out of even for only 8-10 hours. Give it a shot. You may even chuckle at some of the narrator’s jokes.",,,,"A wondrous shiny, if slightly flawed, treasure that's deserving of your time, Strange Brigade is enormously entertaining when played solo, even better when you bring a troupe of fellow adventurers along for the ride. Strange Brigade is indeed rather strange, but it's also ripping good fun, best played with a nice cup of tea. Preferably Earl Grey.",,,"An amusing adventure that makes a powerful case for more creativity with level design, setting, and pacing in co-op shooters, without thoroughly capitalizing on all of its own best ideas. Traps and their extensive use within many of the levels are a joy, and the underpinning gunplay is strong enough to warrant a sturdy recommendation, but it all comes to a head well before it should.","Rebellion has wrought a breezy shooter, angled it towards multiplayer, and burnished it with wit, but its minute-to-minute action is repetitive and feels imprecise.",,"As long as you have good company, Strange Brigade is an expedition worth undertaking. However, that doesn’t excuse the many issues the title has. The game would have benefited from refinements both to the aiming system, as well as puzzle design. Still, this cadaver-blasting, treasure looting adventure is an enjoyable enough reason to gather a few friends together for, as long as you know what you’re getting into.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"A thrilling adventure game that is sure to please, Strange Brigade does almost everything right. There were too many things I liked about the game to mention (graphics and sound are also top notch). This isn’t Rebellion’s first third-person shooter, and the growth of quality has increased with maturity. The Egyptian theme is everywhere, from the menu system to the excellent narration. It’s as if you were playing an action movie, with the brigade seeming to have their own personal agendas that happen to coincide with saving the world. After the credits roll, you’re more than likely going to go back to the menu and continue playing.",,,A season pass promises new characters and campaign missions. I can only hope they also bring along much needed variety to the gameplay.,"Mixing the best parts of Left 4 Dead and adventure epics like Indiana Jones and Uncharted, Strange Brigade is better than it has any right to be. Enjoyable solo or with mates, the puzzles and the open level design gives the game replayability, but the pacing and the derivative art direction stop it from being immensely compelling.","Despite a largely forgettable story, Strange Brigade has a lot of charm because of its campy nature and likable, chatty characters. While best in groups, this will also suit patient types who’ve got a good shot and lots of time to kill. Kudos to Rebellion for taking a chance and delivering something wildly different from Sniper Elite.",,"If you're in the mood for a co-op shooter, Strange Brigade is a worthwhile pickup. The game has many unique modes of play that keep it from getting repetitive quickly. I had a lot of fun with the game, especially in co-op, but also in single player as well. The game mainly shines when fighting enemy waves and all modes focus on enemy combat but there is some good variety thrown in during campaign to keep it feeling fresh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Strange Brigade has a nice mix of third-person shooting, puzzles, and humor that ends too soon and costs too much.",,,,,"There’s so much to like about Rebellion’s squad shooter that most of its negative points cease to matter very much. It’s not perfect by any stretch, but it’s a confident romp by a developer that knows its audience.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite some of its shortcomings; I highly recommend playing Strange Brigade. Yes, the loot system can leave much to be desired, and the gameplay can be a bit frustrating at times, but it’s great fun, especially with friends. Oh, and the addition of lots of collectibles and a horde-like mode add a high replay value. It’s a solid title to add to your collection. Grab some friends and go onward Brigade!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rebellion serves up another enjoyably pulpy shooter, though Strange Brigade struggles to stand out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While I’m not overly keen on Talking Points and The Devils and The Details, I think Quiplash, Champ’d up and Blathers are going to be the main winners here to encourage fans to buy the new pack, making the price of entry worth it – especially if you’ve got a gathering (virtual or otherwise) coming up soon.",,"Still fun, despite its age, and despite the fact these games aren’t being played the way they were probably originally intended.

I’ve come to expect that one or two of the games might not be great, but with three of the games here being complete duds, this is probably the poorest Party Pack yet. In its favour, The Jackbox Party Pack 7 is presented as nicely as any Jackbox game always is, and it remains as easy as ever to play with friends.

This is greed at its absolute finest and despite the series’ fame for being colorful and fast-paced, which indeed the game is, there’s just not enough content within to justify its cost. Easy to get into and nostalgic Tempest 4000 may be, but it ultimately becomes bland and uninteresting quite quickly.",,"Tempest 4000 is a fantastic version of a true classic. However, no matter how stunning it looks, or simple it plays it’s definitely not for every gamer out there. Those looking for a legitimate challenge will find it here. Those looking for a deep story or engaging quest will not find anything like that. It’s a simple shooter designed after the tried and true classic Arcade gameplay. Being the Classic Gaming fan that I am, I had an absolute blast playing this, but it might be hard to persuade other gamers to take a look.",,,,,,"In all Tempest 4000 is really a love letter to the original game.

It's one of the most tightly designed games I've ever played in my life and that comes through in every possible way, from UI and art direction to combat and level design. It's without any excess parts, and so its design feels constantly well-reasoned and well-executed and expects you to play it just the same. Across the board, Void Bastards is unforgettable.",,,,,,"Whether you’re being stealthy or outright flamboyant in your pursuits of slag and biomass and plaz, Void Bastards offers up a fresh and engaging take on the first-person rogue light sub-genre in a package that is has the gameplay to match its vibrant art style.","Void Bastards is everything I want from an indie title.

Too bad about a very different perception on the atmosphere of an experience born and created evidently for the virtual reality.",,,"After playing The Persistence on Xbox One I’m sort of disappointed I skipped it on PlayStation VR. The game is really well done and is built in a way that every small step helps; even if I die on a level, as long as I have collected something my time is not wasted. I’m fairly open that horror games are sort of a new passion of mine and I really liked the atmosphere in this game and a big part of that is how good the enemy AI is. There is a lot to like in this game as long as randomized gameplay (rogue light elements) are not a turn off. The Persistence is definitely one of the best rogue light experiences I have played in quite some time and I will likely go back and try the VR origins of this title.",,,,"A sci-fi horror that gets better with perseverance, The Persistence is worth delving into, despite more than a few frustrations. Give it time, though, and you'll ultimately discover a rewarding roguelike experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Being a fan of horror and not a huge fan of rouge-like, I can attest that there’s something special about The Persistence. It’s a weird combination of genres. Sci-fi horror, virtual reality, and rogue-like. However it’s blended extremely well, even without being able to experience it in VR. It’s something you really have to play enough to enjoy. You might not like the first hour or two, but eventually it will grow on you as your character grows in power. After that it’s always “just one more try”. Overall the whole experience might take you around 15 or so hours to complete. With futuristic technology, scary mutants, and sound effects that will raise the hair on your neck, one can’t ask for much more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Persistence is a great entry into the survival horror genre, and I feel that it is best enjoyed in the original VR format. For those entering on Xbox side of this game, this is definitely one I would pick up and take in, even though you won’t get that same immersive VR experience from it. The game still offers a great story and an insane amount of difficulty, which will challenge most experienced players. While it is rather short, the addition of ever-changing maps does add to the ‘freshness’ of the short game, as no playthrough will be the same. Definitely worth a go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Here is where I’ll show my VR snobbery and say that while the graphical fidelity of this version of the game is superior to the PSVR version, the 2D version of the game cannot capture the sense of dread and isolation that the PSVR version has.

It was received well enough that Firesprite decided to port the game to PC and consoles, to be playable without VR hardware. Redesigning a game inherently designed for VR to work well with controllers and mouse and keyboard is no easy task, but Firesprite knocks it out of the park here. The Persistence is an absolutely terrifying horror space roguelike title, from its effective scares to solid gameplay and controls. It's not a totally smooth transition and there are moments where the game can't quite shake its VR roots, but as a whole, The Persistence just works. The Persistence starts aboard a space colony ship and puts players in the shoes of security office Zimri Elder or, rather, her clone. Told from a first-person perspective, Elder must fight against mutants that have seemingly killed the rest of the crew. The goal of the game is to fix the ship and get back home to Earth, which is no easy feat. This is due in part to the game's roguelike elements. Every single time Elder dies, they are ""reborn"" as a new clone and, thanks to some sci-fi plot device, the design of the ship changes and players must purchase or find any upgrades or weapons they had before dying. Related: Down The Rabbit Hole Review - A VR Reimagining of Alice in Wonderland Like most roguelike games, it's not a concept that's particularly endearing to more casual players, but it's also not as challenging as other, more traditional games in the genre. Plus, The Persistence is first and foremost a horror game and it uses that descriptor to great effect. The procedurally generated nature of The Persistence's maps means there's a new surprise around every corner and with it, a new jump-worthy scare. It's all as tense as it sounds and, as effective as it would likely be in a VR setting, it's just as unsettling to watch from the comfort of a couch with a controller in hand. The Persistence mutant The Persistence's combat is simple but fun, with both projectile weapons and close-up combat available. The latter features a parry-like system that's easy to learn but difficult to master while the former doesn't exactly equip players with unlimited ammo and resources with which to buy them. Simply put, players must be smart and not rush into situations because this is very much not a game designed for that. Crouching and sneaking will be your best friend throughout the game's 10 plus hour story mode and even then survival is not a guarantee. Graphically, The Persistence is beautiful to look at and it's easy to imagine how it would look that much better in VR. Regardless, it translates well here, and it uses its dark, ominous lighting juxtaposed with the technologically advanced and sleek design of the ship to maximum effect. And with procedurally generated areas to add to that, there's nearly always a sense of discovery and awe when it comes to exploration aboard The Persistence and its horrifying colony ship. Sponsored Free on PC until May 21 By Epic Games Store For everything that The Persistence does well, however (and that is a lot), there are moments where it feels too obviously like a VR port. Its teleportation mechanic, which requires players to highlight an area and then select it, can be very finicky and unreliable. One can imagine that it would work more flawlessly in VR and it could have used more of a redesign to work smoothly with a controller. Additionally, the targeting reticle to open doors or access computers can sometimes go into an endless loop because all it requires is highlighting an object. Again, this is something that would be smooth and easy on VR, but just a little bit frustrating on console. These are minor design flaws, however, and most can be overlooked because the rest of The Persistence is simply astounding. It's not just a successful port from VR to console and PC, it's a terrifying and unique roguelike/first-person horror hybrid. And every experience will be a new one, which means there's nearly endless scares to be found within. The Persistence is horror gaming done right, and that has little to do with whether it's VR or not.",,,"With a simple but engaging upgrade system; enough weapons and gadgets to make James Bond blush; and a great parrying mechanic that brings an unexpected rhythmic element to combat, this is one title that warrants a purchase even without any fancy VR setup.

It’ll no doubt have its fans, but Mortal Shell could have been so much better with more polish and some tweaks here and there.","Mortal Shell is an action RPG that uses the sleeve of the soulslike genre to create something unique enough to stand on its own two feet. Though its campaign is short and predictable, the beautiful world, interesting body-swapping mechanics, and strong technical performance more than make up for how liberally it borrows from other games.",,,,,"Mortal Shell pays homage to FromSoftware's greats, offering its own unique gameplay wrinkles and an excellent combat system. With only three major dungeons and four weapons, this is a streamlined experience, and if you can push past the slightly frustrating opening hours then you'll find a wonderfully rewarding Souls-like that will keep you coming back for more.","Without fundamentally upsetting the codes inherent in Souls Like, Mortal Shell knows how to adorn itself with a personality of its own, as much thanks to its system of discovery of objects as of combat, which manages to largely compensate for the absence of parry posture with mechanics of hardening, determination and counter-perfect perfectly interwoven.",,,,,,,,,,"I respect the Cold Symmetry team for their courage to put their own twist on the soulslike formula.

Sometimes it's silly, sometimes it can be frustrating, but no matter how the battles go, you manage to have fun. It's quirkiness and overall fun factor give it a charm that not many turn based games of this caliber can even come close to.","One of the best Worms games from the last few years, thanks to old school gameplay coupled with good additions capable of deepening it even more. We're still missing a complete levels editor, hoping it will be added later.",,,,,,,,,,"The usual Worms, fun as ever, with some interesting new feature.

The gameplay remains fluid and responsive throughout, with no shortage of memorable moments born through its nonstop action, as well as its broad variation of unique opportunities. That said, once the game’s grind-wall kicks in towards the end, you’ll start feeling less like a liberator, and more like a liberator’s butler.","Far Cry New Dawn continues the series' year-long descent into self-parody with this uninspired sequel. The spinoffs for Far Cry are usually very exciting, previously taking us to an alternate future or the ancient past. In New Dawn we return to Hope County, now with 300% more pink. Neither the premise nor the execution of the setting and story ever justify the project, but for fans who haven't tired of the series' formula yet, you can't really go wrong with more of the same when it's well done. It's mechanically tight and often engaging while it lasts. Let's just hope New Dawn is actually the setting sun for this version of Far Cry. The series could really use a makeover soon.",,"Far Cry: New Dawn gets many elements from Far Cry 5 adding a more focused world and a good base management component, but it still feels much like its predecessor and with probably the mostly forgettable villains of the entire series.

The RPG elements that were introduced make it feel great and the post-apocalyptic setting has allowed designers to let their imagination run wild, resulting in a truly beautiful world.","Far Cry New Down is an excessive big budget toy, with a lot to do, a lot of guns, and a lot to explore, but with a little bland plot, and some questionable design choices. A very fun and solid adventure nevertheless.","Despite its positive attributes, Far Cry New Dawn feels more like the endgame to Far Cry 5. It's almost like an epilogue that should've been included with the base game, maybe as part of the season pass. In order to properly conclude the story started in Far Cry 5, you have to play Far Cry New Dawn.","This blueprint is still fun, don’t get me wrong, but if anything New Dawn represents more of a sunset on an old design sheet. Might be time to drop a figurative nuclear bomb on Far Cry as we know it right now, in an effort to rebuild, from the ground up; something new and contemporary for the brave new world ahead of us.

The more limited scope means no add-on features (like Far Cry Arcade) and no season pass, but it also allowed for some experimentation that you don't usually see in a AAA title.

While it’s certainly not the best game in the franchise, or even the second or third best, it’s a very solid affair, and one that offers good value for its price tag. You’ll get a lot out of this game, including fun, a good challenge, lots of side content and some very dangerous and difficult beasts to hunt. If you’ve never been a fan of the series, then Far Cry: New Dawn won’t win you over. However, if you’ve ever enjoyed one of these games, or happen to really enjoy this type of experience, it’s well worth picking up.","From a big picture perspective, Far Cry: New Dawn is fine. It hits a lot of checkboxes that have come to define what Far Cry is and manages to wring some newness and intrigue out of its reused map. While the storytelling is even more unfocused than the previous game (though much less disappointing, due to a noticeable walkback on pretense), new gameplay additions like breezy RPG progression and the Expedition missions make it a fun ride all the way through. Far Cry: New Dawn still has a lot of familiar snags, but the overall experience makes for a solid weekend or two of Hollywood-style gaming.",,,,,,,,,,"Just like the series, Far Cry New Dawn is a game of exploration and self-discovery. Despite flaws and bumps along the way, New Dawn captures new magic and shows a glimmer of what the future of the Far Cry series looks like. Now if only Ubisoft could match the game design with equal level and story quality, we may be able to see the series capstone game in Far Cry 6.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
scourgebringer,,,,,,"Roguelite lovers will enjoy ScourgeBringer I feel.

It’s a good example of the genre and well worth a look, especially as it’s included in Gamepass!",,,,,,,,"Scourgebringer on Xbox One is a challenging game that is easy to get sucked into. The mechanics are solid, the artstyle clean, and there is a ton of replayability because, frankly, you’ll need to play it a ton if you want to get to the last boss. If you’re a fan of games like Enter the Gungeon and you’re open to a shift in perspective, then make sure Scourgebringer is the next game you play.",,,,,,"There seems to have been a number of brilliant Rogue-likes released in the last few months, and ScourgeBringer is among the best of them. Its retro-styled visuals may not be to everyone’s tastes, but everything moves at such a quick pace that you hardly have time to fixate on them. Besides, I think they have character. The game’s soundtrack certainly does, moving between airy, atmospheric melodies when you’re exploring, to full-on metal that will make you want to bang your head as you obliterate any enemies that stand in your way. This is a must-play for fans of the genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a roguelite with a great combat system, really tight controls and beautiful art style, but its novelty wears off sooner that we would have liked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"All in all, I think anyone who plays either roguelike's or platform genres will enjoy playing ScourgeBringer. I found it an entertaining game for when I wanted to get in a game and smash some bad guys, even for a short period of time. As an action platformer, ScourgeBringer is a really great example, even if it is a bit short. As a roguelike, it checks the boxes but doesn’t really do much else that's unique. Give ScourgeBringer a shot if you like either of these styles of games and want a challenge, plus it's on GamePass as well.",,,,,,,,ScourgeBringer is a fun but extremely difficult roguelike that'll appeal to a very niche crowd. If you enjoy a soul-crushing challenge then go ahead but be warned; it's one of the most frustratingly difficult games out there and it punishes you heavily for your mistakes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A great looking, challenging rogue-like game with a crazy heavy metal soundtrack to pump you up.

The Drakes you collect along the way, the islands you get to visit and the exploration are many of the great highlights of Drake Hollow. As you explore more islands, you get to see more areas, collect more supplies and make a grander, better camp. Who wouldn't want that in a video game? I'm excited to explore more, collect more and see what the worlds have to offer me. Gotta go, enemies are raiding my camp!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There’s a few hours to be whittled away in Drake Hollow.

Unfortunately as a solo experience, it erred more toward frustration because of the timed mechanics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Odd design choices and an unsatisfying yet incredibly demanding gameplay loop mar a game that boasts the cutest plant people in video games.

Despite this though, I do feel that $49.99 is a bit too high. Let me explain why as this pertains to how I value the content within the title itself. For me, MotoGP 19's multiplayer and quick race options don't really interest me. Its pro mode career is something that not only will leave me frustrated to the point of not playing the game, but also provides such an experience that it doesn't keep my desire to continue playing. Where MotoGP 19 really shines is in the standard career mode and its historical challenges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The shortcomings (pun intended) of the game are balanced with its irresistible charm and appeal and ultimately the running time is reduced only to a face value.

It offers us instant entertainment with a great price thanks to a variety of game modes and different vehicles that we can customize.,"If the idea of racing pint-sized cars around on gigantic-looking tabletop tracks sounds like a good time, you'll probably get more than your money's worth from Table Top Racing. With a launch price of $14.99, it packs plenty of bang for the buck.",,"Table Top Racing World Tour is already a hell of an addictive little racer, but its long term charm completely relies on the online community – something that past history proves is a tricky proposition. It’s currently got just enough variety and draw to keep you going back for more, but it won’t be long before you find yourself exhausting everything the single player brings and that is when you’ll start looking for something extra. Should the online side really take off though, then, well, this could be a table top racer to challenge the very best.",,,,,,"From time to time Table Top Racing: World Tour can feel a bit mundane; like it’s missing a certain je ne sais quoi. It’s a game I keep coming back to though, playing the odd hour here and there between other titles, and with this approach I greatly appreciate its charm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Table Top Racing is a worthy competitor in the miniaturized car racing scene. For the most part, the issues I had with the game are small and didn’t significantly impede my enjoyment of the game. It offers a nice variety of tracks, including multiple variations of those tracks, and a nice selection of cars with fictitious names but recognizable features. Its campaign is a decent length, certainly into the double figures for a number of hours to completion, without being all too repetitive, on top of which it offers standalone ‘special’ championship races and online racing. In all, for some combat racing on Xbox One, this is worth a look.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In the end, Table Top Racing: World Tour is fine. The physics can be wonky at times, and the upgrade system is laughable given the large coin payout per race, but the racing itself is solid enough that a few people will be able to overlook those flaws. It's a solid single-player experience due to the game's overall length, but with inactive multiplayer community, it becomes a tough sell. It's cheap enough that people who don't normally play multiplayer in their racing games won't mind anyway, but for those looking for a more complete arcade-style racing experience on the Xbox One, World Tour falls squarely in the middle of the pack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Table Top Racing: World Tour is not a bad game per se, but it lacks the ""spark"" we felt playing classics of the genre like Re-Volt or MicroMachines. There's a lot of content to go through, tons of events and championships to win, but at the same time there's lot of repetitiveness, and the AI-controlled cars can be real jerks. The biggest flaw, however, is the lack of a split-screen multiplayer mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s aesthetics are beautiful, both on and off the court especially in regards to its player models, which are stunning.

The core basketball game and its various modes offer plenty of chances to have a fun basketball experience. The new animation system makes action on the court look and act more realistic than ever, and a robust training mode gives plenty of opportunity to improve. Unfortunately, lifeless, canned commentary and little in the way of capturing the feel of basketball culture holds NBA Live 19 back.

afterparty,,,,,,If you’re a lover of story games this is one for you! Unlike many story games Afterparty has many twists – and just as many types of drinks to consume.

Well, not so bad, the typical one that doesn't bother you, but you don't remember the next morning as is my case now. I really liked the cocktails and their effects on me, I had a good time playing drunk games and I have to admit that almost all the people I met seemed interesting, with good palique and without curling up too much. Perhaps I would have been more comfortable in a less guiri environment, but hey, you know what Benidorm is…. If I had to put a note at night I would say an eight.

chime-sharp,,,,,,,"With throwback games being all the rage in independent development, many developers have chosen to go the 8/16-bit, pixelated, ""ain't this cute?"" route to tap into nostalgia while bringing along more modern systems and mechanics.

samurai-jack-battle-through-time,,,,,,"Even though I’d not seen an episode of the show before playing I was really rather taken with Samurai Jack: Battle Though Time. It looks great, the combat is fun and fluid, there’s lots to do with upgrading Jack’s abilities, and lots of replayability with the different difficulties and scores to beat. A great game all round and one worth checking out.",,,,,,"Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time is a hack and slash adventure with a few platforming elements. If you like taking on punishingly difficult hordes of enemies and proving your fighting prowess, you'll enjoy this game.",,,,,"Even if you’re not a Samurai Jack superfan, Battle Through Time may be worth a playthrough just for the refresher course in how action games used to work and how vital that style can still be in 2020. There are plenty of quirks that come with the game’s curious dedication to the past, but the overall package excels despite them. Following so many slow, tanky duels with skeletons that can take you out in one hit, it’s a blast to tear through countless rock creatures with a single smash of a spiked club.",,,"It’s just a shame that Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time‘s combat hasn’t been given a little more care and attention to ensure that it flows better. With there being so much of it, its clunky nature drags the game down a fair bit. Still, if you’re a huge Samurai Jack fan who wants to spend some more time with the character, it’s worth a play. But if you have experience with the likes of Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden, you will find its gameplay lacking.",,"At $40 it has a lot to offer. I never found myself angry or bored revisiting previous levels. There’s a fair bit of content for that $40, it’s just that it isn’t perfect and one should know that going into Battle Through Time. Fans of Samurai Jack however will most likely love this game as it canonically takes place during the final season as Jack is trapped in time. I also think Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time is great for both adults and kids (whilemost action games nowadays definitely leans to a predominately adult audience). Definitely check it out in that downtime between big releases as there’s plenty here to be impressed by.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time is a love letter to the animated series and a throwback to classic platform action games of the PS2 era, in the best possible way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time definitely doesn't offer anything particularly groundbreaking but it does feature satisfying old-school hack and slash fun that's hard not to enjoy. Throw in some RPG elements and you're left with a solid albeit lackluster experience.,,,,,,,,,"Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time occasionally stumbles, but it often manages to be a strong showcase for the TV series.",,,,"A great adaptation of the Samurai Jack cartoon, full of hack and slash action, cool weapons and a beautiful art style.

evolve,"Evolve is a a Kraken [sorry] game when it all comes together. But most matches won't have the perfect setup - and it's not always worth sitting through them to get to the good ones. [Apr 2015, p.73]",,"Evolve is a good multiplayer game, but combat suffers due to the design focus on the evolution aspect of the monster. Monsters are forced to flee during 15 minutes and Hunters to chase marks on the screen rather than to hunt it down with the help of their skills and the environment. There is only so much joy you can derive from playing Evolve; it rapidly reaches a plateau and loses the thrill of the hunt.",,,,,"Still, despite my issues with the hunter role outside of battle, I can’t deny I’ve had some fun with Evolve. It’s certainly a memorable experience, more so with a group of friends working together, but still enjoyable with random online players in tow.","If you're looking for a game to expressly play with your online friends, Evolve will please you with an innovative multiplayer experience. But its pretty generic and forgettable maps and overall lack of edge could tire you and your friends pretty quickly.",,,,"Evolve deserves its time in consumer hands and is a game that should not be so easily forgotten, but it does need some work to regain momentum.",,,,That it’s so mechanically rich and still conveys the raw energy and fun of duking it out with huge monsters and action-figure-esque hunters is a real design feat.,"Turtle Rock Studios' brand of Asymmetrical Multiplayer in Evolve is right up there with the very best that we've seen, with a complimentary presentation to match. For anyone looking for a reprieve from military shooters, Evolve can be an exhilarating change of pace.",,,,"Evolve accomplished what it set out to do, and I am having a blast learning all the concepts it delivers. As long as I have friends to play with, it will continue to be in my rotation of games to play. My only concern is fatigue setting in with some players, and the base dwindling. This will kill the game, as playing solo is simply not the route to go.",,,,"Evolve is brilliant in the right circumstances and with the right people, but it’s hard to unreservedly recommend to everyone. Those with dedicated teams will get the most out of the game while those in matchmaking will find mixed results. Still, Turtle Rock deserves recognition for attempting - and almost nailing - such an ambitious project.",,,,,,,,,"Evolve delivers small doses of excellence, but the entire experience is rarely exciting. The big-boss battles are stressfully manic in the best possible way, it’s just a shame that the rest of the game is so boring.","When Evolve is at its best, it is one of the greatest co-op experiences ever crafted. Few games require so much teamwork and are as satisfying when everything falls into place. Conversely, it can be a complete mess when played with hunters that are incompetent or not playing their position.",,"Evolve stands as a testament to Turtle Rock's unique approach to online multiplayer, and is one of the most enjoyable competitive and cooperative experiences we've had so far this generation.",Evolve is a novel take on the cooperative and competitive multiplayer genre. The game is packed with interesting ideas but some work better than others. The fact that characters are locked at the beginning weighs it down by a wide margin and the erratic matchmaking also puts a damper on the whole thing.,,,"The main Hunt gametype is an exceptional experience that, although featuring some familiar mechanics, feels unlike anything else in the genre. The matches have huge diversity, and all create some thrilling rhythm from the mix of hunting and chasing and fighting.",,,,"At long last, the final game is here, and remains true to what we've seen before; Evolve is a concentrated and highly replayable experience, if you can accept the limitations of its unique format.","A great idea in theory, but in practise the novelty wears out extremely quickly, with a serious lack of variety in game modes, maps, and tactics.","Beautiful as Evolve is, looks alone can’t make a game. The skeleton of a better game is visible just beneath the surface, but numerous glaring imbalances and questionable design choices ensure that there’s sadly little meat left on these bones. The thrill of the hunt is mitigated in the best of matches, and rendered altogether pointless in the worst.",,,,Evolve is the most fun and unique multiplayer game that I have played.,"A good asymmetrical game that fails to deliver a complete experience due to its lack of variety on game modes and a player progression that doesn't hit the right trigger. Evolve is not a game that you are going to remember because of its variety, but it's pretty damn fun.","Engaging and unique, but with a lot of issues both on the design and the technical side. It deserves your attention but it could have been so much better.",,,,,,,,"Evolve isn’t perfect, but it is fun. I haven’t decided if it has enough content to justify its full retail price tag, so it’ll be interesting to see how long the community sticks with it.",,,,,"Evolve is exactly as satisfying as the people you're playing with. It serves a concept that is so precise that anything less than perfect unison between participants results in a confused mess. But when it all comes together, when your fellow players are all singing from the same hymn sheet, there’ are few more striking multiplayer experiences to be had.",,,,,,"Evolve challenges every kind of player and tries to remind us how important and fun playing co-op in video games can be. It also helps us move on from the single player scenario thanks to the online mode. Gather your friends, build your team and get ready for a hunt. Try to survive as long as you can.",,,,,,,,,,"Designing a multiplayer game with inherent asymmetry is quite ambitious. To make it a white knuckle action title geared towards seriously competitive players could be considered lunacy. Yet, this is what Turtle Rock attempted, and, for the most part, made work.","Evolve has some of the best ingredients to make a good multiplayer experience, but it's up to the community to make this a game that's constantly in rotation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Content-wise, it is anything but exceptional, and survives only thanks to the variety of its gameplay. The fineness of the game mechanics and the quality of the experience with friends, however, are so high that we find it difficult not reward it.",,,,,,,"While it’s high points are among the most fun I’ve had in recent memory, it’s problems and low points ultimately win out. If you have a solid group of five you can count on to play with at all times, Evolve might be worth a look. With some balancing, I could even see Evolve becoming quite popular among the hardcore e-sports types. For the rest of us who just want to jump in and have some fun, I’d recommend looking elsewhere.",,,,"Like Left 4 Dead before it, Evolve is a game that feels slightly under-nourished at times, but which takes the crummy old co-op FPS wheel and totally re-invents it.","Evolve is a great, but sadly unreliable, experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In a world of overcrowded shooters, I've grown to enjoy Evolve and the uniqueness it brings to the table. One item that should be noted, though, is the shakiness of the game's shooting mechanics. While I mostly embraced the Assault class for a chunk of the review, that only made the iffy physics surrounding aiming and firing that much more apparent. Aiming doesn't get much easier with the monsters and when Goliath's arsenal contains a ""rock throw"" ability, not being able to reliably aim is a killer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"What could have been an underground smash as a budget download has been spread thin to justify a AAA price, leading to grave concerns about its glacial progression, value, longevity and DLC strategy. Though still utterly fantastic under optimal conditions, Evolve asks far too much for an inconsistently enjoyable experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
minit,"A novel, if somewhat stressful, take on what is a fairly familiar theme. [June 2018, p.76]",,,,,"Minit goes to show what a capable developer can do with such a small canvas. This game isn’t going to be for everyone, but those that enjoy quirky adventures should certainly have this on their radar. The minute mechanic, grouped with the solid world design and interesting progression structure, collectively amounts to a worthwhile trek, if indeed a short one.",,,,,"Minit is as much fun as it is unique, and it sets standards that will soon be used in other games, maybe more popular, but not as original as Minit.",,,,,,,,,"It's always great to see a videogame try and do something different, and Minit does so with gusto: it takes a tried-and-tested formula and turns it on its head with one very simple mechanic. It makes a standard adventure game into a test of memory, of patience, of skill, and even though it'll frustrate you, it'll have you coming back for ""just one minute"" time and time again.",,,,,,,"To die every 60 seconds could quickly get old, but Minit is smart enough to avoid any kind of frustration during the adventure. Purposely minimalistic, the pixelated art direction shines with personality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While a minute may not seem like a long time, Minit shows just how big or small those 60 seconds can feel. Some may be busy and eventful, others may feel like they amount to nothing, but every single one is an important stepping stone. This is a fantastic game that appreciates your time and makes you appreciate it as well.",,,,,,,"Don't let the simple retro look fool you, Minit is an interesting and innovative game that's likely different that anything else that you've played recently.",,,,,,"Minit lives and dies by the time-constraining gimmick it possesses. The constant specter of death makes the short quest feel like an epic adventure, but the game as a whole doesn't rise above being more than a curious novelty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But in all other senses, the rock has been dropped here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rock of Ages 3: Make & Break may have worked better as an add-on for the previous title. It has a great level editor and sharing features which, paired with the numerous multiplayer modes, makes for limitless potential. The core campaign feels tacked-on in comparison, like a large batch of basic, user-created levels rather than something professionally crafted. This entry gives the impression of being more about quantity than quality, but at least the core gameplay is familiar and can still be fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rock of Ages 3: Make & Break is an absolute blast to play. It’s incredibly simple to learn, but still challenging enough to force me to approach certain levels strategically. I loved playing the local multiplayer with my kids, even if it was a bit more challenging with the reduced field-of-view. The single-player campaign alone will take most players a good six+ hours to complete, plus you add in the limitless content created by fellow gamers, and you’ll get plenty of enjoyment out of Rock of Ages 3. This has been one of the most fun games I’ve played this year and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing time with a fun sense of humour.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rock of Ages 3: Make & Break is the best in the series yet so if you enjoy smashing things by rolling a giant boulder around and setting up traps to mess with your foes then you'll have a blast making and breaking in this fun-filled sequel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

onimusha-warlords,"Not an especially great game, but an enjoyable nostalgia-trip nonetheless.",,,,,"Onimusha: Warlords still holds up exceptionally well nearly twenty years since its original release. Capcom’s ability to merge historical events with such a fantastical and engaging plot, together with a gameplay foundation that’s well paced, deep, and constantly exciting, is precisely why this classic is so highly regarded. Whilst Warlords is indeed unforgivably short, this is one Capcom comeback that you simply must have.","Onimusha: Warlords wasn’t revolutionary when it launched in 2001, but it was certainly good and time has been kind to it. This remaster offers a fresh overhaul of the game’s visuals and gameplay that make it feel accessible and enjoyable for a modern audience. The gameplay itself holds up quite well despite lacking the depth some other action titles have, with a variety of enemies and weapons to fight and wield. The story is horrendous and the camera can be difficult, but exploring the world has a nice flow to it that alleviates some of that.

It can be incredibly fun despite some its shortcomings, but those shortcomings are visible in a number of important areas that keep this good revival of the popular Rainbow Six franchise from being great.",,,,"Rainbow Six Siege is a nice return for the series, but know about its caveats before diving in. This is a team game. Communication is necessary, and it is not a twitch shooter. If those things sound appealing, then Siege is definitely worth the time.",,,,"Tense, dramatic and unique, Rainbow Six: Siege feels and plays unlike any other shooter on the market. It’s not perfect but it can be great fun. We just wish there was more of it.",,,Few modern shooters can match the heart-pounding exhilaration and immense strategic depth Siege achieves with its asymmetrical PvP.,,,,,"The bizarre progression hooks Siege borrows from free-to-play games, its dearth of content and its network problems make for an awful lot of frustration to overcome in search of those rare moments of unit cohesion.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Fans of the well-crafted, single-player campaigns of previous Rainbow Six games will find nothing of value in Siege. The short tutorial missions lack replay value, and the popular Terrorist Hunt mode, which can be played with up to five friends, gives players little options other than ramping up the difficulty. Locking players out of selecting the map they want to play on is a curious decision, as are many of the battle tactics you see the enemy A.I. employ.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Rainbow Six: Siege is an intelligent and quality shooter that allows for varied approaches. It is, however, unfortunately held back by repetition, server issues and a noticeable lack of variety.

While three modes doesn't sound like a lot, the sheer volume of variables involved will result in an experience that constantly stays fresh, even with the current pool of 11 maps. While a few other major shooters have let me down this year, I think Siege is one of the games I'll be playing the most going forward.","What Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege lacks in content it makes up for in intense, fast-paced, heart-pounding action and tight gameplay. If tactical multiplayer is your thing, there may be none better. If not, though, you’ll likely find the experience to be a bit bare bones.",,,"As intricate as the multiplayer is, the lack of a true campaign or other content beyond terrorist hunt leaves the entire Rainbow Six Siege package of offerings feeling somewhat light, especially in comparison to something like Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which has a campaign and zombies to go along with its signature shooter experience.",,,,"Tactics, action and working together are the pillars of Rainbow Six Siege. Attacking and defending bring endless online fun, especially when you play with people you know in a team. If not, the bugs might make your game somewhat annoying.",,,,"Underneath the silly cash grab lies a genuinely fun multiplayer game. Siege took me back to the early days of Counter-Strike, when I would lose weeks at a time to endless late night sessions with friends.

Spectacle, good music, tuning, racing and lots of fun.",,"There is fun to be had here, but in light of what else is out in the racing/driving wild these days, leaves Heat eating proverbial dust. There’s no question Ghost is a technically proficient developer (outside of car physics), but too much emphasis on a ‘story’ over more robust driving and driver-agency makes the game feel half complete on one side, and half over done on the other.","Need for Speed Heat is fast, furious, fun, and the best Need for Speed game of recent years.",,,Need for Speed Heat is a mosaic of existing ideas but it is easily the most impressive Need for Speed game in years.,,Need for Speed: Heat is a welcome return to the atmosphere that made the series great. A general lack of cleanliness and finish prevents the title from making the leap in quality but it is still a product that will satisfy its audience.,"A triumphant return to form for a series that has gone off the track in recent years. With its nail-biting police chases and electrifying sense of speed, Need for Speed Heat is the most exciting and tense arcade racing game we’ve had the pleasure of playing in years. It proves that there’s life in the old dog yet, even in a world in which Forza Horizon exists, and we’re very glad of that.",Need for Speed Heat has a great visual style that smartly leans into the tuner culture that helped set the series apart in games like Most Wanted and Underground. Unfortunately its sluggish progression and weak online offerings keep this from reaching the heights of the series.,"Ultimately, Need for Speed: Heat is a decent racer. In fact, I would say it is a great playing one. It’s just missing something new. Since Most Wanted on the 360, the formula hasn’t changed much. Payback tried to, but never really came into its own. Heat has everything that is needed to make a fun racing game, and it does so very well. Maybe I’m just looking for something and don’t really know what it is. I enjoyed my time with Heat and I’m sure other arcade racing fans will too. It’s a solid game that plays and looks great, even with the little grind that may come along with it.",,,,,"This Need for Speed has everything it needs to please the players, especially those looking for an heir to Most Wanted. But Heat lacks of driving sensations, of a proper physic management, and has plenty of balance problems, making the game more frustrating than fun.",,,,,,,"Need for Speed Heat seems limited, reminding me of all the things that made it distinct, but still hedging against them in case I don’t find them enjoyable. I’m confused about what would have made this game better, but the series seems just as confused about what it wants to be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's clear that Ghost Games has taken a touch of Paradise and applied it to Heat, resulting in a thrilling and beautiful racing game that's bursting with things to do. Though their ambition was bold, they strayed too far from comfort in putting Heat together. When measured up against its own franchise, Heat does a lot to move the series in the right direction and it's a clear, marked improvement over Payback.","Need for Speed Heat is ultimately enjoyable, an experience that can provide some high highs alongside some fairly low lows. Those looking for a new racing experience will certainly enjoy it, once mastering its quirks.",,,"Need for Speed Heat is an ideal game for fans of the saga. It has everything: Tuning, day and night races, police chases. Of course, Palm City is a little small, the police is too tired appearing in all night races and the story doesn't bring anything new. Despite this, the multiplayer system, the control of the vehicles and its technical section put us in a great arcade driving game.","Need for Speed Heat wakes up the series from the nightmare and it's just like a greatest hits of the most iconic episodes of the franchise. Ghost Games did a great job in terms of gameplay and concepts, but Palm City is bloated of filler events and the progression isn't smooth enough. Anyway, the night races are great and the free tuning is back. If you are driven by Underground and Most Wanted nostalgia, Heat is definitely your game.","Heat is an enjoyable racing game, but Ghost Games need to do something to truly revitalize the franchise. Need for Speed used to lead the genre, and now it’s looking at other racing games to patch their formula.",,,,,,,Need For Speed Heat is a return to form for the series and the best entry this generation.

Customization is clean and maximizes personalization.

But, at the end of the day it works and the few additions that Heat does bring to the formula help it stand apart. Need for Speed: Heat is a return to form for the series, and a great foundation to rebuild the tattered franchise on.","At the end of the day, Need for Speed Heat is a decent arcade racer that racing fans will enjoy, but shouldn’t be expecting a top tier title like others in the series or in comparison to premier arcade racers like the Forza Horizon. At the end of the day, if you’re looking for a new Need for Speed game, this brings police chases and big crashes to an average at best title.","While this installment isn’t the most innovative, that isn’t what Need for Speed needs right now. It needs to build up a solid foundation again, so it can get itself into a good position to ride the slipstream behind other titles, ready itself, then overtake it to possibly come out on top. There are some strong elements here, and the balance between day and night activities can provide a good loop. It handles well, not letting obstacles get in people’s way, and gives folks a lot of extras to shoot for. Yes, it could use a more lifelike world, a more interesting story, and a better soundtrack. But, what’s here is fun. That’s what matters most right now.",,"This latest Need for Speed doesn’t have any luck-based schemes disrupting the progression this time around, but there’s nothing moving the series forward either. The core parts that have been strong in the past aren’t quite as potent here, and the supporting elements feel directionless and half-baked. Need for Speed Heat is like a beat up old ride that’s still good to burn some rubber and get you around town, but don’t expect to turn any heads along the way.",,,,,"Need for Speed Heat boasts a large varied world and a cool gameplay twist with the addition of cops who are often on your tail.

a-hat-in-time,An honest and charming attempt to reinvigorate the 3D platformer genre.,,,,,A Hat in Time is a sensational platformer that boasts hours upon hours of inventive and diverse fun.,"A Hat In Time is a game that is proud to wear its influences on its sleeve and largely does them justice. The 3D platformer features a quirky story, diverse and memorable levels, interesting well-voiced characters, and collectibles that actually have a point. The platforming is responsive and the difficulty scales appropriately on the whole, but the game is let down by camera issues — clipping through objects, zooming in at inappropriate times, and shaking all contribute to unfair deaths for the player, often at the worst possible moment. There's something here for players of all abilities and most will be able to look past its faults for another enjoyable completion.","Reasonable people can disagree on whether and how heavily to weigh its off-screen issues. What’s less open to debate, however, is how much this game is weighed down by wonky controls and an even wonkier camera. There are other, much better 3D platformers out there, and they’re much more deserving of our time and your money.","A classical collectathon 3D platformer, with lots of charm and variety. It could have used a higher challenge level and it's got some performance issues, but it will surely please any platform game lover.",A Hat in Time is a game as adorable as mature.

Inspired by classic such as Super Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie and little bites of Luigi's Mansion, it has enough personality to feel original and make its own adventure.",,,A Hat in Time is a top piece of work from a developer who embraces all that is great about an old style 3D platformer and then makes it their own with innovative and insightful fresh ideas.,,,,,,"I applaud Gears for Breakfast for their ideas and vision, as A Hat in Time is in many ways truly original. I’m just really disappointed it wasn’t better executed in terms of technical finesse.",,A Hat in Time is probably the best platformer released this year that doesn’t star that one plumber guy. Anyone who still has fond memories of classic N64 platformers owe it to themselves to check it out. Also for PS4 and XB1 owners this is about as good as it gets without Italian influence. For the price it is more than worth your time. Don’t sleep on this charming title.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A Hat in Time is the kind of game you don't see very often anymore: an incredible fun-for-all-ages romp that isn't exclusive to Nintendo. It's ceaseless dedication to making every moment feel fresh and exciting is admirable – even if a few technical hiccups slipped through the cracks. It's an incredibly fun platformer that never stops surprising. It's the kind of game that just makes you happy. Heck, the game is making me smile right now, and all I'm doing is writing its review.","A Hat in Time lacks polish, but it makes up for its shortcomings with excellent platforming and a universe I was happy to be part of. The whole experience is adorable, and in many ways it improves on the very platformers it uses as inspiration.",,,,,"Despite some snarly camera issues, A Hat in Time should not be overlooked. Behind the vivid graphical style lies a charming and cute platformer that provides even the most experienced players a challenge.

Although A Hat in Time was crafted with love, and has some good moments, it’s overwhelming and obtuse, and lacks cohesion, polish and great gameplay.",,,,"A Hat in Time is a decent game that suffers from some technical issues, and while it doesn't present anything new for the platforming genre, it has the potential to provide a better experience future installments if it thinks out of the box more and more.",,,,,,,"I had hoped for some more originality to be seen in the game’s mechanics or level design, but the lack thereof doesn’t hinder the quality of the experience.

There is no prerequisite that you have prior knowledge of the franchise, so feel free to just dive right in regardless of whether you're a newcomer or a die-hard fan.

Join others around the world as they learn to control their guardians in groups of up to one hundred units while you destroy the Golems and defeat Zahr. The world of Spark awaits you.",,"Masters of Anima has a decent concept and a worthwhile story, but sadly falls short almost everywhere else. The combat is tedious, often unfair and utterly frustrating. Take into account that outside of light puzzle solving and exploration, this is pretty much all that you’ll be doing. It doesn’t help matters that Masters of Anima rarely evolves as you proceed, making for a game that’s not only annoying, but repetitive too.","Masters of Anima is an excellent game that serves as conclusive proof that Pikmin’s legacy is alive and relevant today as much as it ever was. The game’s foundation is its characters who are humorous and lovable throughout the adventure, with exceptional dialogue and voice acting to back them up. The world itself is lacking a bit in visual variety but it makes up for it in level design, which features linearity combined with a reward for off the beaten path exploration.",,,,,"Traditional hack-and-slash mechanics, real-time strategy elements, serviceable writing and excellent visuals and music all come together to create one of 2018's best indie RPGs thus far.",,"If you’re after a unique adventure that borrows ideas from a load of games, but beats its own drum loudly, then Masters of Anima might just be worth adding to your collection.",,,,,,,,Masters of Anima is a frustrating game. The mechanics seem to work against the player creating more chore and less fun. With some tweaks this game could be a sleeper hit for sure.

While Masters of Anima has a couple flaws, I believe this game is worth trying. It may not be my kind of game per se, but I know there are gamers out there that like DOTA-like games, and this has a similar feel to it. If you like strategy based games I would give this one a try. The story is good to follow and I didn't mind the the overall concept of Masters of Anima at all, even though it wasn't my cup of tea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It may not convert those who didn't already love that style of gameplay, but it's giving more of that style of content with its own unique twists that make it a worthy entry in the genre.",,"Deck13 reinterprets the Souls-like genre with a deep and original combat system and more gamer-friendly structure and story. This doesn't save The Surge from its dose of frustrating and repetitive action, though, but it's definitely a ride worth the effort.",The Surge offers an innovative combat and crafting system but it suffers ups and downs on its difficulty and also has a poor script. Even so the result is a worthy action RPG that will live on as an alternative to the Souls Saga.,"The Lords of the Fallen guys, Deck13, have created a great quality title, but despite bringing new mechanics from their previous game, they have left aside other sections.

The shadows are falling away, The Surge is miles better than Lords of the Fallen, and some trademark mechanics are starting to creep into the light. Deck 13 has polished and primed The Surge, and it now feels like it's time to stop comparing it to others and let it be noticed for what it is. Calling anything a Dark Souls clone at this point is purely lazy and an insult to the many smaller ways in which they're no way alike.","It’s safe to say that The Surge completely focuses on providing a souls-like experience from beginning to end, offering up deep combat mechanics with interesting and large-scale boss battles. The story, although engaging to a point, takes a back seat to this singular goal. It’s not without its flaws, and its appeal will primarily be limited to those looking so this one type of experience. But The Surge feels like a success, and one that we’ll probably end up dying several hundred more times in.","The Surge is a game that can be mentioned in the same breath as Dark Souls, something which is high praise indeed.",,,"The Surge makes good use of its detailed sci-fi setting and provides an engaging experience throughout the 30 to 40-hour campaign, mostly thanks to its widely customizable inventory and wickedly fun combat system.

Although the presentation and enemy variety are somewhat lacking, and technical issues occur occasionally, none of these issues come even close to putting a hamper on this thoroughly enjoyable experience. Play. This. Game.","The Surge is a nice addition to the genre. The combat feels great even when the story and mechanics start to sputter out. The claustrophobic nature of the level design adds to the tension, and it feels good to have a game in this genre that isn’t chock full of gothic horror themes. It brings new ideas to the familiar mechanics and executes on them well.",,,,"Every bit as infuriating, enjoyable and insanely gratifying as an action RPG of this type should be, The Surge is great fun, thanks in no small part to its unique limb-cutting loot system and some tight combat mechanics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Surge is a fantastic starting point for those who may be intimidated by the likes of Dark Souls or Nioh.

Despite its niggling flaws, Gigantic is still worthy of your attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gigantic is an accessible MOBA that admirably scales the genre down, but loses the magic that makes the genre so enticing.

The Clash and Guardian system is distinctive and gives a great sense of scale, while the list of heroes is colorful, yet not over-designed.

The bright colours and upbeat jungle soundtrack jump right out at you and Noodle feels like such a likeable character, without him ever saying a word. The levels are short but substantial — they feel really well designed, with a good amount of obstacles and collectibles that don't feel overwhelming. Your time with Noodle and Doodle might be a bit short, and some of the camera angles will really have you struggling, but overall it's a fun and exciting experience that you shouldn't misssssssss.",,"A fresh take on the physics-based puzzle-platformer genre, with an original control system, a charming visual style and a captivating soundtrack. A problematic automatic camera management and some issues with controls and overall performance keep it from reaching its full potential.","Snake Pass is a fun game with original control. A platforms game that remind us the times when the important thing was go through levels and get collectibles. Maybe it's short, but it's different and entertaining. A good game for the old Rare games and the Nintendo 64 fans.",Snake Pass is a peculiar platform game and it will catch us with its colorful design and the different puzzles that we must do by thinking like a snake. 15 levels that may seem easy and repetitive at first but the difficulty will be great in each of them if we want to achieve the different goals that the game proposes to us.,,,"At the end of the day, and if you’re after a relaxing puzzler which will provide a decent test that you can take at your own pace, then Noodle and Doodle will happily sort you out. You may not ever want to really test yourself by collecting all the coins, because some are pretty damn frustrating to hunt down and reach, and the Time Trial option will only really appeal to those who have friends sitting on the leaderboards too, but the basic game is so damn good that neither of those options really hold it back.",,,"Slithering up simple structures in Snake Pass is one of the most mechanically satisfying video game ideas I’ve ever experience, and it effectively creates a sensation that feels the way maneuvering like a snake might. The camera and checkpoint systems aren’t great, but the concept still managed to hook me for the five hours it took wrap up the campaign. And in the end, I wanted to go back and replay stages to round up all the collectibles I missed.",,,A refreshingly unique take on the platforming genre that introduces a duo of instantly likeable characters and a colourful game world where the simple act of moving through it is a reward in itself.,,"Snake Pass is a unique experience and a throwback to classic puzzle/platform games of yesteryear. It is a genre lost in time, and I am thrilled to be seeing a resurgence this year. For the price it is hard not to recommend Snake Pass. It is unique, fun, colorful, and challenging. Definitely worth checking out, even in this blizzard of awesome games hitting already in 2017.",,,,,,,"At times, then, Snake Pass can be a wonderfully relaxing journey through some beautiful habitats. The late game switches into an engaging and challenging puzzler, requiring some deft flicks of the left stick, but one that can feel immensely gratifying when you elegantly slalom your way over a narrow assault course that's suspended over lava. It's the middle third, when the game expects too much of you far too soon, that causes the momentum to stutter. Nevertheless, Snake Pass is a quirky puzzler that innovates while simultaneously evoking memories of your favourite platformers of yesteryear--just don't expect to grow into your new skin overnight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Snake Pass goes beyond the concept of being a snake. It fulfills the promise of a playable snake with flying colors and succeeds in molding levels around its nontraditional movement. Obvious repetition does set it, but at least it's repeating a gameplay loop that's wholly unique. It's not the perfect platformer, but it's a perfect example of an unusual idea fantastically executed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, Snake Pass is a great platformer and there isn’t anything like it on Xbox One. Just when you think that the gaming industry is out of new ideas, this title comes along. While it’s quite simple in terms of story and presentation, the game is addictive and a tremendous amount of fun. If you own an Xbox One, you have to get Snake Pass. It’s that special because of its accessible controls.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Snake Pass' legacy won't be any of that negative stuff I mentioned. It'll be remembered as a quirky thing that's an exemplary example of how games can offer non-traditional experiences. And, to be quite honest, I love it for that. I thoroughly enjoyed my first hour or so as I leaned into its serpentine sensibilities. But, Snake Pass' choice of animal is unfortunately fitting as this game just doesn't have legs.",,,,,,,,,,"Managing to be both nostalgic and refreshingly new, Snake Pass is a glorious adventure that brings the 3D puzzle platformer right up to date. Barring some frustrations and a tough difficulty level, there are few indie games that provide such a thoroughly entertaining, beautifully designed experience as Sumo Digital have created here.",,,,,,"In most platformers, the running and jumping – the movement – is a huge part of the fun. It makes you feel skilled. In Snake Pass, movement amounts to a big fat ball of stress over which I rarely felt like I had firm control. Or at least that was my experience. And that makes it hard to recommend – certainly for the kids towards which it seems to be aimed, and even for die-hard 3D platformer fans.",,,,Snake Pass is filled to the brim with charm. Its unique control system is difficult but fun to try and master.

Shallow and ambitious, but very funny and enjoyable if we are fans of Marvel and his humor. A must to play as a couple.","More of the same, that's what LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 offers. And franchise fans can only cheer for the biggest, most faithful and best LEGO game to date.","While it's true that a LEGO game will never surprise anybody, the individual games can still be tons of fun – especially when you like the property involved. LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 is a blast for Marvel fans, with hundreds of characters great and small, 20 huge levels with full co-op support, and a vast and beautiful open world to explore. True believers will get more than their money's worth from this one.",,"I haven’t had this much fun in a LEGO game since the third Batman iteration, and that’s testament to the new gameplay features, excitingly fresh heroes and intriguing story. It helps that there’s so much to do and plenty of variety to stave off any boredom.",,,,,,Perhaps both the best and worst LEGO game available on Xbox One.,,"LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 is a pure dose of fan service to Marvel enthusiasts, with its long list of characters, recognizable locations and its nods to storylines and in-jokes, but I feel that these games have lost their way over time. It isn’t to say that I didn’t enjoy my time with it, but I certainly won’t be going back to it time and again, trying to achieve that 100% completion stat.",,,,"A case of diminishing returns, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 is certainly ambitious in terms of scale and playable character numbers, while the story is entertaining. Yet it fails to deliver anything really new or interesting, making this a case of been there, done that. The first LEGO Marvel game is better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 changes a bit the original LEGO Games' formula with more action than we used to play, but even with that this games accomplishes almost all its goals. Fun, long and a great homage to Marvel's comic book era.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 is a tried-and-true game for young kids everywhere who like the Marvel universe. There is a bit too much frustration with some parts of the game and the fighting can be very ho-hum for anyone out of diapers. That said, the humor, collection of heroes, length of the game, and overall quality makes this a no-brainer for kids everywhere. Just be ready to help 'em out.",,,,,,,,,,,,"Fun, heroic stuff, especially for younger players. [Issue#195, p.74]",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lego Marvel Super Heroes gives you the feeling that you are saving the Marvel world. Chronopolis is a beautiful designed city and has lots of content. However, the annoying camera and lack of innovations are a pity in this otherwise great game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"What LEGO Marvel Superheroes 2 does really well is what all of the LEGO games do as it provides an entertaining adventure filled with nearly every franchise character you could think of, many of which you may not even know exist. You’ll be smashing bricks, collecting studs, fighting baddies and building objects throughout your adventure, the backbone of any LEGO game experience. For me though, this is more of the same, as it’s essentially the same game I’ve played for about a decade now, causing some fatigue to set in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"LEGO Marvel Superheroes 2 is an extremely satisfying game to play. It captures each and every aspect of the characters as portrayed in the movies, comics, and shows to parade them at their very best.",,,,,,"LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 is in an odd spot where only diehard comic book fans will really appreciate all of its references, but those that already care about these characters will want to see them interact in more meaningful ways. Instead of giving players an interesting original story, it’s just yet another by-the-numbers LEGO title that will leave players occasionally laughing between bouts of frustration between its dull combat and often counterintuitive puzzles. Ultimately, this is one brick that doesn’t have to be collected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the-fall-part-2-unbound,,,,,,"Unbound is bigger than the first game, but not necessarily better. I thoroughly enjoyed the thought provoking story, as well as the intriguing individual character stories. However, the dated visuals and the filler combat mechanics pull this otherwise well rounded experience just short of greatness. That said, the plot is worth the price of admission alone.","The Fall Part 2: Unbound manages to improve on the first game in most ways. Intertwining ARID's story with others is a smart move for the sequel, and each host serves as their own character with their own story to tell. A lot of the improvements come with ARID herself, with extra combat and movement abilities making for much smoother gameplay. The puzzles are genuinely tricky, maybe a little too tricky towards the end, and the lack of hand-holding may mean a few head-scratcher moments. Aside from these small issues, Unbound is an excellent continuation of The Fall and sets up for an exciting trilogy finale.",,"The Fall Part 2: Unbound proved to be a double-sided experience: the first half amazed us with a compelling and thought-provoking story, good puzzles and effective mechanics. All of this gets wasted in the second half of the game, which feels more like a pointless filler to artificially inflate the game length with recycled contents, frustrating puzzles and an unsatisfying ending. A real pity.",,,,,"Whilst The Fall Part 2: Unbound has been put together with super high production values, a stunning story and some great visuals, it is the overall length and drawn out nature of the tale that ultimately holds it back.",,,,,,,"The Fall Part 2: Unbound is a solid follow-up to its predecessor with a moving story and interesting puzzles. It is held back somewhat by occasionally obtuse solutions and bland action sequences, but is well-worth the price of admission for players eager to continue ARID’s story.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Unfortunately, The Fall 2: Unbound does not hit the highs of the first game in the trilogy, as the puzzles seem a little bit more like random luck this time. Answers must be stumbled upon due to the illogical solutions, as the applications to these puzzles could have been better. The story is darker than the first, though, and the gripping journey brings Arid more questions than answers, as Over the Moon Games prepares to bring this trilogy to a close.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Great part two in The Fall series, and leaves the door open just enough ready for part three. If Over the Moon continue with the improvements they’ve made to the next installment, then the trilogy should go down as a true classic of its time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tachyon-project,,,,,,,,,"A solid Geometry Wars-like twin stick shooter, with some innovative elements like a timed countdown system, an interesting storyline and deep ship customization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tachyon Project seems to take a lot of inspiration from Geometry Wars but puts its own spin on things. Taking cues from one of the best twin stick shooters ever made, isn’t a bad thing in the slightest.",,,,"A fine twin-stick shooter, Tachyon Project is good, solid entertainment that's worth whiling away a few hours with.",,,,,,,,,"Relies heavily on the work of its arguably better predecessors. [Issue#128, p.79]","Enjoyable and thrilling while it lasts but also all too short and a shade too easy for those with any sort of skill in the genre, it's one that will surely hit the spot to while away an afternoon. Just don't expect it to last all that much longer than that.",,,,,"Yes, it is short. But Geometry Wars 3 aside I haven’t had that much fun with a twinstick shooter in a while. Be wary of the spiking difficulty in the middle parts though where it moves from challenging to frustrating for a little while.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tachyon Project is a simple and immediate dual stick shooter based on interesting mechanics. Longevity is not its strong point, though.","If you like games a la Geometry Wars, Tachyon Project is a very interesting choice. Solid and fun, twin-stick shooters fans should definitely give it a try.",,,"In the end, Tachyon Project is a half-decent game that will appeal most to a select group of gamers. Despite boasting a unique take on incurred damage, the title’s slower pace and occasionally dull engagements hold it back from being as good as it could’ve been.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tachyon Project does enough things to make itself stand out against the bigger names in the genre and be competent, but falls short on doing much else to really rise above and beyond the kings of the category.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tachyon Project does not reinvent the wheel for twin stick shooters, but it does add some creative new tread that allows it to feel familiar yet fresh at the same time. There are plenty of modes, challenges and customisations to try out, so fans of the genre should have plenty to keep them busy throughout their time with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
attack-on-titan-2,,,,,,"Attack on Titan 2 greatly improves upon its predecessor in nearly every way, but still comes with a few issues such as periodical freezing, and at times, poor control feedback. With these small problems to the side, this game undoubtedly does justice to its source material. Attack on Titan 2 is fast-paced energetic fun at its finest.",,,,"Attack on Titan 2 is an enjoyable and pleasant adventure. It allows us to enjoy the events of both seasons of Attack on Titan anime from a new perspective. Despite its repetitive secondary missions, Koei Tecmo brings us a game that gamers, especially fans of Hajime Isayama's work, will definitely like.",Attack on Titan 2 surpasses its predecessor in everything. It is a real gift for fans of anime and action games. One of a kind.,"While the campaign is rather short, the addictive nature of pulling off stylish moves to sever body parts keeps you coming back for more.",,"In truth, Attack on Titan 2 is more of the same as that found in Attack on Titan: Wings of Freedom – just less exciting and slightly more frustrating in comparison.",,,The fact that it recycles so much of the 2016 game’s material means that in order to get to the new season 2 content you must first wade through a rehashed story mode with its dull sidequests and tedious dialogue choices.,,,"With its wealth of content, more refined and expanded gameplay, and clearly prettier visuals, Attack on Titan 2 is undoubtedly a worthy follow up to the original game.",,"Attack on Titan 2 is definitely a better game than the first. I just wish it was more new than retread. Still for those that skipped the first game it is easy to recommend. You can basically skip the first game as it is almost entirely recreated here, with plenty of quality of life improvements. Add in the co-op and competitive online modes and it is definitely the better package. An action-packed romp that shows Omega Force has chops outside of the normal Dynasty Warriors formula.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,While mechanically and visually A.o.T. 2 shows improvement in almost every aspect to its predecessor the retelling of the “old” story that takes place over two thirds of the campaign playtime is definitely a downer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It may lack the political intrigue of the anime and manga, but there's a great deal of story to digest, and there's a healthy amount of playable content. The lack of enemy variety means that the game is best taken in short bursts, but those with even a passing interest in the series will enjoy Attack on Titan 2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
